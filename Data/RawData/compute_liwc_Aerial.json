[{"repo": "Aerial", "type": "elite", "title": "", "number of text": 1195, "text": "  Pretty good idea especially with the new AerialConfig.app I introduced in 1.4.5 beta2 ! \r\n\r\nI can't do it at installation (I can't do anything at installation !) but I can at first launch indeed ! Thanks for the idea !  @dVIAN13 I thought I could simply pop a dialog box but those don't really exist on macos, we are already the equivalent of a dialog box (a modal sheet). So right now, maybe adding an extra tab to the panel on those older versions of macOS with a checkbox \"I understand\" and until you checked that, when you open preferences it will show that pane ? I'm not sure if AerialConfig.app can detect if Aerial.saver is installed, I'll think about that too as this will be another pain point.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a bit forceful but I was very reluctant to do the AerialConfig.app thing because I knew most people won't read instructions correctly anyway (we had 2 \"done\" button issues in 2 days after all !) @dVIAN13 yep that's the goal, only show to people on < mojave, and only until they click the checkbox (I won't show it on upgrade, etc). I think I'll add a direct link to the config app download in the Advanced tab too. \r\n\r\nI'll remove the tab for mojave and once they click. Here's what I got so far : \r\n\r\n<img width=\"743\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-10-31 a 22 12 53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47819315-666cc680-dd5a-11e8-9ec5-04a98749663f.png\">\r\n\r\n(obviously it won't show on mojave but that's where I made the mockup ;)) Maybe you or @SeanMSmith have opinions about the text ?\r\n\r\nIn raw form : \r\n>On macOS versions prior to 10.14 (Mojave), the Aerial configuration panel has a bug that prevents users to type into textfields. \r\n>\r\n>While Aerial is otherwise usable, this may be frustrating as a few options (setting latitude and longitude, etc) will be unaccessible. \r\n>\r\n>We do have a workaround through a separate AerialConfig.app, which is a standalone version of this exact configuration panel. It will let you fully configure Aerial. We apologize for this inconvenience.\r\n Is the build not signed ? I was pretty sure I did ?\r\n I can confirm redownloading the app. Weird thing is, it shows as signed (codesign -vd on the app file) ! I'll look into it tomorrow, must be something I missed regarding signing, maybe needs an entitlement or something, bah !\r\n\r\nEdit : The zip needs to be signed too \ud83d\ude31 Will see how to do that tomorrow   @28grahams \r\nPlease make sure you have installed the latest version, this bug has been fixed since 1.4. \r\n\r\nHere's version 1.4.4 : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nYou can read this message if you want more information on how to check your version : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/608#issuecomment-434451106 and the project readme for instructions to uninstall any old version you may have.   @nnichols14  Which folder ? And when do you see the message ?\r\n\r\nDid you try this as written in the troubleshooting section : \r\n\r\n> \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS.\" error: Select Aerial, close System Preferences with Aerial still selected, re-open System Preferences and Aerial should now work. This is a known bug with Swift screensavers in macOS/OS X reported to Apple as rdar://25569037.\r\n  Hi @PencilNotPen \r\n\r\n- Add the ability to have a separate video format on battery : Should be doable, I'll look into it for 1.4.5.\r\n\r\n- Have dark mode independent of time calculations/override : I'm unsure of how to implement that UI wise. I agree that dark mode is a bit different than the other time modes and could be cumulated, but it was quite convenient to put everything at the same level !\r\n\r\nMaybe some checkbox like \"Always show night videos on dark mode\" at the bottom of the pane, with some introductory text. Maybe @SeanMSmith would have an idea of how to phrase that ?\r\n @PencilNotPen check \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.5beta2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nI also added a power saving mode (fully dim brightness + black screen) on battery/low battery.  Hi @ccharlton \r\n\r\nLive desktop is just a series of still pictures, maybe a dozen but can be more, that change throughout the day. So there's not much in common in practice. We do support showing day/night videos based on time (see the Time tab) but we can't force Aerial on the desktop for now. \r\n\r\nIn previous versions of macOS, you could actually run your screensaver as a desktop picture, (see here https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/37) but this is no longer possible on Mojave. We don't know of a workaround to this yet. There might be a way to directly insert ourselves in the background to replace the wallpapers, but I don't know if that's possible yet.  So I looked a bit more into it, it looks like in recent versions of macOS, you can no longer put a window at wallpaper level (behind the desktop icons) but you can still have somthing that's \"on top\" of the wallpaper/desktop icons but behind everything else (dock, menus, all windows)\r\n\r\nI'm considering looking at this further, but would probably release this as a separate app if there's interest.   I confirm ! Thanks will be fixed in next build ! Closing with 1.4.5b2 thanks !\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.5beta2  @pws442 was it just after install ? Did you restart the System Preferences panel after install (as suggested) ? If not does it keep doing it ?\r\n\r\nWhich version of Aerial are you using ? Pretty sure I fixed this in 1.4 on Mojave. Did you use 1.4.4 ? \r\n\r\nYou can see version at the bottom right of the screen : \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 21 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47649972-1f76a980-db7f-11e8-910b-1d5d50931ae2.png)\r\n\r\n If you don't, you probably have a very old version (make sure you don't have 2 aerial versions installed and mix them up, happens to me often too :)) The new version has a \"earth\" thumbnail on the left, whereas the old ones had a Golden Gate thumbnail. No problem, enjoy !  Hi @thomasche, this seems to happen for some (maybe all ? unsure) users of high sierra, I did notice it myself and asked around about it here : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/586\r\n\r\nI'll try to get some more feedback as I'm not sure it's a bug for everyone on 10.13.6 (it's definitely not happening on Mojave). For some reason it lookds like we don't have focus, which makes the textfields unusable (so margins, custom message, brightness time and custom coordinates off the top of my head).\r\n\r\nI currently have no good workaround for this but if you really want to fix something manually, you can edit the preferences .plist easily if you have Xcode to change those settings.\r\n\r\nThe plist can be found here : \r\n\r\n`~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.JohnCoates.Aerial.{UUID}.plist`\r\n\r\nThe parameters should be pretty self explanatory, if you need more help with this workaround just ask ! I'll try to ask some of our other users on 10.13.6. \r\n\r\nEdit:  got another confirmation. Tried looking for a solution today but nothing yet.\r\nEdit 2: Really thought I had it, I did manage to get the controls \"blue\" but the textfields remain uneditable \ud83e\udd2f As a workaround to this bug, starting with 1.4.5 beta 2, I provide an additional download, AerialConfig.app. This app is a standalone version of the Aerial configuration pane that you see in System Preferences. You can use this standalone App to configure Aerial instead of the System Preferences panel if you have issues with it. \r\n\r\nThe file is AerialConfig.app.zip, you'll need to install the same version of the screensaver for things to work smootly. @thomasche can you get both files and give this a try please ?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.5beta2    @KyleLeneau this look pretty awesome, huge work on linting I really appreciate it (this is my first swift project as you would have probably guessed fixing the lints \ud83d\ude05). \r\n\r\nI'll have a thorough look at this today and merge ASAP, many many thanks ! As far as I see, no issues with this so on we go, thanks !  I'm not convinced this is correct. Those were added by @SeanMSmith so we should ask his input. It's one thing to use specific rules for UI but when it's full sentences, there are specific rules. As far as I know, if there's no . before the ( it should be mincapped. Will wait for @SeanMSmith on this but thanks ! Thanks ! Closing this then.   > I would like the option to set a custom amount of time the text stays on the screen for, not just 10 seconds or always\r\n\r\nLet me guess, you want a 5 second option that would look like what's on AppleTV ? \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\nI can see adding a 5 second option. Custom, I'm uneasy about because of the way descriptions work. A video may have several descriptions, spaced by as little as 10 or 15 seconds. That's why I use 10. Adding a custom option where you could set 30 would make little sense as it wouldn't be enforced most of the time. \r\n\r\n> Also @glouel Any way to change it from 60 mins to 1 hour?\r\n> ![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 4 37 18 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47686551-03800180-db99-11e8-8b87-e7eaa977dfcb.png)\r\n> In Brightness\r\n\r\n@NightRaider73 can you please try this for me : \r\n- if you are the last poster on a thread, and unless some time has passed (let's say a day), please edit your previous message and don't reply to yourself, you're generating a HUGE amount of notifications and that's really disturbing. Just edit your message, it's better for everyone\r\n- try to stay relatively on topic, this brightness thing is really unrelated ;) I'll be reworking that one slightly but there's a point to the minutes, so we can later auto fill that in the minutes field below. \r\n\r\nThis would make things easier for me, thanks  @StrangePC ?  (please see my reply here too : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/602#issuecomment-434273341)\r\n\r\nSo yep, Aerial does by default : \r\n- show community descriptions\r\n- show apple descriptions\r\n- show the video name \r\n\r\nIn that case there's neither a community description nor a Apple description (there are very few of these AFAIR). I'll add one for this one thanks. \r\n\r\nIf you see other videos where this is the case, list them here so we can do something about them. Closing with 1.4.5b2:\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.5beta2  Can you make a picture or a screenshot of the bug ? There are some known drivers issues on High Sierra. One thing that seemed to help most users was enabling the clock on this pane : \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 17 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47677201-c3337a00-dbbe-11e8-9c8b-1ed3becd1169.png)\r\n\r\nCheck the \"Show with clock\" at the bottom of the screen and let me know if that helps. As far as we know, this is fixed in Mojave although that may not be of much help to you. \r\n\r\nWe may be able to make a workaround if you seem to think that it happens when the text disappears, by having a . in a corner of the screen maybe, let me know about the clock first please. @cwoloszynski I made a quick build with a small grey dot at the bottom left corner of the screen, maybe that will fix your issue, please try this build : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.5test1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIf it does fix your issue, maybe I can make the dot smaller/fainter (and will make it optional of course as it seems to be a 2017 MBP on High Sierra only thing).  @NightRaider73 this is the first one, but probably will sign everything from now on. If I don't sign the build, the location detection (from the other thread) will silently fail.  @gronkster oh thanks for checking my quick build ! Would you be willing to test another one where I try to make the small dot fainter ? I don't know if full opacity is needed or not. If it's not I can make it really inconspicuous.  @gronkster awesome, this bug has been puzzling me for weeks, cool to see this workaround actually works !\r\n\r\nHere it is :\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.5beta1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThe . should no longer be visible, hopefully it will still do the trick ! Ha, that's quite possible, let me know thanks ! Maybe because the dot is barely visible, it gets optimized out some of the time and it no longer works. (I hope it's not something with the linted stuff that was also in that beta, hopefully) @gronkster I made a less faint dot on this build, if you feel like testing it : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.5beta2 @gronkster thanks for checking so quickly ! There's also now a standalone AerialConfig.app for the other High Sierra issue (textfields). I assume you'll have the same issue as others on High Sierra with this.  I did send them an email earlier today, and they were kind enough to write about the project, pretty cool feature too ;)  Thanks for your report. To be clear, when you say only main monitor, you mean only your Mac display right and not the 2 externals ? I'll have a look ! Ok thanks, just to confirm too, if you use the brightness keys on your Macbook, do all of the screens dim ? \r\n\r\nHere with DVI over DP, external screens don't change brightness either for example. I'm not sure every monitor can have it's brightness controlled over every interface, will look more into it. Yeah we use macOS' system brightness controls, so if they don't work with your monitors, Aerial won't be able to do more. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, you could control external Apple monitors too, but probably not other brands through those system settings. It may depend on the interface used too (maybe the LG 5K monitor supports this ?) @jakecovert , I have added a description of how the brightness dimming works in the readme. I'll keep in mind if I can do something else about this at some point (I noted it here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/projects/1 ), but macOS doesn't seem to help a lot on this. Thanks !   Agreed, will move that for next version Haha yeah I put those in the screenshot to avoid showing my location ;) \r\n\r\nNoted on those, will look at that tomorrow thanks ! I did earlier today, I'll let you know if he responds. Took him a while the first time too so hang in there ;) Closing with 1.4.5b2\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.5beta2  Yeah sorry @oddharsh, if you only want the clock there's one built in with macOS that you can enable in the main pane. \r\n\r\nAerial's clock was implemented to have a clock that doesn't interfere with the descriptions (as MacOS's clock did). Clock and descriptions are tied down in the way they appear and it would be pretty hard to decouple them.   Ha yes ! Need to resize the rectangle, will see if I can fix that thanks for the report ! Side bug, clock was also not showing if you deactivated community descriptions and picked a video where there were no apple provided descriptions. \r\n\r\nFixed in beta 3 : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta3/Aerial.saver.zip  Awesome, thanks !  Yeah I have no idea how those work, will have a look at some point. afaik this is how it works, so closing this.   Yep, I do, will put that in next thanks ! The master thing is done for brightness and text. I'll look into the coordinate stuff at some point. \r\n\r\n(and yes for screenshot @ 1.4.4 finale) > Also when you delete your coordinates it doesn't recalculate them for you, maybe add a recalculate coordinates option.\r\n\r\nIt does as soon as you validate the field (enter, leave, etc), I don't see the problem. If one field is empty it will prompt you to fix it.  Fixed in beta 3 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta3/Aerial.saver.zip  Yeah, it's still easier and people that use package manager are used to that kind of thing, I have a version check branch somewhere but not ready (and will not auto update but will let you know when an update is here). Thanks !  I've seen a weird bug on my old Macbook Air that's stuck on 10.13.6. When you open Aerial preferences, the preferences sheet doesn't have focus. The biggest hint is that the tab bar is grey instead of blue (in focus) : \r\n\r\n![bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47573866-a0932e00-d93e-11e8-959a-a70bc25ec4e4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis used to be of little impact in older versions, but with more recent ones, apart from the color thing, you simply can't type in any text field, which is an issue for custom messages, brightness duration and longitude/latitude.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else experience this on any version of macOS prior to Mojave or is it just on my system ? I've rolled back to 1.2 and the issue was already there, I tried a few things to fix it but no luck. Interesting, hopefully we'll get more data on this ! Thanks for confirmation. Been trying to look onto that one all day with no success so far. I did find one swift screensaver that doesn't have the issue, it doesn't do anything different from what I can see (the project is old swift and I need an old Xcode to try and compile it again, will look into that) So I tried a lot of stuff, even managed to get the buttons and everything get tinted, but the fields remain uneditable on High Sierra. At that point I'm thinking of a plan B, we have a separate AerialApp which is just a test app for developers, but allow you to change the settings, and it works perfectly on high sierra. \r\n\r\nSo I'll just release the AerialApp as a separate optional download for High Sierra, and people can use that as a workaround to change Aerial settings. I think it's a good enough compromise as I spent a couple of days on this already for nothing.  Please see here for the workaround : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/606#issuecomment-434813082  There's no need to reopen a new issue, I get notifications for messages on closed issues and reply there. And no I can't do better than that, I suggest you read the other thread.  @StrangePC Define anywhere ? As of right now you can use random corner if you don't want it to stick always at the same place. @StrangePC As far as I know it's in the left bottom corner on Apple TV ? \r\n\r\nRandom position is not easy. I do, but we don't aim to copy *exactly* everything Apple does. They may, and rightly so, take offense to it. We're quite happy that they haven't so far.\r\n\r\nAdding a custom fixed position could be done, I'll put it in the list of future features to be looked at.  Trying not to break everything, one \"easy\" option would be to allow to change the margin relative to the corner, this way it doesn't break the rest of the features. I'll keep thinking about it. @StrangePC \r\n\r\nAdded the option to change the margin in beta2. Also change the default to 50/50px instead of 10/10. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta2/Aerial.saver.zip Closing as fixed.   Please remove your changes to the auto update. Thanks!  Haha nice catch ! Indeed that's the Eiffel Tower coordinates, those were my test coordinates, forgot to remove them as I rushed that build to fix the translation crash :) I'll leave these blank with a placeholder in next build ! @dVIAN13 I put up 1.4.4 beta 1, I removed the default values for latitude longitudes (they will remain if you installed test2 though, just empty the fields) and added a number formatter that should keep inputs correct. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta1/Aerial.saver.zip  No worries !\r\n\r\n- I think they use a slightly different calculation, not a coordinates issues, that may differ a bit. I use this to calculate https://github.com/ceek/solar\r\n\r\nHere, I get about a +/- 7 min difference with night shift indeed, using the \"official\" calculation mode. There are several ways to calculate (I was pondering adding them), but Apple is a bit between official and \"civil\" calculation (closer to official).\r\n\r\nSee this : https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea, civil is -/+40 compared to \"official\" here. My guess is Apple is using official + 1\u00b0 or something like that. I'm not sure if \"copying\" their stuff is a good idea, although I understand the discrepancy can be troubling. Maybe I can explain it better with the multiple calculation modes (and maybe add a mode that gets close to night shift would solve the thing, as an option with civil and regular, etc).\r\n\r\n- In theory you can get coordinates through location services. This has a few issues though, the first one being I didn't manage to get it to work in my early testing \ud83d\ude05 But even then, one issue is you may get a prompt which can be an issue as I need to be able to rely on Aerial starting with no UI when the screensaver launches itself. I can't prompt there, and there can be reasons why you may need to get reprompted (maybe you disabled location services or something and I need to ask permission again). That's why I went with night shift, it's much easier, there's no permissions and it fixes itself if you travel. It's probably possible to implement something robust for the other mode with CoreLocation but that's probably more work than I wish to  undertake right now as the permission thing is not easy to fix I think, especially since it's a fallback solution for older macs.\r\n\r\n- Arg, that one is my fault \ud83d\ude48 It's the thing that make sure you don't put letters in that does that, I'll fix it in next version ;) @dVIAN13 so according to these guys : https://www.timeanddate.com\r\n\r\nThe \"official\" mode that the library I used give are the \"correct\" times (modulo a few seconds). The library uses 90.83 degrees to calculate that value (per \r\nhttps://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html). If I use 90\u00b0, I get pretty much exactly the values from night shift, so it looks like Apple rounded that value :)\r\n\r\nWhat I did for beta 2 is put a new menu right of the lat/long to pick the calculation mode with these values: \r\n- Strict (0\u00b0)\r\n- Official (0.83\u00b0)\r\n- Civil (6\u00b0)\r\n- Nautical (12\u00b0)\r\n- Astronomical (18\u00b0)\r\n\r\nStrict is the Apple like one, I'll keep Official as default, and add a help bubble describing the values. beta 2 : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta2/Aerial.saver.zip Yep it's about 7 mins diff here between official and strict,  but strict is about even to night shift, that's why I put it there. \r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer Civil so far but I think it's gonna be season dependent !\r\n\r\nYou can look here https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/580#issuecomment-433134834 about the difficulty to get user coordinates, in theory it's easy but bit of a mess with permissions. Maybe some day I'll get to it. \r\n\r\nIt's fairly easy to input them from maps as a user (well, it's a bit of a mess, you need to right click your location, send to mail, then extract coordinates from the link that's in mail \ud83d\ude31). It's much easier from other sources, or maybe some geocoding (input your location, get coordinates). I may look at that one as an easy cope-out ;)\r\n\r\nGetting user location programmatically afaik requires permission which is messy (but very good from a user stand point, just messy for our very specific usage). > @glouel So does it give you the correct coordinates?\r\n> Or do you have to get them from maps?\r\n\r\nI don't get your question. This is a manual option for now yes, where you have to enter your coordinates yourself. It's a fallback mode for those who don't have nightshift. \r\n\r\n> Perhaps (for the future) a button in Aerial's Time pane to \"Get current coordinates\", so that any permissions dialog will appear only when the user has manually requested the current coordinates.\r\n\r\nYep that's what I'm looking at. CoreLocation on MacOS is a bit weird though, we'll see where I get with this. Ideally a button to get once and only once, and a checkbox for \"try to check\" that would try to get location when the screensaver starts for those that move around with their macs.\r\n\r\n @SeanMSmith & @dVIAN13 \r\n\r\nAfter looking for pretty much everything, and finding a way to make it work on Mojave only, it's just that using location services on MacOS **requires** that the app/plugin is signed. This isn't documented as far as I know and kept me looking everywhere (and finding that \"workaround\" on Mojave which I don't use). So in beta 4 I've added a small button next to lat/long : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-28 a 16 12 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47617869-53dd5d80-dacc-11e8-9484-3b2d9495270b.png)\r\n\r\nIt will autofill for you based on your coordinates after asking for permission (probably once per build as far as I see). Can you let me know if that works for you? This should work on anything macOS > 10.6\r\n\r\nIf that works well, I might move that option up above night shift in the dialog, as I  think it's better for most people to be able to calculate using your favorite method. \r\n\r\nbeta 4 : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta4/Aerial.saver.zip @SeanMSmith I probably wasn't clear, but with a signed build this should work on anything > 10.6. I don't use the Mojave only workaround, but the builds absolutely need to be signed for it to work (beta 4 is signed so should be ok for you, works on my MBA on 10.13.6 here). Will fix tomorrow thanks! > Getting my current coordinates works well in High Sierra (and the coordinates are very close to those shown in Apple Maps - they diverge at the fourth decimal place, which is close enough). \r\n\r\nGood ! Core Location gets pretty close usually, it's really good (considering the lack of GPS on Macs)\r\n\r\n> 1. Change \"Today's\" to \"Today\u2019s\" (i.e. use a proper apostrophe)\r\n\r\nIs that the default apostrophe on QWERTY keyboard ?\r\n\r\n> 2. Don't capitalize \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\"\r\n> 3. More importantly, when the user has chosen to calculate from Civil, Nautical, or Astronomical, then change \"Today\u2019s sunrise\" to \"Today\u2019s dawn\" and change \"Today\u2019s sunset\" to \"Today\u2019s dusk\".\r\n\r\nOk.\r\n\r\n> The help text should probably also be changed to make clear that Civil, Nautical, and Astronomical are ways of calculating the time of dawn and of dusk, not of sunrise and sunset. Perhaps something like the following:\r\n> \r\n> There are two ways to calculate the sunset and sunrise time:\r\n> \r\n> * Strict (0\u00b0): Calculate when the center of the Sun crosses the horizon\r\n> * Official (0.83\u00b0) : Calculate when the Sun completely crosses the horizon\r\n> \r\n> Or instead of sunrise and sunset, you can pick from three options for the time of dawn and dusk:\r\n> \r\n> * Civil (6\u00b0) : Calculate when the natural sunlight stops/starts requiring artificial light compensation\r\n> * Nautical (12\u00b0) : Calculate when stars stop/start being seen\r\n> * Astronomical (18\u00b0) : Calculate the point when the sun no longer interferes with astronomical observations\r\n> \r\n> (Note also that I have suggested swapping \"start/stop\" for \"stop/start\" in the help text above to correspond with dawn/dusk, adding \"center of\" to the definition of Strict, and correcting the spelling of \"interfere\".)\r\n\r\nAdded as is, thanks ! I also moved up coordinate mode on top of the panel as the preferred method. \r\n \r\n![aerial144](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47652847-58b31780-db87-11e8-9b72-c65a2686d7a3.jpg)\r\n(sorry for the spam, using this for the new screenshots)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 17 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47649971-1f76a980-db7f-11e8-97be-d1f90b943c9d.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 21 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47649972-1f76a980-db7f-11e8-910b-1d5d50931ae2.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 24 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47649973-1f76a980-db7f-11e8-8aef-301307d48fa2.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 24 46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47649974-1f76a980-db7f-11e8-8339-3f0424652b8c.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 13 25 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47649975-200f4000-db7f-11e8-9e8b-f75c4a5ebde4.png)\r\n > > > 1.

See here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/586\r\n\r\nMany thanks !\r\n\r\nAnd if you have another second, a quick look at this too : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/603  Interesting thanks !\r\n\r\nCouple of questions : \r\n- Is community descriptions checked in Text panel ?\r\n- Did you enable translations, and if so which language ?\r\n\r\nBoth crashed at playing b8-3.mov for some reason, which is the San Francisco / Alamo Square video. I tried playing this one in a loop here just in case but nothing. That's why I'm asking about translation, could be something there. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can probably uncheck that video from your playlist. > Yes community descriptions is checked in Text panel.\r\n> Yes I enabled translations, preferred language is French (my system default language).\r\n\r\nDiantre !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Another crash (b8-3.mov involved again) :\r\n> Aerial 1.4.4test1, macOS 10.14, iMac 16 GB, single monitor setup.\r\n> Was not preview, crashed during screensaver playback.\r\n> \r\n> Do you want log+crashlog ?\r\n\r\nNo need just reproduced with just b8-3 selected and french, will check what I did wrong there  Ok found it, it was a community/translation mixup. Fixed in \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4test2/Aerial.saver.zip That should have fixed that crash but probably reintroduced a rare (non crashing) issue in previews, I think I figured out why, I'll keep at it and if I'm right I'll put up a beta with the fix later today.\r\nEdit : Actually no, this is about your other crash, I'm mixing them up but they are related :) The fix for b8-3 is ok ;) Closing as fixed in 1.4.4b1 \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta1/Aerial.saver.zip  Any context around this one ? Do you have a multi monitor setup ? Was it preview, did it crash during playback, at the end of a video, etc ? Ok thanks. It just played one video and crashed I think. I'll have a look. \r\n\r\nEdit : nope, crashed at the end of the second one.  So this one I kinda got, although it's still weird. Your other crash may be linked but hard to tell.  \r\n\r\nIf you feel like testing, give this build a shot : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4test1/Aerial.saver.zip As I said mistakenly in the other thread :\r\nThat should have fixed that crash but probably reintroduced a rare (non crashing) issue in previews, I think I figured out why, I'll keep at it and if I'm right I'll put up a beta with the fix later today. Found the core reason as I said for this bug, tested it all day, all good now. Fix is in public beta here : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nFeel free to reopen if you still experience an issue  Ok! Always important to test stuff :)  \ud83d\udc4d   Thanks for the readme, the cask should get updated later today. \r\n\r\nAs for the changes, nope on macOS (we keep the brand as is, nope on corner either (on macOS conventions radio buttons are First word cap only. Yep on current, I'll fix on next version thanks  Reproduced, thanks for your report, will look into it ! Fixed in 1.4.3, there was also a retain cycle when streaming videos. Those were some pretty old bugs but now that we have many more videos it made things much worse !\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.3/Aerial.saver.zip Quite possible on streaming yep ! Anything cached was fine thankfully.   @dvtch I can't find much about what is precisely not allowed at login, but I can think of a couple reasons why it wouldn't work. \r\n\r\nThe very first launch of Aerial needs : \r\n- network access to download the json\r\n- to create a cache directory (in the users Library/Cache)\r\n- filesystem access to said directory \r\n- to write where the cache directory is in the user's preferences. \r\n\r\nSo pre login, first launch would definitely fail. \r\nSubsequent launch, I would guess when no user is login, you can't load preferences so we'd don't know where to look for the cache directory, assuming we would have access to the filesystem (I would guess not).\r\n\r\nSo off the top of my head, I would guess that's not possible as is. If you can find what specifically is allowed/not allowed, maybe we could find a workaround but it would make sense to me that we don't have filesystem access at login.\r\n\r\nLast comment [there](http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/07/set-screen-saver-login-window-mac-os-x/), people seem to say that Ken Burns won't load, which would corroborate the no filesystem thing. (I would add to this that installing for all users should do most of this for you already, but I'm really not convinced filesystem would be available to Aerial, for security reasons. Might be totally wrong on that ! If you give it a shot, enable logging and post log if you have an issue)  Make sense ! Thanks @LvanProosdij for clarification.  > What do you mean by _\"installing for all users\"_ ? By default macOS \"install screen savers for all users\". When you double click `Aerial.saver` file after uncompressing the downloaded archive, macOS does automatically store `Aerial.saver` in `/Library/Screen Savers/`\r\n\r\nPretty sure that's no longer the default, here it defaults to current user only when installing a screensaver on Mojave. You can override at install though.\r\n\r\n> What do you mean by \"should do most of this for you already\" ? Locating prefs and caches is hard coded in developers code. **Currently even if Aerial is located in `/Library/Screen Savers/` it does store it's prefs in users `~Library/Preferences/ByHost/`**\r\n\r\nCache can be overridden manually. But that's what I meant by \"most\", yes. I didn't write the Preferences code so I'm not sure if it tries to use global preferences. If not it will fail but that's fixable.  According to code, Aerial uses [ScreenSaverDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/screensaver/screensaverdefaults) which wraps userDefaults\r\n\r\nUsing global preferences requires usage of the low level [CFPreferences](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/preferences_utilities)\r\n\r\nThere may be some permission issue (or not, hard to tell) since we are running as a plugin to either ScreenSaverEngine or SystemPreferences (which is why Apple provides the ScreenSaverDefaults wrapper). Probably not a trivial change but if you want to explore this we definitely welcome PRs.  Even without SIP ? Wow ! Well, thanks a lot for checking this @LvanProosdij ! Indeed ! I'll put a line about it on the readme for future reference.   dupe-ish of https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/532\r\n\r\nBetter cache management is coming in a future update. \r\n\r\nCheck this comment https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/532#issuecomment-429456503 and below about what we'll do about it.   I think that's just the 1080p video getting downscaled that artifacts like that, although it does look particularly bad. Is that on a retina screen ?\r\n\r\nOn 4K videos I noticed the opposite, where the previews are extra sharp and small details tend to blink. I'll have a look tomorrow, I'm not sure if we can pick any resizing method (usually you can) for previews.  Oh sorry lol. It definitely needs updating, I'll check tomorrow thanks ! Updated (and changed the pic for a more dramatic one), there's now a retina pic too : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-23 a 10 25 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47346796-2fd5e280-d6ae-11e8-9cb3-4d7e19202d24.png)\r\n\r\nWill be in 1.4.2 final.

The retina thing, no workaround yet though so I'll leave it as is but doesn't look like we can do anything about this one. @dVIAN13 here's the build with the new icon with rounded corners, I tried to align myself to word of the day although the other ones are slightly different. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAlso couple of new featuer, manual sunset/sunrise calculation from latitude/longitude, and brightness reduction !

Ha yes, I removed the old \"Download now\" to put in the stop button and thus I send back to the video panel. \r\n\r\nI guess something happens when the list refresh itself to add the queue/download indicators. Maybe there's the same thing when you use the menu below, I'll try to have a look thanks ! > thanks!, not that it's a bug necessarily, however, if you're on the main panel(videos), and it's displaying a preview, if you then go to cache and click 'download now', it jumps back to main screen, but the display is then black. This is the case whether of not there are downloads available. I can open up a new issue if you'd like..\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure I reproduced the issue yesterday but I can't this morning, hmm ! Whether from the menu or from the Download now button, it keeps playing, whether I have a 4K or a 1080p video selected. I'm pretty sure I didn't fix it though. Will keep an eye on it. Marking as fixed in 1.4.2.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2/Aerial.saver.zip  @dennisN75 Per the [troubleshooting section](\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial#troubleshooting), this is a bug in your macOS version, there's a workaround though: \r\n\r\n> \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS.\" error: Select Aerial, close System Preferences with Aerial still selected, re-open System Preferences and Aerial should now work. This is a known bug with Swift screensavers in macOS/OS X reported to Apple as rdar://25569037.\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by Apple in later 10.3.X releases. Yeah I figured it was 10.*13*.3. \r\n\r\nI'd highly suggest you update to .4 or .6, it's a macOS bug with Swift screensavers, nothing we can do about that one. There were many issues at the time of their release, it looks like it started getting fixed in 10.13.4. It's definitely fixed in 10.13.6. This also happened on Mojave beta (thankfully fixed there too). \r\n\r\nSee this issue here for example : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/377\r\n\r\nEnabling the clock (at the bottom of the System Preferences) was another workaround around that time, worth a shot although I think it was another bug. Try enabling the clock first, but yes you should defintely consider updating. Ok was worth a shot ! Sorry about that, OS update will fix this for you.  Closing this, please reopen if you still have an issue.  Looks like I broke something, sorry about that. Were you using mirroring mode ? Do the other two modes still work ? I'll try to have a look tomorrow. \r\n\r\n That makes sense in a way, I may have broken that mode while fixing mirrored. Again, sorry I'll fix tomorrow ! @luckman212 So in my haste to squash that nasty mirroring mode I did mess everything else up \ud83d\ude05 I did recheck every cases (previews, non previews) on two multimonitor setups (one Mojave, one 10.13.6).\r\n\r\nThis time (...) it should really be fine, I'll post beta4 as soon as GitHub let me do so (maybe a couple hours according to their status...) @luckman212 : Fixed everything in beta 4, again sorry about that one ! \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta4/Aerial.saver.zip  @luckman212 Thanks again for your report, and checking the fix so quickly too \ud83d\udc4d  Marking as fixed in https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2/Aerial.saver.zip  What's the error message ? Something that can happen on recent Macs is that in order for night shift to detect sunset/sunrise time, you need to have location services enabled. It should tell you so in the grey area. \r\n\r\nCan you check for that ? \r\n\r\nAnother way to check is to go to terminal and run `/usr/bin/corebrightnessdiag nightshift-internal`\r\n\r\nMore information about this here https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/528\r\n\r\n  It should have appeared in the UI in the grey line where you see the sunset/sunrise times right now, are you sure it wasn't there ? Good anyway that this is fixed ! I may add a warning icon to point to them in case of error. Thanks !  1) is messy, especially taking into account right aligned options where it just shift the issue to minutes:hours\r\n2) it is then\r\n\r\nYou can also use a monospaced font if that really bothers you and you want seconds. That's what Apple does with it's screensaver clock and the way it should be. I've added 2) in next version AND put a monospaced font for clock as default.  @fcpwiz This is fixed in beta2 per above : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta2/Aerial.saver.zip @fcpwiz \r\nNote that this is actually bugged in public beta, this build here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta5/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nfixes the issue that was reported here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/568\r\n\r\nIf all goes well I'll push stable 1.4.2 later today which will have the fix too.   @NightRaider73 \r\nMost of this was outdated/duplicated so I simplified the format pointing to the relevant troubleshooting stuff. Can you have one more look at the chances before I merge this ? Thanks !\r\n\r\nI was inspired by https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE \r\n\r\nI kinda like what they do, helps triage stuff :) Many thanks !  \ud83d\udc4d Thanks ! I don't think I can do that, I'll double check. I know it's a bit of a pain to use PRs but I'm very thankful for your help on this !  Well, if you'd like some help, maybe try to be nice and elaborate a bit about your issue ? \r\n\r\n- What happens if you close and reopen System Preferences, go to Screensaver and select Aerial on the left, do you see a mini preview streaming ? \r\n- If you open Aerial preferences and click a video on the list on the left, does it start playing or not ? \r\n- Have you tried downloading a video (clicking the + button next to a video) to cache it ? Does that work ?\r\n\r\nCaching videos in general helps on older versions of MacOS. Yes, the \"preview button\" is broken on 1.4.1...\r\n\r\nThere's an issue posted about exactly this here with the explanation and fix : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/548 Closing as fixed in 1.4.2 beta 1 https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.2beta1 I don't see your pictures. Have you restarted System Preferences after upgrading ? This is a macOS bug that we can't fix with Swift screensavers, it messes the UI on first start just after upgrading if System Preferences was loaded.  That's definitely not 1.4.2 ! This looks like the old 1.2 version from years ago. Are you sure you downloaded the right one ? \r\n\r\nTry this link : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta1/Aerial.saver.zip You have to use the zip I linked, this is no good, I'll see to remove it. Make sure you have removed the old one and restarted syspref. If that's still an issue, feel free to reopen with more information about your setup : \r\n- Mac model\r\n- mac OS version\r\n- Screen resolution (and retina)\r\n\r\nThere's also a new debug mode in Advanced, you can enable it and enable log to disk, and run the screensaver once (don't use preview, run the screensaver normally) and post the file there so I can have a look at it tomorrow.   More bugs were fixed specifically in multi monitor setups + mirrored mode in b3 : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta3/Aerial.saver.zip  \ud83d\udc4d merging, thanks !  Duplicate of \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/370\r\n\r\nIt's coming soon.  Closing as duplicate  Sticky... Well, people keep complaining that they don't want stuff to stay at the same place to avoid burn-in \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\nHaving the clock on a longer schedule, that's definitely doable though, it can definitely be jarring when you have 10s in a transition. \r\n\r\nReason why it moves this way right now is that I linked it to the position of the extra information. (same, h-opposed, d-opposed), I'll try to think about that one.\r\n > By the way, I should have thought that \"horizontally opposed\" meant \"across, on the other side of the screen, on the same level horizontally\" not \"above or below\".\r\n\r\nI tried to take the mathematical approach but maybe that doesn't translate well ! So back to main subject, what if it sticks to the corner you asked IF you set a static corner in the text pane for descriptions, and pick one of the opposed thing ? Having it stick on \"same\" will be an issue, I can \"animate it\" to it's new position which depends on the text description below it (the line height may differ based on letters, and if you pick a truly large font, it may split to multiple lines ?\r\n\r\nAnd if you pick random, animate as it is right now ? \r\n\r\nDoes that sound like a good compromise ? Yes, sorry if I wasn't clear. \r\n\r\nIf you go to the Text panel, you can pick the corner where descriptions should appear, right ? You have 5 options, one for each corner, and random (which moves them around)\r\n\r\nOn top of that just below, you can ask the clock to stay above the text, or be horizontally opposite (so in your screenshot, would appear on top left corner) or diagonally opposite (so top right corner your case).\r\n\r\n- If you pick random corner, I keep it as it is. \r\n\r\n- If you pick one of the 4 corners (as you did, and not random) AND pick either horizontally or diagonnally opposite (which you didn't) for clock, then I could make it stick, no problem.\r\n\r\n- If you pick one of the 4 corners (as you did), AND you pick the \"same\" corner for clock (as you did), then I can make it stick but would have to animate it by a few pixels (not fade but move it around) as the clock position depends on the size of the text below. Depending on font size, screen size and text length, the text can be split into multiple lines so I would have to account for that and \"move\" the clock up/down to compensate. It may move by a couple pixels from text to text depending on the letters/font you picked too. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense ?  > Ah yes, that makes sense. I have to ask though: Font size and Screen size are constant for each session at least and only text length is variable, correct? \r\n\r\nIn 99% of cases yes. But I have to account for all, there are some cases where some letters in each font may not have the same height (think fancy capital letters for example). So in that event, I would have to shift the clock accordingly. In most case it might just be moving it (not fading it) 2/3 pixels up/down animated over a second which should be pretty imperceptible.\r\n\r\n> * making the info text denser, if it would exceed one line\r\n> * clipping the info text, if it would exceed one line\r\n> * always reserving space for two lines of info text (okay, this may cause problems on really small displays or large font settings)\r\n\r\nSee above, wouldn't fix the issue, I can't predict accurately height over time. I think it's a pretty non issue, I'll get back to you with a build, you'll see and let me know. \r\n @bennokress check this version : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test8/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nWith helvetica neue it shouldn't move by a pixel ;) Yeah that was a quick fix ;)\r\n\r\nYou can try a large font and see how it moves if it multi lines split to see the move effect. And random mode for corner (in that case you should see the old fades). \r\n\r\nI think those are decent defaults, we'll see what people think. Oh that's a good catch, forgot that case. Agreed, in that case it should fade ! Will fix in next build thanks !

I'm still unsure what will go there, maybe version check too. I'll try to make it clearer that it's for testing purposes thanks :) \r\n\r\nThanks for all this, will be in next build  I did rush the readme a bit :D It definitely does help, thanks !   Hi, see my comment here for more details : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/545#issuecomment-430401262\r\n\r\nThe issue is, Aerial is a plugin to System Preferences from a technical point of view, not a proper app, so I don't think that the plugin can update itself. I'm looking at version checks for upcoming version as a workaround.\r\n\r\nThe best way to get auto updates right now, as mentionned in the project readme, is to use brew cask ! See : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial#brew-cask-support---updated-for-version-141 > If you installed Brew Cask, is there a way to run the 'brew cask reinstall aerial' command from Automator? I can't seem to get it to work.\r\n\r\nYou should run `brew cask upgrade` to update Aerial (and other outdated apps). You can look for \"shell script\" in automator I think (I don't use automator much sorry, maybe someone else can help). Awesome thanks !\r\n\r\nLinking.  I've seen a blank preview (before entering Aerial proper) a couple of times, that's probably linked to that. I'll have a look thanks ! Are you mirroring to multi monitors for the record ? Might be some changes I made for Main display only, maybe mirror (which was the default) always work. Thanks I'll have a look. This may not be the one I saw. \r\n\r\nWhat I saw was if you open Syspref, go to screensaver, video start in the little preview thing. Click the desktop tab, then go back to screensaver, the \"mini preview\" is black. Clicking the \"preview\" button when black will still play correctly fullscreen though. This is with \"Main display only\", but no external display connected.\r\n\r\nAccording to logs, the preview don't seem to be reloaded when I do that (maybe video is paused ?). Clicking another screensaver then back will get the thing reloaded. I'll try to see with external monitor. I found why that happens, although quite crazily I can only reproduce it on my MBA on 10.13.6. For some reason, only on that machine it reuses the same AerialView than the mini preview for the large preview. But not on my iMac on Mojave. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to pull the threads on all this, bit of cleanup, I might break things \ud83d\ude31 It's a bit of a mess but I think I got something somewhat sane now. Also with proper retina detection (it would probably be pixelated if retina was not main), better start sync, I did see a mess on my MBA if I let the preview play to the end, still need to track that, but otherwise should be better : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test4/Aerial.saver.zip \r\n\r\nIt also fixes the bug I saw (I think completely...) of going out and back in of screensaver with the mini preview being black.  Awesome thanks, I'll keep this open until I get 1.4.2 out.  Oh yes that's very possible I break that I'll have a look, thanks ! > In 1.4.2 test 7, I'm now noticing that the full-screen preview plays the **_first_** time I click the Preview button, but not the second or subsequent times. (I don't know if this is a change in behavior from test 6, or if I just didn't test test 6 adequately.)\r\n\r\nJust double checked it's fixed in b1 Addendum, this WASNT fully saved in b1. \r\n\r\nOn some systems, if you have a \"minipreview\" in syspref and press \"preview\" (to get the fullscreen one), ScreenSaverEngine will reuse the same instance of Aerial than the one used for the minipreview (which we really don't want).\r\n\r\nBecause of this, in multi-monitor setup with mirroring mode only (!), it worked exactly once, but if you pressed preview again, Aerial  would try and reuse a player from the previous time you pressed the preview button, which would crash. \r\n\r\nThis is truly fixed in upcoming b2. Edit : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta2/Aerial.saver.zip  Wow thanks ! I'll have a look at these. \r\n\r\nThe names will be an easy change (I may need to make the list larger again though).\r\n\r\nThe descriptions, those were 100% provided by apple and are translated. So might be a bit tricky to handle adding new points (replacing easy enough) for just one language but should be doable. I'll have a look in a coffee or two, thanks ! Side note, I can extract all the POIs if you want to see them in english for all videos ? (poi = time:descriptions) There you go, hopefully readable enough (macOS 10.14.1 beta 4 just broke Sublime Text and somehow rehid file extensions here !)\r\n\r\n[AerialPois.txt](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/files/2491123/AerialPois.txt)\r\n Ok right now I'm starting to merge your new names. However about this : \r\n\r\n> **Movie:** b4-3.mov\r\n> **Name:** Golden Gate from SF\r\n> **Descriptions:** Three descriptions appear far too early.\r\n\r\n> **Movie:** b10-3.mov\r\n> **Name:** Change \"Presidio to Golden Gate\" to \"Marin Headlands to Golden Gate\"\r\n> **Descriptions:** Lost in the fog, these descriptions are going the wrong way!\r\n\r\nOne problem I have is that I may not have the right video ID for these, so these may be totally wrong descriptions. There are 4 Golden Gate videos and 4 matching sets of descriptions  (the _0, _150 is the time stamp, so show at 0, show at 150...): \r\n\r\nA008_C007_0\t: Over the Marin\u00a0Headlands looking toward the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\r\nA008_C007_150 : Crossing the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge toward the Presidio of San\u00a0Francisco\r\n\r\nA013_C005_0 : Moving along the Presidio of San\u00a0Francisco toward the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\r\nA013_C005_190 : Crossing the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge toward the Marin\u00a0Headlands\r\n\r\nA006_C003_0 : San\u00a0Francisco Bay and the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\r\nA006_C003_90 : Heading over the north tower of the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge toward San\u00a0Francisco\r\n\r\nA013_C012_0 : Approaching the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge from San\u00a0Francisco\r\nA013_C012_60 : Alongside the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge heading toward the Marin\u00a0Headlands\r\nA013_C012_140 : Crossing over the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\r\nA013_C012_230 : Passing by the North\u00a0Tower of the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\r\nA013_C012_240 : Over San\u00a0Francisco Bay traveling alongside the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\r\n\r\nI matched : \r\n        \"b8-2\":\"A008_C007_\",                                                // San Francisco day 1\r\n        \"b10-3\":\"A013_C005_\",                                               // San Francisco day 2\r\n        \"b9-3\":\"A006_C003_\",                                                // San Francisco day 3\r\n        \"b4-3\":\"A013_C012_\",                                                // San Francisco day 6\r\n \r\nMaybe I got the order wrong ? Or one of these is for a yet unreleased video. SF is the only one I had a lot of issues with, I think I ended up matching A013_C012 with SF day 6 mostly because it fit on video length. There's also another Embarcadero/market street that's unlinked to any video we have : \r\n\r\nA013_C004_0 : Over the San\u00a0Francisco Bay moving toward the Embarcadero\r\nA013_C004_90 : Over the Embarcadero looking down Market\u00a0Street in San\u00a0Francisco\r\nA013_C004_150 : Following Market\u00a0Street through downtown San\u00a0Francisco\r\nA013_C004_360 : Following Market\u00a0Street through San\u00a0Francisco\r\n\r\nI marked this one as an alternate of SF day 5.\r\n\r\n(and to be clear, I tried to find those videos but I haven't found them on Apple's server. My guess is they will come back at some point since they took the time to label them, yet those aren't in the JSONs. But they are very likely to come back as 4K !) Misc stuff about names mostly (I'll come back to descriptions as a second pass) : \r\n\r\n> _50s:_ Add \"Former Bank of America headquarters blotting out the sun\" (Those familiar with Bank of America's role in the recent US housing crisis will appreciate the aptness of this description.)\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\n> **Name:** Change \"LAX\" to \"Los Angeles Int\u2019l Airport\" (or spell out \"International\" if you have room; \"LAX\" is also used for LA's Union Station, miles from the airport)\r\n\r\nWell, regarding length I'm adding the long versions right now and will make a build. Part of the reason I went with / sometimes was so they would fit in the UI. We'll have to see how we handle the longer ones, I had already made the font smaller and the list larger, but some widgets (donwload/4K) take space too. \r\n\r\n> **Name:** Suggestion: Change \"Hollywood Sign\" to \"Hollywood Hills\" (I'm still trying to wrap my brain around a description - which is a kind of sign - for a sign. Why not just describe the \"Hollywood Hills\" and let the famous sign speak for itself?)\r\n\r\nI like Hollywood Hills !\r\n\r\nAgain, many thanks for this, I'll put up a build with your new names later today so you can see the impact in the UI. > Also under Downtown it just shows \"San Fransisco\" I don't know why but it is the only one.\r\n> I am almost certain that it was fine in 1.4.1 so maybe check that. (I am running 1.4.2test3)\r\n\r\nNope, it was that way too before. That video is the only one (I think out of 66) for which I didn't find \"extra descriptions\" in the strings file, so those are empty and it just shows the video. Maybe I missed them in the strings bundle, it's a bit of a mess !\r\n\r\nThose strings are in the TVIdle bundle in ressources, it's a directory, you can open the english translation more easily by renaming the .strings to .plist so it opens in Xcode (.strings may open or not, it didn't for me, it was just garbled binary somehow, .plist fixed it).  I'm putting my last test build here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIt only includes the name changes, not the descriptions. Some are cut because too long.  Everything helps ! Testing is also super helpful considering the vast variety of configurations out there. Slowly but surely it's getting there ! > @glouel Would it be a hard ask to have the cut-off names in the list display a hovering tool-tip? That way, depending on the sys pref settings for sidebar text (which are still too long for me at small), I would think that a hovering tool-tip could help complete the rest of the name.\r\n\r\nYeah I left them cut off so @SeanMSmith could see what we can work with. Tooltips should very much be doable if we stay with longer lines !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> @glouel I can go through later and correct all of your spelling if you want me to :)\r\n\r\nIf you see stuff either in the UI or in the readme, sure ! I think the UI should be mostly fine (maybe not the newer stuff like Text panel, etc).\r\n\r\nThe extra descriptions are Apple's though so don't spend time double checking those ! @dVIAN13 \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test5/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nwith tooltips... that blink ?! That's what I got enabling tooltips. I guess they do that to not obscure the rest of the UI. That feels so unApple to me but hey... > I didn't realize that the extended descriptions in the older videos were also written by Apple. Frankly, I think they're rather poor, so in case you should decide to undertake the work of improving them, I'll continue to suggest corrections and improvements. :-)\r\n\r\nI think I definitely can use yours (more points, better etc), but for english only. Since you are adding timepoints I'll need to scrape theirs (you seem to have put add/change/remove so that should be an easy enough mix). \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure their strings are copyrighted so to my mind, replacing is fine, keeping some of their olds and your news together in the same video, probably slightly iffy ? In order to try and not anger anyone (that project walks a fine line legally), I would suggest adding a checkbox for \"supplementary/alternate english descriptions\" (something that sounds better and convey those are not Apple's, a help box next to it with some disclaimer text may be needed) that would enable yours for the videos for which you have provided them. Does that sound alright to you ? \r\n\r\nI would highly suggest trying to keep a 10 to 15s minimum between POIs so they are not too jarring and unreadable (I think you pretty much stick to that, there's a 1s delay on your insertion point [I can probably reduce it a bit], and the fades both ways, that can cut half the time although still readable during some of the fade). That's super nice of you thanks ! Take your time, no hurry \ud83d\ude00\r\n\r\nI'll work on the preparatory stuff for it. At some point we may even do translations of those  \"community\" strings (slightly overused word but you see what I mean). I can translate those in french for example. Thanks again for the work you've put into this !\r\n\r\n(I'll start implementing that with \"Alamo Square\" which has no conflict)  > Regarding the two Golden Gate Bridge videos with the whacked-out descriptions:\r\n> \r\n> A013_C005 should instead go with b4-3.mov, and the name should be \"Presidio to Golden Gate\"; Apple's two descriptions there are good.\r\n\r\nMakes sense indeed !\r\n\r\n> The video b10-3.mov (which I call \"Marin to Golden Gate\") does not seem to have any corresponding descriptions at all in the POIs you sent me, so we should just use mine above.\r\n\r\nOk !\r\n \r\n> (The group of descriptions labelled \"San Francisco Golden Gate from SF\" in the POIs doesn't seem to correspond to any video we have.)\r\n\r\nI guess it's for a new video they shot and we don't have yet ? We'll see I guess !\r\n\r\n> Okay, I think that I've now rewritten all of Apple's original descriptions for those videos for which I've suggested improvements above, so that none of their copyrighted text is mixed in with my suggested descriptions\r\n\r\nTruly awesome, thanks a lot for this !\r\n\r\n> I've also taken the opportunity to make a few small improvements to my descriptions here and there.\r\n> \r\n> I've edited the posts above to reflect all my changes. (I hope that doesn't complicate things for you, but GitHub can show the edit history, yes?)\r\n\r\nNo issue at all. \r\n\r\n> I'm off to San Francisco tomorrow (in about 12 hours, actually), after which I'll be out of touch most likely until Thursday.\r\n> \r\n> In the meantime, thank you for all your fine work on Aerial!\r\n\r\nEnjoy your time there ! And thanks for doing this, I should have this working when you get back \r\n\r\n\r\n > Looking at the new **names** I proposed (not descriptions) in 1.4.1test7, I'm noticing that several are too long. I would suggest:\r\n> \r\n> **_Los Angeles_**\r\n> \r\n> Change \"Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110)\" to \"Harbor Freeway\"\r\n> Change \"Los Angeles International Airport\" to \"Los Angeles Int\u2019l Airport\"\r\n> \r\n> **_San Francisco_**\r\n> \r\n> Change \"Marin Headlands to Golden Gate\" to \"Marin to Golden Gate\"\r\n> Change \"The Embarcadero and Market Street\" to \"Embarcadero, Market Street\" (both day & night)\r\n\r\nI can also make the list slightly larger ? I'll try to see what looks good. Thanks ! I'm merging your stuff but you kept some stuff like change this and that and other annotations that I'm not sure what I should do with for a couple of videos.\r\n\r\nI don't change/add/remove, I only put your stuff in a new file and those will be used in place of Apple's description. I also need a 0 always. \r\n\r\n> First up: **_San Francisco Day_**\r\n> **Movie:** b4-3.mov\r\n> **Name:** Golden Gate from SF\r\n> **Descriptions:** Three descriptions appear too early and should simply be removed:\r\n> _60s:_ The description \"Alongside the Golden Gate Bridge heading toward the Marin Headlands\" appears two minutes too early. It also appears to be superfluous, as there's another \"alongside\" description, correctly timed, at 240s.\r\n> _140s:_ The description \"Crossing over the Golden Gate Bridge\" likewise appears too early, as we haven't reached the bridge yet.\r\n> _230s:_ The description \"Passing by the North Tower of the Golden Gate Bridge\" is far more premature, as we never do pass the north tower in this video. In fact, we have not even reached the _south_ tower yet.\r\n\r\nI don't have a 0 and don't know what to do with that :)\r\n\r\n> **Movie:** b10-3.mov\r\n> **Name:** Change \"Presidio to Golden Gate\" to \"Marin to Golden Gate\"\r\n> **Descriptions:** Lost in the fog, these descriptions are going the wrong way!\r\n> _Start:_ Change \"Moving along the Presidio of San Francisco toward the Golden Gate Bridge\" to \"Moving over the Marin Headlands along Highway 101 toward the Golden Gate Bridge\"\r\n> _~20s:_ Add \"Horseshoe Cove appearing on the left\"\r\n> _~130s:_ Add \"Passing over Battery Spencer\"\r\n> _~192s:_ Change \"Crossing the Golden Gate Bridge toward the Marin Headlands\" to \"Crossing the Golden Gate Bridge toward San Francisco\"\r\n\r\nI'll add those 4 as is and same thing for the rest.  So here's a build with the new strings in place. They are enabled by default as long as your default language is english, or you unchecked the translate when available thing.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test9/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIncludes the new enhanced names for all too. \r\n\r\nAs for the data, I put it in a JSON file that's bundled with the screensaver. \r\n\r\nYou can see it here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/blob/feature/v1.4.2/Aerial/Resources/Community/en.json\r\n\r\nIt should be easy enough to maintain and eventually translate into other languages. The new video names are also in this file for consistency.\r\n\r\nIf all goes right I'll beta1 this soon.\r\n Haha no problem thanks ! \r\n\r\nI'll add those to the json for next version. It looks pretty good with your new strings you'll see ;) Haha :) Enjoy your trip !\n\n> Le 20 oct. 2018 \u00e0 21:31, SeanMSmith <notifications@github.com> a \u00e9crit :\n> \n> I'm off to SF now and will have to wait until I get back to check out the new Aerial--by which time, at the rate you're going, there'll be so many improvements I'll barely recognize it! :D\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/547#issuecomment-431611447>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/Ajzg_WUWGljOtJYzhFp5bFkXuxNQ123Jks5um3oLgaJpZM4Xsg4R>.\n> \n\n > Guillaume, I would still suggest changing the name \"Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110)\" to \"Harbor Freeway\".

I'll modify those but if you are confortable enough to do it, you can then modify it yourself easily. Let me know if you want help figuring how to.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/blob/feature/v1.4.2/Aerial/Resources/Community/en.json\r\n\r\n> Would it be possible to italicize the names of the ships in the community descriptions for Fisherman's Wharf and the three River Thames videos? That is the usual style in English.\r\n> \r\n> So HMS _Belfast_, SS _Jeremiah O\u2019Brien_, and USS _Pampanito_. (Note that the \"HMS\", \"SS\", and \"USS\" are _not_ italicized.)\r\n\r\nDefinitely possible, but will need a bit of extra work. I'll think about it and get back to you. \r\n Yep ! Go to this page : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/ (make sure you don't fork my copy that I linked above, sorry about that. If you did, delete your fork and refork JohnCoates, it will make your life 100% easier)\r\n\r\nPress fork (top right) to create your own fork (copy) of the repository. Then inside that repository (should probably be something like https://github.com/SeanMSmith/Aerial/) browse to Aerial/Resources/Community/en.json\r\n\r\nThen you can edit the file. When your changes are done, it will probably suggest you to make a pull request in yellow. If not, there's a button for that (New pull request), it should autofill source (your fork) and destination (JohnCoates/Aerial). Submit the thing and it will appear here so I can merge the changes.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want any more help with that ! Hopefully we can extend the method for other languages too.  Oops probably forgot those sorry, I have to edit those in code so will take care of that tomorrow.  Awesome ! So as you've probably seen, it makes a pull request here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/591\r\n\r\nI just merge it, so now your changes appear directly here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Resources/Community/en.json \r\n\r\nThey will be picked up automatically in next release this way, makes it easier for me too :) Thanks ! You can rinse/repeat as much as you need. \r\n\r\nYou can also make several changes on your repository before making the PR if you want to start working on something but don't want to push it yet (each change is a \"commit\", as you've probably seen, a fork is a \"snapshot\" of the files at a point in time, commits are just the difference (remove a line, add a line) to a file, and a pull request is the act of merging back your changes from your fork to the main one). beta 3 has your changes : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta3/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n Done :) \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/594\r\n\r\n in the future, if you're looking for video ids, you can have a look here : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Models/AerialVideo.swift\r\n(look for TimeInformation at the beginning)\r\n\r\nand here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Models/ManifestLoader.swift\r\n\r\n(mergePOI)  Oops ! Thanks, will be fixed in next builds :) No need to test, but FYI fixed in \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test1/Aerial.saver.zip  You mean on the list on the left ? Can you post a screenshot of what you see ? It says space > space ?? \r\n\r\nAlso, macOS version ?\r\n\r\nHere's what I have here FYI on 2 macs (10.13.6 and 10.14.1beta):\r\n \r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-16 a 20 46 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47039653-b9eceb00-d184-11e8-8c65-b7a7279b03be.png)\r\n Thanks for your quick reply. In the Text panel, do you have the \"Display in preferred language when available\" selected ? If so, what does the line just below says ?\r\n\r\nAlso, just to confirm, you don't see this in other videos ?\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting this, I'll have a look.  Ha that explains it ! I definitely haven't and they definitely should be there. Did you perhaps change the cache folder to another place ?\r\n\r\nFYI, the extra strings are contained in the  ~/Library/Caches/Aerial/TVIdleScreenStrings.bundle file\r\n\r\nSo since you don't have those, it fallbacks to the short name. \r\n\r\nYou still see Aerial working because the JSONs are saved in the preference files (something that remains of the old original version) and I use that if available and don't try to redownload the files. In your specific case though that's an issue.\r\n\r\nEasy fix, delete ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.JohnCoates.Aerial.(UUID).plist\r\n\r\nThis will reset all settings and redownload/reprocess the JSONs (it won't redownload videos) and gives you back the descriptions. You'll also see extended descriptions in the \"old\" videos like London as a bonus !\r\n\r\nI'll try to add a better mechanism to redownload the .tar/jsons in the next version, sorry about that again ! Makes sense, by removing the cache the files were gone but not the plist. \r\n\r\nWhile unusual, still better to have a fix in a upcoming release. Thanks for your report on this ! I'm not sure we can cleanup anything at uninstall, I'll have a look ! But at startup I'll try and do some more sanity checks, there's a new error pane coming in 1.4.2 just for stuff like that. > Do you have to remove the old version before installing a new version?\r\n\r\nYou don't, but you probably need to restart the System Preferences (close and reopen) in order to properly reload the plist (ironically !) and the ressources (you may see the wrong version show up and an unresponsive UI). As far as we know, that's a bug with the way Swift plugins are loaded. \r\n\r\nIt fixes itself the next time you launch System Preferences and we have no workaround so far (apart from restarting system prefs which we suggest on the project readme). I'll try to make a sample project and submit a radar to Apple when I have a sec. \r\n\r\n> I understand when you are updating to a new versions, maintaining the plist is useful to ensure the settings stay them, but for people who want to fully remove it, an uninstall option may be nice.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, Aerial is not a standalone app, it's a \"plugin\" for System Preferences. So the install/uninstall mechanism is a bit more restricted. That's why when you double click the .saver, it starts System Preferences who then asks you if you want to install/replace existing version. \r\n\r\n> On a related note; is it possible to have an update feature from the preferences pane?\r\n\r\nSame thing as above, we can't really do that for the same reason. We can probably do a new version check (and probably download the new version), but won't be able to install. I'm thinking about adding the version check in the new error pane and point people to the new version. \r\n\r\nAs of today, the supported mechanism for auto update is brew cask. It may lag a bit though (by a few hours usually). They seem to have a few issues right now with their integration server but hopefully 1.4.1 will be there ASAP, we have the pull request ready : https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/53694 > That makes sense. Maybe some instructions would suffice?\r\n\r\nWe do have that !\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Readme.md#uninstallation\r\n\r\nI've updated it with the location of the plist. \r\n\r\n> A notification that there is a new version would be good. VirtualBox for example directs users to a website to download the latest version, which I find bizarre for a company as large as Oracle can not have a proper updater for a standalone app! Adobe does the same with the Flash updater in the System Preferences pane, but that is pretty much dead.\r\n> \r\n> That lag would not be noticeable for most users to be fair.\r\n> \r\n> I use coderelease.io to tell me about your releases.\r\n\r\nMarking as an enhancement for a future version. > Still not working for me. The files are not there for me. Where else could they be?\r\n\r\nYou have the same issue of the titles not showing, that's right ? \r\n\r\nFirst, go to the Cache panel, click \"Show in Finder\", that will open your current cache. This is where the missing files should go. \r\n\r\nOr are you looking for the plist to delete it ? \r\n\r\n`/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.JohnCoates.Aerial.{UUID}.plist`\r\n\r\nWhere YOURUSERNAME is your user name, and {UUID} is a series of numbers/letters. \r\n\r\nAnother place to look at, maybe, `/Library/Preferences` although I'm not sure it would go there. Maybe if you installed the screensaver for all users, although I'd think every users would have it's own plist. Well, here's a workaround, download : https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/resources.tar\r\n\r\nPut that file in the cache folder (look the Show in Finder button in my previous comment). Then untar the file and keep the tar too. If you need help untaring let me know. Put the tar and untar in place. \r\n\r\nYou just need the `TVIdleScreenStrings.bundle` to solve the issue in practice. That file needs to be in the cache folder.  nearly there. move the files from the resources folder in the main cache directory (copy them one level down if you see what I mean ?).\r\n You're welcome :)  > Maybe put that guide in to the readme doc.\r\n> I mean troubleshooting\r\n\r\nGood idea, done  : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Readme.md#troubleshooting I rewrote the loading management to make things much simpler, no more need to go hunt the plist. This will be in 1.4.2. For those who have this issue and don't want to hunt the missing files, try \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test1/Aerial.saver.zip Closing as fixed in 1.4.2beta1 : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.2beta1  Can you try this version ?  See here : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAs for \"finding them\", unsure what's the issue. Get that beta, then scroll down in the list, you'll find SF just before the \"Space\" videos : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-16 a 09 05 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46998386-add04180-d122-11e8-8273-1a482925c5af.png) @LePetitPrince612 come back to us and reopen this is you still have issues  What about having the same popup on the text panel for the text fade speed then ? To me having 0.5 on videos and 2s on text felt super weird so that's why I aligned their duration, but I can bring an option for that.\r\n\r\nSide note, text fades start with a 1s delay compared to video animation, always (and end 1s early). See here for that option : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1rc2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAll good with the Font picker/size by the way ?  Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Yeah I saw that one, also the player doesn't loop either and just stops at the end. It's just a basic video player.\r\n\r\nI should do something about it someday. No problem, I'll keep it open to try to not forget it \ud83d\ude05 That was a quick fix @dVIAN13 : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1rc2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIt should no longer be scrollable, and loop only if it's a preview of a local file (so you don't loop when streaming previews) Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  @dVIAN13 Remind me, one monitor only ?  Oh damn. As a workaround, select mirror mode for multimonitor, I'll pull the build. Good catch and sorry about that one \ud83d\ude05 https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta3 \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\nYes for the mirroring, because of the way the mirroring mode works, that option would take some extra changes. Probably a \"for later\" improvement.  Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Yeah, sorry about that, I have a test version that fixes the bug if you want, was waiting on confirmation before releasing it. If you're willing to give it a shot : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1beta2rc1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIf I may since you have a MacPro, when you click the ? next to preferred video format, do you see a green light in front of H.264 ? (probably red in front of HEVC but that's to be expected). Did the Panel itself crash ? With a specific message ? Or was the UI of the panel \"weird\"/not working. \r\n\r\nIf you try going into the screensaver preferences just after install, and the previous version was in memory, some of the resources won't be loaded and that might cause a crash. Seems to be a MacOS bug with swift screensavers, usually people see a wrong version number and other weird stuff. But it can definitely cause a crash when there's a change to the preferences.\r\n\r\nRegarding desktop background, I think someone tried to do that with the old version of Aerial ? There's an issue about that but I haven't looked into it. See here, I'm not sure if it's still running : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/13\r\n\r\n\r\n Leaving this here for anyone else experiencing the problem : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta3\r\n\r\nI have no idea if there's a way to insert a window behind the desktop in Mojave. I'll keep this in mind for later but don't get your hopes too high ;) Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Looks good here, merging ! Thanks for your contribution !  Can you clarify when you saw the error exactly ? Just after install ? Did it still pop when you closed System Preferences and opened it again ?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a bug with System Preferences and Swift plugins not having all of their ressources reloaded, (that's what cause people to have the wrong version number showing after install). \r\n\r\nWhen you mean 1.4b, you mean 1.4b9 from this repo ? Please try reinstalling 1.4 on top, close System Preferences and reopen and let me know ? Thanks ! @ckhk212 was this a fresh install or on top of 1.2 the first time ? \r\n\r\n@fgaleano you mention fresh install, you didn't have a previous version of Aerial prior to this that's correct ?\r\n\r\nTo both (sorry for all the questions but tried and couldn't reproduce) : \r\n- I assume you installed manually, not through brew ?\r\n- are you behind a proxy/firewall\r\n- which region did you set in MacOS settings\r\n- would you be willing to go into your user library and try deleting  ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.JohnCoates.Aerial.(UUID).plist\r\n- long shot but could you possibly launch console.app, filter by \"Aerial\" top right, then try loading the screensaver again (go back to Destop & Screensaver to generate the error) and let me know of any lines you see in console ? If it doesn't show anything, you may want to try again without the filter and see if there's crash message from System Preferences. \r\n\r\nSorry about that we'll try to find what happens.\r\n\r\nEdit : A couple more ideas : \r\n- Do you know of anything special about your MacOS environment maybe (installed some specific dev tool, another bash, etc or something) ?\r\n- Does ~/Library/Caches/Aerial exist ?\r\n\r\nIf so, do you see in  that folder a : \r\n- resources.tar\r\n- entries.json\r\n- TVIdleScreenStrings.bundle\r\n- tvos11.json\r\n- tvos10.json\r\n- some .mov files (doesn't matter exactly which, just tell me if you have multi megabytes mov files or not) > @glouel. Please see below for my comments to your questions. Thanks.\r\n\r\nFirst thanks for your patience in this and your answers. Going directly to it : \r\n\r\n> * long shot but could you possibly launch console.app, filter by \"Aerial\" top right, then try loading the screensaver again (go back to Destop & Screensaver to generate the error) and let me know of any lines you see in console ? If it doesn't show anything, you may want to try again without the filter and see if there's crash message from System Preferences\r\n>   Here you go \"Aerial: Error can't load tvos11.json from cached directory\"\r\n\r\nOk that line helps a lot !\r\n\r\n> * Does ~/Library/Caches/Aerial exist ?\r\n>   Yup, with these files: `TVIdleScreenStrings.bundle`, `tvos10.json`, `entries.json`, `tvos11.json`, `resources.tar` and not seeing any `.mov` files\r\n\r\nSo you have the file but it can't be loaded. \r\n\r\nCan you tell me which size the tvos11.json file has on your system ? It should be 7 KB. If it's not, can you tell me the size and past the content ? I would guess it's an empty file ?\r\n\r\nThat's the file in question : https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/entries.json\r\n\r\nIf it's an empty file, can you try deleting it and launching again ? See if the file gets downloaded correctly this time ?\r\n Damn ! If that's ok with you I'll make a special debug build to try and track that, I'll ping you back here when done. @ckhk212 if you feel like it, can you try this test build : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1test5/Aerial.saver.zip ?\r\n\r\nI did add a couple of extra checks so it might work outright. But I'd still love the console output (same thing, filter by \"Aerial\", you should see many lines now) as if it's what I think it was, there's something more complex going on.\r\n\r\nThanks ! Ok progress ! Can you filter by AerialML instead in console while opening the panel ?\r\n\r\nHopefully looking for something like this : \r\n```\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165438+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: Manifest init\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165644+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: tvos10.json manifest is cached\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165670+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: 10 true\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165720+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: tvos11.json manifest is cached\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165734+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: 11 true\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165775+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: entries.json manifest is cached\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165788+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: 12 true\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165856+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: manifests are saved in preferences\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165868+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: Loading from plist\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.165883+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: LSM\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.184769+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: lsm12\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.276171+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: lsm11\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.282302+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: lsm10\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.363015+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] AerialML: post json loading\r\n2018-10-14 18:49:49.363223+0200 AerialApp[16647:5897897] 66 videos processed !\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm particularly interested in how many videos were processed (last line) and the lsm12/lsm11/lsm10 lines too ;) \r\n\r\nThe video descriptions might look weird in that build (way too small, depending on when I build for you, sorry !), I'll put a better one, you caught me in the middle of implementing font management. \r\n\r\nThanks again !  You may not see them depending on if the preview starts or not. So launching the saver will work too (you can set a hot corner if needed), I guess opening Aerial's preferences should do the trick too. \r\n\r\nSomehow it doesn't want to load your tvos11.json file. The path thing is intriguing, I'll test something here and report back. \r\n\r\nJust to be clear, you see the UI when you click Screen Saver options right and it roughly works ? \r\n\r\nWith a non empty list ? : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-14 a 11 59 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46919858-d30b6580-cfe5-11e8-90b0-94eb9aa8a3dc.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll see \"One, Two, Three\" instead of the video names on the build I sent.\r\n\r\nEdit: If I can bother you again, can you launch the screensaver and filter for \"video processed\" instead of Aerial ? I forgot to prefix the message, totally my fault ! Sorry I edited my message while you were answering, see the edit above.  Ok that confirms it. You're missing a couple of 4K videos, and I have no idea why ! I'll keep looking into it, thanks for your feedback! Oh I think I got it, you probably have an APFS System Volume with case set to SENSITIVE instead of INSENSITIVE (something that highlighted a typo I made, oops !) ! \r\n\r\nHold on 2 seconds before downgrading, I'll put a new build for you to test if that's ok. @ckhk212 \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1beta1rc1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIf you can do the console thing again, and tell me if there's 66 videos this time. Let's try again : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1beta1rc1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\nOr the build page if that's better : https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/tag/1.4.1beta1rc1  Woohoo \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\nThanks for sticking with my testing today. Feel free to stay on this build, I'll release it as official 1.4.1 beta1 in a bit !  For everyone else who experience this issue, please install 1.4.1 beta 1 (or more recent)\r\n\r\nDownload : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.1beta1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nMore information : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta1 Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  My text layer code is a bit of a mess I have to admit, I wanted to add that too but haven't yet \ud83d\ude05 Perfectly aligning different font sizes in a corner was slightly tricky but I'll think about that one. \r\n\r\nRegarding consistency with the original screensaver, we're way past. I think their fade-in/out are faster (well...), descriptions stay for a much shorter time (but you can show them by touching the remote) and often they don't show at all by themselves (this one puzzles me a bit, maybe a bug in tvOS 12, if you play music, no descriptions will show, etc). \r\n\r\nAnd their rotation is pretty poor (I think it caches 4/5 videos max, and trashes that, download new ones periodically which, philosophically, not a fan).\r\n\r\n10s I think is a pretty good compromise too ! I think 15s is the minimum between two timecodes which limits things a bit on that end. \r\n\r\nEdit : I think adding a separate Descriptions panel (or a better name maybe) to put everything related there, including probably a longer description for the localization one, and the ability to pick which corner you want your descriptions in (probably with the default of having them moving around) and picking font/size might be a good improvement. Not sure if I can tackle that for 1.41, maybe next one (I may release 1.41 as a bugfix if I find the multi monitor bug). Haha, touch\u00e9 !\r\n\r\nAnother thing I really want in since we are offtopic is replacing the \"One,Two,Three\" with proper location names for the city videos. For some (the 4K), we can make something out of the first extra description (there's often only one). For some of the older ones, I know some of the places (SF) but for others we might need help from people who know those locations. Awesome, thanks a lot !  Check 1.4.1 beta for font size support :  https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.1beta1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nEverything new here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta1 @ludwig1224 Right now there's a tiny bit of that in 1.4.1beta1, if you pick the random corner option in the descriptions pane, the description will move around each time the text changes.  > I was thinking more of a continuous jump, during playback for each video. As i said, the video itself is in motion, but it would be better if the title moved around during playback, say, every 10 seconds. Not exactly the same as a random corner, for each new video. \r\n\r\nIt's a bit better than that as many videos have multiple descriptions, and it will move around then too, but yes I do hear your point. I'll keep it in mind for a future release. If you are concerned right now, stay at the default 10 Seconds ;) \r\n \r\n> You wouldn\u2019t speak French, would you? ;)\r\n\r\nGrill\u00e9 \ud83d\ude31 @SeanMSmith one thing I did change that's not in rc2 is removing the color/shadow attributes from the font picker, you just pick font and size now (as it should be, I won't handle color and shadow is always baked in) : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-16 a 11 51 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/47008085-e62f4a00-d139-11e8-881f-b80b84bbc01a.png)\r\n\r\nI won't put another build just for that, it was my last item for 1.4.1. Based on feedback I'll put that up on the repo as a full new version late tonight/tomorrow.  Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Fade in/out should be 2 seconds IIRC. There's one video (one of the Space China ?) that seems to fade infinitely but it's actually the video that ends like that with super low visibility for many seconds, it puzzled me once too. Are you sure that's not what you experienced ?\r\n\r\nDisable and speed if so, why not though 2 secs I though would be a good default, we can find a better default too maybe if that's really too slow.\r\n\r\nEdit : One thing that might happen is that right now the animation code may start before the video is loaded (which might be the multi monitor issue \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/530), that may give you a longer fade at the end, come to think of it, but maybe by 2s. Does that sound right ? Ok that makes sense, I was looking at the code and it seemed like fade outs should be 2s. You're seeing quicker fade ins because they start before the video actually shows up (which can take half a sec/a sec). I'll try to make it stop doing that and add something to switch to shorter fades. \r\n\r\n1s maybe ?\r\n\r\nA menu with Fade in/out : None, 0.5 Second, 1 Second, 2 Second I guess ? Indeed ! It's a fine line and sometimes they tend to initially overdo the \"one perfect default fits all\" before begrudgingly adding finer grain options :) \r\n\r\nBut even if that can be frustrating once in a while, I'll still take that over the RTFM attitude with half of the options undocumented !\r\n\r\nI'll try to add a few options in a test build so we can see what makes sense.  When you got a sec, check \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nMy heart says 0.5 default \ud83d\ude31\r\n\r\nI only adjusted the video fade, I'll align the text fades to the same value I guess.  It may look shorter because it's a linear fade, while you may be used to better ease in/ease out fades, but the time is correct. \r\n\r\nFade ins were especially not correct in default 1.4 and cut by your video initialization time. I'll look into ease in/out to get a better result and see where that goes. So I added cubic ease which makes them feel more natural, but the cubic function may make them feel even shorter. I went with 1s default on that build for new users, can you let me know what you think when you have a sec? \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1test4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThis one also has video names AND extra descriptions for old videos (try London, SF, NY...) : \r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-14 a 11 59 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46915216-c6b4e780-cfa8-11e8-8a10-234236a5332b.png)\r\n \r\nEdit : As posted elsewhere, 1.4.1 beta 1 is out with these changes.  A bit ;) \r\n\r\nI did change the fade to add a cubic ease, they look more natural now (probably the difference you feel). \r\n\r\nI'll keep those 4 values, I think they give a good balance. All texts (including the new clock) use the same fade time too.  I have a hard time keeping up, I made too many builds ! As long as they are correct now... ;) (and see my answer there) Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  I added tooltips to my 1.41 branch yesterday, for this one I added : \"If enabled, descriptions will get translated to your macOS locale language if available\"\r\n\r\nAny suggestions for improvement ? Done ! Thanks !  First, still displays 1.2, please close System Preferences and open it again, this should fix it. This seems to be a bug with Swift screensavers on MacOS that aren't getting their resources completely reloaded properly on upgrading. \r\n\r\nSo, with 1.4, we use the most recent video version available (we look for them in tvos12, tvos11 and tvos10 JSONs in that order). Whether those are better or not is subjective indeed, they are more color saturated and sometimes recropped. Some are slightly less blocky too. But they are aligned in \"quality\" with the other video formats (HEVC 1080p and 4K) so it makes more sense for us to use the same versions independent of video format.  \r\n\r\nAs of right now, we don't purge the old files, though I'll mark this as something to look at for next version !  @SeanMSmith for sure, never ever delete anything behind the user's back. \r\n\r\nAs part of the enhancements to the cache panel (at the very list, show how big the cache currently is), I was thinking of adding maybe some sort of menu where there would be some purging options : \r\n- Purge old/duplicate videos (there are actually some litteral duplicates, we don't download them in 1.4 but they may have been downloaded before) \r\n- Purge other formats (so if you have 4K selected, purge everything that wouldn't be played, so all 4K and all \"best available format\" for each video)\r\n- Purge out of rotation (mayyyybe)\r\n\r\nThere are many considerations that comes with each of these, so it's not exactly a straightforward implementation. All would come with a confirmation prompt I think, some sort of list to review is a good idea although UI wise, since we're already in a sheet, slightly unsure how that would present itself (I guess a modal box). I do like the move to trash idea a lot ! Yes, it only downloads the \"best available format\", whatever method you use. So delete manually the videos (you can keep the 4K by filtering in finder and removing the rest, those aren't duped, but you can delete everything if you have bandwidth) and redownload -> you'll get a completely deduped directory with only best versions available. \r\n\r\nIf you use the \"Download All\" in the menu (below the video list in main pane), you'll see the individual videos getting downloaded as the list updates itself ;)  The list will tell you the status of the best available format for your preferred format only. If you switch format you'll see the list update.\r\n\r\nI had started to make a grid that showed each video in each format for the cache, but ended up scrapping it for some reason. \r\n\r\nAs for versions, there's up to 5 I think. tvOS12 JSON has 3 format, tvOS10 litteraly has duplicates in it. 1.4+ never download duplicates or \"outdated\" versions. \r\n\r\nSo back to your question, scrap your cache and redownload, it will be clean with one best file per video \r\n:) Just to give some background, what Aerial 1.4 does is : \r\n- parse the tvOS12 and grab every video urls in all formats\r\n- parse the tvOS11 and grab every video urls in all formats for what we don't yet have (there are no H.264 links here, two videos are in there that aren't in the tvOS12 url, others are all the same)\r\n- parse the tvOS10 and grab every video urls in all formats for what we don't yet have\r\n\r\nAt every point, it tries to \"merge\" info (so for example, Liwa is only in tvOS11 JSON as 1080p HEVC and 4K HEVC, no 1080p H.264, but it's in the tvOS10 JSON as H.264, so we merge that H.264 url in the list). Merging is done by looking at the UUID of each video when possible, but we also have a list of duplicate UUID so we can merge those correctly.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, there are litteral duplicates with different names and UUID that we have to exclude, and videos that are available in lower quality that gets excluded. \r\n\r\nAgain on top of that, we merge extra info : \r\n- missing videos from the JSON (Dubai night 2 in 4K, Sheikh road)\r\n- the extra descriptions identifier for what's called the point of interests (when text shows up in the middle of a video, I recently relinked that for the old non 4K videos that have different IDs than those used by that list)\r\n- the better names (to replace \"One, two, three\")\r\n\r\nAt the end, you get a perfectly deduplicated list with all the \"best\" urls for each of the 3 video format (when available) and that's what Aerial uses now :)   As you can see on  the left column, not every video is available in 4K. Only those with the \"4K\" label are, the oldest ones are 1080p H.264 only and you have those selected too for playback.\r\n\r\nIf you strictly only want 4K, you'll have to disable the old videos. Click the action button below the list and click the \"Check only 4K\", this way you'll have what you expect. \r\n\r\nYou can check for  yourself the old files by going to the \"Cache\" tab and click \"Show in Finder\", this will show you the videos and you can open them in quicktime. You'll see that on a 5K display, some can be extremely blocky indeed.  > I now have only 4K videos selected on the left. And Preferred = 4K. \r\n\r\nGood !\r\n\r\n> Sometimes the main display shows a video. Sometimes it does not.\r\n\r\nNot good, that's a bug.\r\n\r\n> I've noticed that when the internal monitor (on the right) does not display a video, the external monitor (on the left) also does not display the video name. \r\n\r\nThe name here only shows on my main monitor when mirrored, not on both. That may be a side bug but unrelated. \r\n\r\nA few things if you may : \r\n- Can you tell me which version of MacOS you are running ?\r\n- Year model of your iMac 5K and resolution of your external screen ?\r\n- Also, can you possibly disable the \"show clock\" option, see if that somehow fixes the problem ? (long shot but we've seen weird things !)\r\n- Do you see the same issue when you have \"Play different Aerial on each display\" checked ?\r\n\r\n> Maybe different options are in order:\r\n> \r\n> The checkbox **Play different Aerial on each display** becomes a select \"**Play Aerials**\":\r\n> \r\n> * Only on main display\r\n> * Mirrored on every display\r\n> * Independently on each display\r\n\r\nYep, main screen only is on my todo list. But by default, it should mirror. \r\n\r\n> Then the options w/in **Show Descriptions**:\r\n> \r\n> * 10 Seconds\r\n> * Always\r\n> * Debug (output the file name, codec, dimensions, etc)\r\n\r\nWe probably need a debug option somewhere yep ! Right now I'm working on the network debug but I'll try to think about this one. \r\n\r\n> I'm a web developer so I don't know the coding involved in native apps. Otherwise I'd make pull requests. Thank you for this awesome Screensaver!\r\n\r\nThanks for your report ! Please let me know about the stuff above so hopefully we can fix that. Follow up, did a quick testing : \r\n- On my iMac 5K (Late 2015), running Mojave, and an external screen (1280x800) : Always OK\r\n- On my Macbook Air (2011), running 10.13.6, same external screen (1280x800) : I reproduce your bug\r\n- On my Macbook Air (2011), running 10.13.6, larger external screen (1920x1200) : I reproduce your bug\r\n\r\nCan you confirm you're running 10.13.6 ? I'm afraid this may be one of these video driver issues that's out of our control. Same goes for so many of the scale bugs, wrong ratio, black bars that comes and goes with new video drivers.  Are you sure you got the name on both screens in mirror mode ? Or with play different checked ? Sorry to insist but that might be important ! \r\n\r\nNoted for the clock and your Mac info, thanks. As far as I know on your iMac, it should be using Intel QuickSync to decode (so pretty close to what happens on my Macbook Air of the same year, Sandy Bridge generation).\r\n\r\nI'm adding a Main display only option right now, I'll ping you back with a beta.   @WebVeteran please try this build for \"main display only\" mode : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.41test1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAnd let me know how it goes ?\r\n\r\nAnd noted for the both screens, I may have an idea I'll ping you again if I find something. Ok great ! I'll keep looking for the other bug to see if that's on my changes or not.\r\n\r\nRegarding framerate, 4K HEVC is fully CPU decoded on your Mac so that's definitely expected. Transcoding the 4K videos to H.264 with x264/Handbrake would significantly lower the load in your specific case.  @WebVeteran when you can, can you give a shot to this build, and try mirror mode again ? \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nEdit : Use this instead : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.1beta1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nSeems fixed here after a dozen hot corner tries, you'll still only get description on main screen but mirror mode should always show the video on both now. Can you confirm ? > Done. This is what I found, using only 4K videos...\r\n> \r\n> **1.4.1 TEST2**\r\n> Mirrored: The same video plays on both. Very smooth. The title is only on the main screen.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n> Also, the fade effect only works on the main screen.\r\n\r\nRight. That I can probably fix\r\n\r\n> **1.4.1 BETA1**\r\n> If I click Preview the screens go blank. The system is unresponsive. I hear a beep. The desktop comes back on and the System Preferences are gone.\r\n> If I use a hot corner the screens go blank. Then grey apples appear, one on each screen.\r\n?!!\r\n\r\nSorry about that then. Everytime, independant of mirror etc ? Once is too much but that may help me narrow it down. Thanks for your feedback, hopefully I can fix that regression \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\nEdit : I've reproduced it on 10.13 on my Macbook Air, it actually launches another screensaver (because Aerial crashes I guess). I'll try and fix that ! Reproduced on Mojave too, I guess it's the new fade ins or the description stuff, trying to track it :) Found it, I'll get a new build out soonish, will ping you back.  @WebVeteran took some time but here goes : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta3\r\n\r\nShould be fixed for you. The fade-in/out is also now showing on all screens. Not the descriptions. There are some new options including a same styled clock and ability to have a message on screen.   Was that with beta 2 or beta 3 ? I did bork beta 2 if you didn't see my edit. Again apologies about b2. \r\n\r\nThanks for your report, that one is an easy fix, weird though I didn't see it on mojave but just saw it on 10.13 !  I fixed the flickering in this build : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.1rc/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThanks for catching that ! Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Thanks, this will be fixed in next release !  @alex-mohemian Can you go to terminal and type `/usr/bin/corebrightnessdiag nightshift-internal` and paste me the output ? Also let me know which version of macOS you have ?\r\n\r\nAlso please make sure you've closed System Preferences and reopened it again, as the first update from 1.2 may lead to weird stuff. @alex-mohemian Thanks for coming back to me on this, see your output, where it says : \r\n\r\n```\r\nNight Shift Sunset/Sunrise\r\n(null)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is where I gather the Sunset and Sunrise time, this should not say null ! Here's what I get here \r\n\r\n```\r\nNight Shift Sunset/Sunrise\r\n{\r\n    isDaylight = 1;\r\n    nextSunrise = \"2018-10-13 06:21:25 +0000\";\r\n    nextSunset = \"2018-10-13 17:07:00 +0000\";\r\n    previousSunrise = \"2018-10-11 06:18:18 +0000\";\r\n    previousSunset = \"2018-10-11 17:11:06 +0000\";\r\n    sunrise = \"2018-10-12 06:19:51 +0000\";\r\n    sunset = \"2018-10-12 17:09:02 +0000\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, in all likelihood, you may have nightshift enabled but the sunset/sunrise detection doesn't work (so it probably doesn't switch by itself if you have enabled it, or not at exact sunset/sunrise times).\r\n\r\nCan you check if you have set the timezone correctly on your mac ? Are you behind any strict firewall ? You may be blocking a service that macOS needs to determine sunset and sunrise time, although right now I'm not exactly sure which ones are necessary. \r\n\r\nEdit : Can you go into System Preferences > Displays > Night Shift tab, you get a dropdown on that page, the last option lets you set night shift from Sunset to Sunrise. Is that available ? Ha, good to know, I can probably put a better error message on that specific case, thanks !  As of right now the cask still points to 1.2.  the new url doesn't have the v, let me see if I can fix that ! Ok just updated the tag release, it now points to \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n@travi Could you try running the script again ?  My bad I missed the .saver. Should be correct now : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4/Aerial.zip\r\n\r\n@travi, Thanks for your help in this and your patience :) Awesome, thank you for this !  Damn ! I think it was merged twice as someone else had another PR, see here : https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/53234\r\n\r\nBut this one had the saver thing. Yours was also merged and is more recent, so one think it would override the other one... Well I added both a Aerial.saver.zip to the release alongside the other, so now it works :D\r\n\r\nAnd if your merge gets priority it should still work !\r\n\r\nThanks again for taking care of this @travi ! @travi any chance you can run the script for \"1.4.1\" ? \r\n\r\nI have some permission error to push here, because of a messed up git config it seems. Thank you so much for this ! Looks like their CI setup was borked but it's finally up \ud83c\udf89 @travi Can I bother you again for 1.4.2 ?  Many thanks !! @travi It got merged thanks. But I had to release a 1.4.3, any chance you can run it again ? Sorry for asking twice today ! And already merged, well thank you very much for the first one ! @travi I really need to fix my setup but if I can bother you again for 1.4.4 ? Thanks ! No worries, many many thanks !\r\n\r\nEdit : And already merged :) Thanks again for making the PR.  Expanded readme for 1.4, with extra sections regarding offline usage, hardware decoding, and new features. \r\n\r\nStill need fresh screenshots :)  Looks good, I think we should merge it straight after https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/521 (I should have my final changes there today). > Will #521 still be a pre-release/beta?\r\n\r\nHopefully not. Hey, sorry about that, I was waiting on word from another maintainer before merging the big 1.4 feature push. I will probably end up merging all this today. Thanks for your contribution and hang on, it's coming I promise ;) Again, thanks @AdrianBinDC for this and sorry for the delay !  Were you restricting to day/night ? If so how many videos in each bucket ? Ok thanks for the report ! So update on that one, twice in a row is a bug I added by fixing the caching playback and cutting extraneous network connexions \ud83d\ude05\r\n \r\nOne gaper though was always possible before. Generating a playlist is not as simple as it seems as we can have multiple monitors with different videos and with the day/night change, the playlist may become wrong. I'll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nEdit : fixed, see the PR Marking as fixed in 1.4  Yeah no problem, I just post the test builds there before we merge it here so don't worry. \r\n\r\nThanks for the report but this is a peculiar one I admit, because the tvos11.json file that you see in cache is the URL that @esetnik was using, which as you pointed no longer include that video. As far as I see, that's the only JSON URL that he used in his builds, unless I missed something.\r\n\r\nSo maybe Apple removed it at some point from that JSON ? Maybe there are more hidden 4K videos we don't know of in some json somewhere, or no longer linked but still up ? That's the first I hear of the JSON actually changing which is even more peculiar... Ok thanks ! Maybe we should checksum those jsons as an experiment or something :) \r\n\r\nIf it's just one video, I can add a workaround I guess. \r\n\r\nEdit : Added one, will be in next beta : \r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-06 a 07 17 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46573952-a8ddf600-c99c-11e8-91f1-604eadae8b80.png)\r\n The video is bundled with the tvOS12 update, it's not pulled online on tvOS12 (which is why it's not in the JSON). \r\n\r\nIt's in the tvOS11 JSON though, so we'll have it in 1.4. If you're in a hurry you can try this beta : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta16/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nIt shows as LA Night 3. I'm hoping to get finale 1.4 out either today or tomorrow. \r\n Closing as fixed in release 1.4  I think hardware whitelist is probably the best we can do right now, as things are unpredictible otherwise. \r\n\r\nLinking to a couple of posts recapping what we know on GVA, I think there's a private API to check if the presented asset will be hw accelerated or not, but quite didn't find it ! \r\n\r\nThis comment and below recap a lot of what we know so far : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512#issuecomment-426052836\r\n\r\nThis one https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/503#issuecomment-426356557 seem to show that on 2016 Macbook Pros, with Skylake (no HEVC Main10 support) and Polaris 11 (should support Main10 !), it defaults to Skylake. There's an API it seems to switch the hwdecoding GPU too (linked in one of these), would need some testing. Agreed \ud83d\udc4d \r\nRight now we default to 1080p H.264 for everyone which is the safest thing to do. One last thing on my mind on the topic, a workaround would be a script to reencode the videos to 8 bit using x265.  Nope still working on this.  Will post a test version later with this, got a pretty good detection mechanism in place now.  Closing this with \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta1/Aerial.saver.zip  This is the big one, includes everything from my previous PR \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/518 : \r\n\r\n- Extra descriptions are now shown when available. Default to english with the option to localize (per my issue, there might be some displaying bugs in some non latin languages, but hard to get feedback from it, it will come soon enough when released I guess).\r\n- Added fade in/out on the videos themselves\r\n- Added preliminary detection for hardware acceleration support, and a better description based on latest findings (HEVC videos are encoded at Main10 profile which is not fully hardware accelerated pre 2017 Macs where the Intel iGPU is used)\r\n- Don't redownload the tvOS 12 .tar file if already present in cache directory per this discussion\r\n#509\r\n- Bypassing the VideoCache mecanism when the file is already fully cached. While it's a clever trick, it had a drawback of trying to assess the file duration, generating those error on console (and a 240 KB network request on every video) :\r\n`2018-10-01 20:17:53.633735+0200 AerialApp[10827:5184263] [] [20:17:53.634] curlh_lookupAndRetainRegisteredInfoForRequestIDOnQueue signalled err=-17374 (kFigCustomURLHandlerError_RequestingClientGone) (no requestingClient for this request) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia_frameworks/CoreMedia-2282.15/Sources/DataIO/CustomURLHandling/FigCustomURLHandling.c:1223`\r\nI think it also makes the video playback start slightly faster as a bonus. Haven't seen any network traffic since the fix.\r\n- Implemented a \"Never Stream Videos\" option. Only cached videos will be used if any.\r\n- Brought back check/uncheck all option below the list\r\n- Some preparation for bringing back tvOS 10/11\r\n\r\nAnd : \r\n\r\n- Added new DownloadManager for queuing/managing simultaneous downloads (only used for JSONs so far)\r\n- Added tvOS10 & tvOS11 videos (with list merging/blacklisted dupes, etc)\r\n- Space videos are now grouped together for convenience\r\n- Now providing day/night info for tvOS11/12 videos, the day/night indicator is back in the side column in preference pane \r\n- Moved `Video Format` to main pane, renamed to `Preferred Video Format`. Aerial will play the best available format based on preferred choice (if only 1080p H.264 is available and Preferred set to 4K, will still play the 1080p H.264)\r\n- Added cached offline mode, will load from jsons in the cache directory before trying to fetch JSONs online \r\n- Fixed a bug where awakeFromNib was called dozens of times (once per TableCellView) at startup\r\n- Added day/night mode based on specified sunrise and sunset times (new Time pane)\r\n- Added Night Shift support to automatically detect sunrise and sunrise time (MacOS 10.12.4 and a supported Mac needed, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513)\r\n- Added Light Mode/Dark Mode detection (MacOS 10.14 required) for day/night videos\r\n\r\nThis is a huge merge but it implements a lot of things that people kept requesting. As the UI was crowded already, I added a Time tab : \r\n\r\n<img width=\"892\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-10-05 a 17 43 05\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46545264-26830280-c8c6-11e8-855d-529bf801d452.png\">\r\n\r\n@esetnik can you maybe have a quick look ? I'll merge and push a beta release later tonight if all looks good, it looks pretty solid here so far.  Put a beta build here too for testing : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta10/Aerial.saver.zip Hehe thanks :) \r\n\r\nI thought the timepicker would be localized automatically, I'll have a look. @esetnik thanks for the quick check\r\n1) Yeah I should have merged my other branch, good to know.\r\n\r\n2) So right now it chooses the closest available, in order to make sure you always have access to all videos. If you pick 4K it will look for 1080pHEVC then 1080pH264, conversely, if you pick 1080pH264 and not available (only one HK video), you'll get 1080pHEVC for this one. I thought it was a better compromise than restricting strictly to what you want. I like the tag idea, I wanted to put two icons on the list (one to show if cached, one to show if 4K), I'll have a look at that. In the meantime, I wanted to add in the select menu below the list an option to select/deselect all 4K videos.\r\n\r\n3) Oops, I'll have a look\r\n\r\n4) You should try closing and reopening the pane, I think system preferences doesn't reload the user preferences which mess that first launch.\r\n\r\n5) I added \"may\" as the detection state is uncertain right now, per discussion on a couple of threads. The API only allows to test for HEVC, not specifically HEVC Main10 profile  (so it answers yes on my iMac despite not being supported). I can make it green again if you think that's better, but leaving the may (I think the extra description I gave should be enough warning) 3) Just fixed ! I thought it was blurry too, should have thought about contentScale, nice catch thanks ;)\r\n4) is annoying I agree, but not much we can do, it tripped me each time I added some new defaultvalues that weren't loaded\r\n5) Agreed for 5 ! I think a dedicated issue where we explain current support is a good idea, linked in the readme  > I think also #336 can be closed since you reimplemented fading\r\n\r\nYep, I looked at that PR but it had some drawbacks, forced the old offline mode etc.  Ok, I added the \"Check Only 4K\" option as a temporary workaround for 2 until we put tags in the outlineView. \r\n\r\nI'll try having a look at the 24h / AM/PM localization for the Time pane.\r\n\r\n(and yep on other closings)\r\n Quick update, I nearly got the label thing to a pretty state : \r\n![screen shot 2018-10-05 at 10 11 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46558334-09155f00-c8ed-11e8-8d04-41e1bdfe05f5.png)\r\n\r\nOnly issue is, I have a redraw bug when using the menu. I also added a \"Check only Cached\" menu option with the \"Check only 4K\". Will see if I can fix that tomorrow, that's it for me today ;)\r\n\r\nI also think I got a lead on localizing the times, though it's a bit messy ! (got inspired...) \r\nTest build here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta11/Aerial.saver.zip > great! testing now. like I mentioned, here is how time is displayed\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-05 at 2 31 38 pm\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46561208-946e0080-c8ab-11e8-8cfe-68bb024c17e2.png\">\r\n\r\nWas it like that in previous beta ?? I thought I discarded my trials on that. The AM/PM is correct for you right ? Can you confirm that you can change those values (change, click done, reopen to see if they are persisted or not) ?\r\n\r\nIf so, it's just the display of the night shift ones then that I got to fix. Damn, I was trying to reproduce a bug on the boxes \ud83d\ude06  I'll fix that one tomorrow then, no problem. Should mean not in cache for your preferred format (hopefully will make that a button to start download). \r\n\r\nIt may not live update if what you did is went to cache, download the missing stuff, then went back to the panel, did I get that right ? I think I need to force reload the list after updating cache :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll check that tomorrow too thanks ! (what a lovely mess, thanks sublime merge for getting me out of it \ud83e\udd15 )\r\n\r\n@dVIAN13 can you check this build and let me know if the AM/PM thing is fixed for you ?  \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta12/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n- Tentative fix for Night Shift dates not displayed correctly on AM/PM systems\r\n- Fix garbled day/night icons on non retina displays\r\n- Tentative contentScale on AVPlayerLayer (looks slightly sharper on retina displays)\r\n- Fix video list cached indicators not getting refreshed when downloading new videos or changing preferred video format\r\n- Added labels & legend for clarity\r\n- Temporary changed the icon to a + for <10.12.2 compatibility > - On a non-retina display, the 4K labels look a smidge too low - as in, by a pixel \r\n\r\nJust saw that, will be fixed in next build\r\n\r\n> - Day/Night icons (on my non-Retina external display) in dark mode are black on dark grey. This is makes them difficult to see due to the low contrast difference.\r\n\r\nYep it's still the original icons, I'm not sure where they come from. Those are PDF files too, will check if I can find some suitable replacements. \r\n\r\n> - What does the tvOS12 localise option do? Perhaps a help widget to explain, if possible? The video and description fades are gorgeous, by the way.\r\n\r\nIt shows the description in your local language (if not english), maybe a help or a better description for that is needed ?\r\n\r\nThanks ! > @glouel, the AM/PM are there!, thank you!\r\n> <img alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-06 at 12 34 01 pm\" width=\"603\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46575150-b6778980-c964-11e8-86bc-3ca2fa25a568.png\">\r\n> \r\n> great job and continue to keep up the work. I really would like to buy you a coffee or beer(if that's your thing). Think about adding a support button for yourself to your git page or something!\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\nThanks for checking it out ! (and I'll think about it ;)) (still working on finishing up two more features that I really want to add for 1.4, single video download and download checked videos, hopefully by tomorrow) So finally got the last bits I really wanted in : \r\n- If you haven't cached a video yet, there's now a + round button that you can click to individually download that video.\r\n- In the menu below the video list, there are now two new options, Download Checked, Download All. \r\n\r\nYou can select multiple videos individually (they will get queued, with the download indicator changing to a progress when it's actually downloading), same thing happen with Download Checked/All, it looks like this : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-08 a 10 07 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46631528-f6e32d00-cb47-11e8-9332-9fc562b692b2.png)\r\n\r\nAs of right now, I set the queue to 1 at a time, although it can do more. I've tried to clean up a bit the Cache Panel a bit too, just cosmetic stuff. Finally, added a don't stream previews for those who never want any network traffic. \r\n\r\nBeta build here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta14/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nApart from bug fixes, I'm not touching this branch anymore featurewise, so hopefully we can finally merge this and release a 1.4.  You're quick ;) \r\n\r\nDamn, about 1), indeed it's still offcenter here when compiled as a screensaver, yet it looks ok in Xcode and the test App \ud83d\ude31 I'll try to find a workaround tomorrow, thanks for catching that.\r\n\r\n2) Would you keep what's inside the () ? It certainly would look cleaner without, I guess \"Never stream previews\" is self explanatory enough ?\r\n\r\n So per the last feedback, a few tweaks :\r\n \r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-09 a 12 07 34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46662889-e15c1a80-cbbc-11e8-915a-65563655082b.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Fixed the 4K label alignment, made the list slightly larger, the queue image slightly larger too, and the progress bar shorter. Everything fits better with no more overlap. \r\n- If you've disabled the preview streaming, there's now a text mentioning it.Should be much clearer than the description I had put previously. \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-09 a 12 08 59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46662996-2aac6a00-cbbd-11e8-819b-7506c4254064.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Dark Mode icons for day/night \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-09 a 12 09 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46663042-5af40880-cbbd-11e8-88de-482396879f9b.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Shortened to Never stream previews (cf earlier) \r\n- Added a warning about file size, so people aren't surprised\r\n- Added \"Show in Finder\" button\r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-09 a 12 06 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46663101-82e36c00-cbbd-11e8-9ba4-5b1ad02af9a4.jpg)\r\n\r\n- Finally reduced the font size in the preview \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\nI also added a fix for the Korea thing @SeanMSmith mentioned. In the future, I think we could consider filling in basic descriptions about videos lacking them, to replace the \"One, Two, Three\" etc\r\n\r\nbeta build : https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta15/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n> I also would like to be able to buy you a beer, and to buy one for Ethan as well, for your impressive work maintaining and improving Aerial!\r\n\r\nI did add a link to my profile if that's your thing but don't feel like you have to. \r\n\r\n\r\n@esetnik, I think we should consider merging this now, any objection ? > Hi, this may have been answered, but some of these don't seem to work on my MBP. I'm running the dev beta of Mojave. Any thoughts on how I can resolve this? Thanks. See screen cap.\r\nCan you clarify what you mean by \"some of these\" ? Some videos ? Only some without the \"4K\" label ?\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, maybe you have some corrupted videos somehow (maybe a firewall that didn't allow the redirections ?). \r\n\r\nUse the \"Show in Finder\" button in cache Tab, look for a \"b2-1.mov\" for China 5. You can try opening it in Quicktime and see, filesize should be 116.2 MB. If you see .mov files that are way too small, try deleting them and redownloading anew ? Are you behind some kind of proxy or firewall ?\r\n\r\nThis is the link for that video : http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b2-1.mov\r\n\r\nIt should open and play in Safari, but note the many redirections (here it redirects to http://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b2-1.mov) > @glouel: 4K tags fixed! amazing! also, can I just ask, if I have the videos cached already, the preview will display them, correct? however, if I don't have them cached, I will get the screen you have above stating 'video previews are disabled'?\r\n\r\nThat's exactly it ! I'm not a native english speaker so if there are some suggestions on making the text clearer, I'm all for it :) > @glouel I shouldn't be, but switching networks seems to help. The ability to download them one at a time was a great idea for this type of issue. Thank you.\r\n\r\nGreat. Maybe as a future feature we could add some extra checks for that, I assume you saw .mov that were a few KB only, or something like that ? Awesome, I'll fix those consistency things tomorrow, thanks ! > 1. In the Main panel, change \"Preferred Video Format\" to \"Preferred video format\"\r\n> 4. In the Cache panel, change \"Cache Aerials As They Play\" to \"Cache Aerials [_or_ aerials] as they play\"\r\n\r\nSo, I went and had a look at english MacOS, indeed the rules seems to be : \r\n1) Labels and checkbox : only first word is capitalized\r\n2) Window titles, Buttons and Tab headers and dropdown menus : capitalize every major word (baring pronouns)\r\n\r\nSo I adjusted the checkboxes per your recommandations, and kept the buttons as they are. Also made a judgment call on keeping \"Visit Project Page\" as is, it's technically a button... although it looks like a label :)\r\n\r\nI also changed \"10 seconds\" to \"10 Seconds\" in the dropdown, and on Cache panel went for \"Total progress\" and \"Current video\" (I strongly considered adding \":\" at the end of those ?). I think that's pretty much it (and fixed the space before double ponctuation, french habit sorry !)\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, on french MacOS the capitalization rules aren't the same : \r\n1) That one stands\r\n2) Only first word are capitalized : \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-09 a 12 06 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46724666-c8b23a00-cc7a-11e8-9a08-4665f3e414f2.jpg)\r\n\r\n(See, title, buttons, dropdown) \r\nExcept... \r\n![capture d ecran 2018-10-10 a 10 55 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46725125-c7cdd800-cc7b-11e8-9ed1-6b577129cc84.png)\r\n\r\n\"Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences Clavier\" (Keyboard Preferences) somehow gets the reverse treatment. Localization consistency \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\n> 2. In the Main panel, change \"Play Different Aerial On Each Display\" to \"Play different Aerial [_or_ aerial] on each display\", thereby matching the capitalization on the other checkbox descriptions\r\n\r\nI went with Aerial(s)... It's /Aerials/ in the new urls so that swayed it for me. \r\n\r\n> 3. In the Time panel, change all four occurrences of \"MacOS\" to \"macOS\"\r\n\r\nI have to say that one physically hurts, but changed those too.\r\n\r\n> I'm inclined to think that the current error message \"Video preview streaming is disabled\" is sufficient, since the message should appear only if the user does not have the video cached.\r\n\r\nThe default for \"Never stream previews\" is off, so you'd have to explicitly check that box to see that message. So, yeah, should be straightforward enough.\r\n\r\nQuestion for you, would \"Preview streaming is disabled\" be grammatically better/less of a \"heavy turn of phrase\" as we'd say in french ?\r\n\r\nAnother question, in the menu below the list, I went with \"Check Only Cached\", \"Check Only 4K\". Somehow \"Check Cached Only\" sounds gross to me, but maybe that's correct ?\r\n\r\n> (Speaking as a writer and editor, I have to say that your English seems better than that of most of my fellow native English speakers!)\r\n\r\nThanks and many thanks for your feedback !\r\n\r\nbeta build here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta16/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n(and many thanks too to @dVIAN13 too for your testing, feedback and everything else) Thanks for all this, I shortened to \"Preview streaming is disabled\" (and couldn't agree more on intercaps !). \r\n\r\n@esetnik any objection on merging ?  @SeanMSmith can you check \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta17/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nI've implemented a better random through playlist, this should solve your issues (see my comment there https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/524#issuecomment-428871536 ). This also fixes a couple of startup bugs I saw on first launch experience.\r\n\r\nEdit : I merged it all so give 1.4 finale a shot;) Did some prolonged testing at 32x speed and looks good. You may get a one gaper after the playlist is exhausted (but not a straight repeat).\r\n\r\nTechnically after the playlist has been exhausted, I generated a new one, shuffled until it starts with something else than the last played one. I think that's a good enough compromise.  Apple no longer uses them on tvOS, so they don't appear in the tvOS12 JSON we are loading from their servers to show the videos. We'll try to bring them back soon, but they are only 1080p (which is probably why Apple no longer uses them).  Please give a try to this build (you may need to close/reopen System Preferences after install) : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta10/Aerial.saver.zip  Closing as fixed in release 1.4  This is available on latest beta, be aware that there are other changes though : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9\r\n  Again this is a pretty large merge, sorry about that, but many of these things were linked to each other. As discussed in this issue https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512, the primary purpose of this was to implement the displaying of the extended descriptions that are available with the tvOS 12 JSON that we are downloading. \r\n\r\nChanges : \r\n- Extra descriptions are now shown when available. Default to english with the option to localize (per my issue, there might be some displaying bugs in some non latin languages, but hard to get feedback from it, it will come soon enough when released I guess).\r\n- Added fade in/out on the videos themselves\r\n- Added preliminary detection for hardware acceleration support, and a better description based on latest findings (HEVC videos are encoded at Main10 profile which is not fully hardware accelerated pre 2017 Macs where the Intel iGPU is used)\r\n- Don't redownload the tvOS 12 .tar file if already present in cache directory per this discussion \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/509\r\n- Bypassing the VideoCache mecanism when the file is already fully cached. While it's a clever trick, it had a drawback of trying to assess the file duration, generating those error on console (and a 240 KB network request on every video) : \r\n`2018-10-01 20:17:53.633735+0200 AerialApp[10827:5184263] [] [20:17:53.634] curlh_lookupAndRetainRegisteredInfoForRequestIDOnQueue signalled err=-17374 (kFigCustomURLHandlerError_RequestingClientGone) (no requestingClient for this request) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia_frameworks/CoreMedia-2282.15/Sources/DataIO/CustomURLHandling/FigCustomURLHandling.c:1223`\r\nI think it also makes the video playback start slightly faster as a bonus. Haven't seen any network traffic since the fix.  \r\n- Implemented a \"Never Stream Videos\" option. Only cached videos will be used if any. \r\n- Brought back check/uncheck all option below the list\r\n- Some preparation for bringing back tvOS 10/11\r\n\r\nI might also forget some other stuff. I tentatively bumped this to 1.4, not sure if this should end up being a prerelease or not, since people keep creating issues about things that were fixed already. At the same time, some may be displeased by the missing tvOS 10/11 videos if released as an update. So I'm of two minds about this one :) Indeed working on fixing this ;) I don't mind a hand yes ! I was fixing the conflicts manually but that's not productive. I'm unsure how to rebase off JohnCoates/master as I had forked your fork. A bit stuck with the UI thanks ! Oh what a mess but I finally got it :) @esetnik I'll let you have a look to the merge, let me know about the version too. @esetnik found a last minute bug in the issue thread, it's a quick fix but I'll do it tomorrow ;) @esetnik Fixed the bug reported by @dVIAN13 here : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512#issuecomment-426366792\r\n\r\nGood to go on my end. I'll be temporarily pulling this, I expect to have a larger PR later today with a lot more features.   Yes, check the latest beta : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9\r\n\r\nExtended location as the ISS flies is still work in progress, see here if interested : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512   With tvOS12 (if you use the 1.4 beta), Apple no longer provides the day/night distinction, which is why we had to remove that information from the list on the left of the configuration sheet. \r\n\r\nWe're looking into adding that back at some point but until we have that, we can't do much more about either time or Dark Mode switching (which is a nice idea !).  Please try this build for both Dark Mode and by time day/night support : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta10/Aerial.saver.zip Closing as fixed in release 1.4  Closed as duplicate  Good catch !  Which version ? Try the latest beta, it fixes this : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9 If you don't see the version number in the bottom right corner of the pref pane, then you have the old one. The beta fixes the mojave bug. Closing as duplicate  One of the coolest thing about the new Space screensavers on tvOS12 is that by gently pressing the remote while they play, you can get detailed information about what the camera is flying over.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented by a set of timestamps and keys in the JSON, that are themselves referencing a localizedStrings bundle that is with the ressources.tar file that we now download in 1.4+. \r\n\r\nI've started implementing support to display those strings in lieu of the basic descriptions, but since those strings are localized (and will be displayed according to your MacOS locale), there are probably some text rendering issues (partially displayed, etc) in some languages that uses non latin characters.\r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-09-28 a 20 24 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46227478-a1489c80-c35f-11e8-804e-7b76eb6bf249.jpg)\r\n\r\nSo if you feel adventurous and want to help, I made a test build with that feature here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/test1.41b1/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAgain, this is a test build for those who want to help debug this. \r\n\r\nSome things of note : \r\n- All the descriptions show with a 2s fade in/fade out\r\n- If you set show for 10s, the new description will pop only for 10s with fade in/fade out. If you set always, the description will stay until replaced by the new one (with a fade out/fade in again which \"should\" be seamless)\r\n- Land videos have only one description for the whole duration. Space videos have multiple descriptions that can be spaced by as little as 10 seconds\r\n\r\nKnown issues : \r\n- The very last description will not fade out before the video gets cut\r\n- It's possible the string disappears before the end with show always, and a land video\r\n\r\nThose issues are linked to the fact that I'm currently not detecting the video duration. \r\n\r\nPlease report any issue you see in your locale with a description of the issue, your mac model, and possibly a screenshot of the issue you see if it hasn't been reported already. Many thanks in advance to those who will give it a shot.\r\n\r\nPS : Also new in this test build, I added some test to check for H.264/HEVC hardware decoding support in the popover: \r\n\r\n![capture d ecran 2018-09-28 a 21 01 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46228271-e1a91a00-c361-11e8-9945-b67c0f0a1b91.jpg)\r\n\r\n(new screenshots for the 1.4 readme)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-11 at 14 47 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46805565-ad702900-cd65-11e8-9779-91243ee9e634.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-11 at 14 49 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46805573-b3660a00-cd65-11e8-9e40-152d170ffd8e.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-11 at 14 50 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46805577-b5c86400-cd65-11e8-8c04-252c5fa6c1eb.png)\r\n Thanks for your feedback @dVIAN13.\r\n\r\nLatest build, some pretty nice changes :\r\n- Add video duration detection\r\n- Add fade in/fade out to videos\r\n- Add a shadow around text for better readability\r\n\r\nAlso fixes the transitions so they are smoother now. I think it's pretty good so barring any bug I'll make a PR out of it, I may add a \"English\" default for the localization that you can override, depending on feedback from i18n users if any.\r\n \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/test1.41b2/Aerial.saver.zip Thanks for the quick feedback, your link doesn't work though (says gone, maybe some permission issue). I'll try to have a look here, can you tell me what video format you are using ? And MacOS version.\r\n\r\nAbout streaming vs. cache, best way to tell if you have a doubt is with \"Activity monitor\" (may not be an accurate translation, what you use to see cpu usage). \r\n\r\nAbout streaming, basically, it should never stream if you have the files. But you may see some small data usage (about 240 KB in I think ?) which is a bug linked to how the cache is implemented, it's actually linked to the issue I had with duration detection, if you have local files, it will still try to read the video duration though the URL, online, which will fail as it thinks it can reuse a socket that's not there, if you build the test app you'll see curlh errors such as this : \r\n\r\n`2018-10-01 20:17:53.633735+0200 AerialApp[10827:5184263] [] [20:17:53.634] curlh_lookupAndRetainRegisteredInfoForRequestIDOnQueue signalled err=-17374 (kFigCustomURLHandlerError_RequestingClientGone) (no requestingClient for this request) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia_frameworks/CoreMedia-2282.15/Sources/DataIO/CustomURLHandling/FigCustomURLHandling.c:1223\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis one is not a new bug and something which is not an easy fix, considering how caching is implemented.\r\n\r\nChoppiness may be the memory thing, or too many video streams decoding simultaneously. Anyway, let me know if you can fix your video link.\r\n\r\nRegarding acceleration, even on my iMac with a dedicated GPU, MacOS is using the Intel QuickSync video decoding. So I doubt it's using an eGPU at all for this. QuickSync is a bunch of fixed functions units, not really \"gpu decoding\" so the lack of GPU power of Intel's iGPU is probably not to blame. I'd suggest you click the ? to make sure you see two green dots on HW acceleration. Also check cpu usage, CPU decoding would definitely cause choppiness on a laptop.  Quick feedback, I wasn't able to reproduce your memory issue so please try to clarify it.\r\n\r\nI did find something else that probably explains the chopinness issue for some. All of the SDR HEVC 1080p and 4K videos seem to be encoded with a Main10 profile and that's an issue at least on my machine. Skylake's Gen9's MFX doesn't fully decode HEVC Main10, so it's at best \"assisted\" or CPU decoded. \r\n\r\n![med-cap-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46312191-a4909200-c5c4-11e8-9c73-ab60f621a773.png)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if Apple uses the GPU assist at all for HEVC on Skylake on MacOS. \r\n\r\nIf I use either Quicktime or Aerial to play one of the 4K files, I see for one video playing a CPU load of 20-25% (pretty much 1 core maxed) approximately on my Core i5 6600 from the decoder task (VTDecoderXPCService). \r\n\r\n<img width=\"815\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-10-01 a 22 12 49\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46313078-38fbf400-c5c7-11e8-8ffb-3daf5fad4845.png\">\r\n\r\nIf I have multiple streams, that goes up quite fast and things start getting choppy. Same thing for 1080p HEVC although it's much lower, maybe 7%.\r\n\r\nIn your specific case, you have a Kaby Lake, so theoretically, that iteration of Quicksync should handle HEVC Main10 decoding through the MFX. Could you try to see, using QuickTime, if you see a higher CPU load playing one of the 4K videos with the decoder task ? \r\n\r\nVideo decoding acceleration seems to be pretty much a black box in AVPlayer, the closest thing I found is this property `preferredVideoDecoderGPURegistryID ` but Apple's documentation is... succinct : https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer/2942616-preferredvideodecodergpuregistry\r\n\r\nMaybe one can specify to use another GPU through that. \r\n\r\nIn this message https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-424744678, I assumed that MacOS prefers QuickSync when available over dGPU acceleration, which may or may not be correct. It's hard to know, really, and the function that lets you check if hardware acceleration is available (`VTIsHardwareDecodeSupported`) only seem to allow to check for codecs without a specific profile (and answers available on my iMac for HEVC) and not for the specifics (checking if Main10 decoding is available would help).  Thanks for your quick answer and the video !\r\n\r\nSo, the good news is that, at least on Kaby Lake+, 4K Main10 HEVC is hardware decoded, so that's a win :) I guess I should use the CPU generation to try and refine the HEVC detection. \r\n\r\nRegarding your issue, I think it has nothing to do with Aerial. Check this thread  : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7589928\r\n\r\nThat service you see (`com.apple.photos.ImageConversionService`) is the Photos/iCloud thing, it might be trying to upload/download your pictures to iCloud or maybe convert your JPEGs to HEIF. Maybe it pops because you're in the screensaver Preferences pane, and the service thinks it can then run (as I guess it does when the screensaver is running, so it's running because of the preview... maybe ? that's a weird Apple bug if so !). Maybe try another screensaver to see if you still see that service. \r\n\r\nRegarding the `VTDecoderXPCService`, using the same 4K LA video in quicktime here, I see about 410 MB of memory usage so in the same rough ballpark to yours. That's what you should see (and if you open the sheet, you may see more because of the 2nd \"preview\" which is not really a preview in the same sense).\r\n\r\nIn any case, try the pause thing suggested in that link, see if the service and choppiness disappears ? Please let me know about your issue @dVIAN13 \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, last test build as I think everything is now in shape to make a PR. What's new : \r\n- Better messages for hardware detection (still should be improved, but the APIs aren't helping)\r\n- Fixed cached videos generating online traffic \ud83c\udf89\r\n- Implemented \"Never Stream Videos\" mode\r\n- Brought back check/uncheck all menu (in preparation for tvOS10/11 adding, not sure why I removed it in the first place...)\r\n- Set default localized strings to english, you can still get localized strings through a checkbox\r\n\r\nBuild here : https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/test1.41b3/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n Oops looks like I messed up something, it doesn't load the json in your case. Just to give me a hint, is the tar/json in your Cache folder or not ? Ok thanks I'll have a look, sorry about that ! Just to be clear, closing and reopening System Preferences doesn't help ? Having a hard time reproducing right now. \r\n\r\nOne scenario I can think of is if you used a 1.2 version before installing that beta ? (which is a bug I definitely need to fix!). Try deleting the tar file if you can ? Can you delete the tar file and see if it loads correctly ? I think I know what's happening, definitely a bug on my end. That's still a good catch. One change I made is that I don't redownload the JSON all the time, and use the previously saved manifest if the tar is there, but that's not a good check at all if the saved manifest is from another JSON. Thanks for the report ! Closing as fixed in release 1.4  I think we need to update the project readme to reflect some of the changes. The top description mentions videos that are no longer available in the latest version. We should probably reflect that in some way (point people who want the new videos to latest versions, and those who want the old ones to the other one). \r\n\r\nI also think JohnCoates's twitter info is outdated.  I think there's still one issue I wanted to cleanup with this PR https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/511, apart from that I think it's probably good enough for a release although some people may be surprised that the old videos aren't there. I'll ask @esetnik and @JohnCoates their opinion on the matter.

Your machine lacks hardware accelerated HEVC decoding so the video is decoded by the CPU (hence the high load). Please try this version and let me know, if you use 1080p H264 it should fix your load issue : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-424407877  The first beta only had 4K support, then I added back 1080p. Because of that I kept it as default to avoid people redownloading videos.\r\n\r\nHowever I definitely agree, 1080p should probably even be the default for everyone (the whole 4K set takes 12.5 GB which may be an issue for a lot of people by itself).  \r\n\r\nSide note, the new videos (1080p and 4K) are all using HEVC instead of H264. H.264 is still available for 1080p but I haven't added the option to use them yet. HEVC has a pretty big size advantage. On older configurations, HEVC may be an issue. In your specific case, I guess you have a dedicated GPU on your MBP (that may handle 1080p HEVC but not 4K or not 3x 4K streams). Haswell's iGPU doesn't hw decode HEVC at all, so that's probably an issue that needs fixing too for those machines and older.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should probably detect if HEVC decoding is hardware accelerated or not too. In the case of Intel's iGPU, full HEVC decode starts with Skylake (2015). If you are using my builds from the other thread, check in the cache panel if you are using 4K. Some videos are grainy/blurry (especially space), some aren't. But if it's 4K, it should only use 4K. If you want to compare, you can go manually in the cache folder and check the videos. All the new ones you have downloaded should be ending in something like \"HEVC_4K.mov\" (you may also have some previous videos in that folder but they won't be used). 1080p shows as \"HEVC 2K\".\r\n\r\n Well, HEVC should still play on your Mac but it will be CPU decoded instead of GPU accelerated, so you may see high CPU load (see this issue https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/505 ) \r\n\r\nI've added a build here with 1080p H264 as default : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-424407877\r\n\r\nWe'll see what we can do about detection at a later point. @BreiteSeite I tried to investigate that a bit in that issue https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512#issuecomment-426052836\r\n\r\nIn your case, Late 2016, that's still a Skylake CPU so you only have \"semi\" accelerated HEVC decoding, because the videos are encoded in Main10 HEVC profile. \r\n\r\nAs for your Radeon Pro 455, in theory it should have HEVC 10 bit playback, whether it is used or not, I don't know. It may not be used at all, or because you have two gpus, only some of the time. I'd suggest as I did in the linked comment checking CPU usage when playing the same video on QuickTime, see what happens ? @BreiteSeite I'm not sure that 100% means it uses the GPU for decoding. The decoding is based on fixed function units, not on the GPU itself so it's hard to say what that GPU load is (I'm not sure what sensor is used). Note that the GPU itself doesn't have to be active in order for Intel's QuickSync to be used so forcing the discrete GPU may not affect MacOS's GVA video decoding. \r\n\r\nIn any case, you still have a fair bit of CPU load. I'd suggest you check with Activity Monitor, see what CPU load you have on VTDecoderXPCService with QuickTime, that would give us a good clue.  @BreiteSeite Thanks !\r\n\r\nSo I'd say it's definitely not fully GPU accelerated, and probably not playing through your Polaris UVD. I guess it uses Intel's QuickSync by default, your CPU load looks close to what I have on my iMac which also lacks Main10 decoding on QuickSync (and on my GPU). \r\n\r\nI did check the GPU load thing, and as I suspected, you see a \"GPU load\" just from the video playback itself (I guess from the buffers). Here's what I have with QuickSync \"assisted\" (but not complete) HEVC decoding : \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1129\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-10-02 a 20 01 38\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46367667-812a1d80-c67e-11e8-805e-d2f42adc3895.png\">\r\n\r\nIf you try a 1080p H.264 video you'll probably see VTDecoderXPCService below 5%. Or the same thing with a HEVC Main (8bit) video. \r\n\r\nIdeally for those machines (2015/2016), reencoding to 8bit would fix the issue. Bit of a mess ! Closing as fixed in release 1.4, we're still working on better detection in this issue : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/522  See here https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-423755801 # Fixed in 1.4b9 : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9  This is a followup to this PR https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/500 (originally based on @esetnik Feature/4k branch) with some extra changes/features : \r\n- updated to Swift 4.2/Xcode 10\r\n- switch (in cache panel) for 1080p/4K\r\n- Video description now shown (by default, configurable) bottom left of the screen for 10 seconds \r\n- added a version number at the bottom right of the panel I have not received maintainer permissions yet, but once I do I'll review this and merge asap. @glouel if it's not too much work can you also investigate the failing tests?

So I'd suggest we remove the categories completely since they don't make sense in the new JSON format. \r\n\r\nI love the idea of time-sensitive video playback options (this goes right along with the new theme of Mojave and their dynamic wallpapers. I agree that it might bother Apple if we were to hard-code a list of mapped entities, although we are already hard-coding their feed url so the additional mapping doesn't seem like a significant affront. I'd like to ship something that's reasonably easy to use for most people without any confusing interface or visual glitches. I think there's still a lot of work to be done to get to that point. So my opinion would be to hold off implementing any new functionality until we have a stronger base to work from. I think a simple and legible list of videos that can be enabled or disabled is good enough for most people. Agreed on all. I think you are right that since we already have the JSON hardcoded, it's not much more. We'll see that at a later point.\r\n\r\nShort term, I removed the day subcategory for now and I've resized the list to be a bit larger, I'm a bit puzzled by the height thing, but I'm sure I'll find it soon.\r\n\r\nI'll also push to this branch the H.264 support (see the last 2 issues opened about that for pre 2015 macs), I've added a popover to explain the video formats too. I'll commit as soon as I find that height thing ! So, I made the menu larger and moved the preview to the right, I think it look decent : \r\n<img width=\"671\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-09-25 a 17 59 46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46027066-3e4fcf00-c0ed-11e8-8376-c7792c452d86.png\">\r\n\r\nI've also changed the 1080p/4K radios for a popup, and added a popover for clarity. We can probably make that help text clearer but that's a good start I think : \r\n\r\n<img width=\"841\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-09-25 a 18 00 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46027129-63dcd880-c0ed-11e8-8fe4-74d635f1208d.png\">\r\n \r\n\r\n Side note, I think we can massively cleanup that Cache panel. But that's for another day. Wow, awesome job!  @JohnCoates @alistairmcmillan the project issues and PRs have gone unresolved for awhile. Are you willing to open up the project to an additional maintainer or two? Yes, happy to. Love the project and work on it when I have free time, but I'm definitely not doing it justice. Would @esetnik like to volunteer ? I can give a hand but I have little experience on github :)  Yes I\u2019d be happy to help out with the project. Sounds good ! I can also give a hand on handling issues, etc if needed. There are a few things that still need to be addressed so let us know @JohnCoates \r\n @johncoates where are we with this? I\u2019d love to be able to merge in #501 @JohnCoates seemed to have been away according to his twitter but he twitted yesterday. \r\n\r\nSo please come back to this thread @JohnCoates we really need to move on on this, I'm slightly tired of answering the many duplicate issues created for stuff I fixed already in builds that people don't see ;) @esetnik and @glouel I\u2019m happy to add you as maintainers. I\u2019m a fan of your contributions and you both seem dependable. Sounds good to me, many thanks ! \r\n\r\nThanks for the merge too, we might want to put up a new release up on this repo (and update the .md as I had tweaked it for my own fork, sorry about that !) Thanks @JohnCoates looking forward to helping out further with the project. Let me know when you've given us the maintainer permissions. Added both of you. I'll build a new release in a moment @glouel could you issue a release? My Xcode is stuck at 9 and my internet is 0.35 Mbps so it'll take about a year for me to update to the required OS and download Xcode 10 hah I was going to suggest it. Should I also sign it ?  Yeah, that would be great All done, and updated the readme with the correct link to it. Other parts of the readme should probably be updated too to reflect recent changes. \r\n\r\nI have to go right now but I'll have a look at closing duplicate issues later today.  This is based on @esetnik fork, modified to download the new tar file : https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/resources.tar\r\n\r\nIt downloads and untar the tar file to the cache directory. Json format slightly changed so accounted for that. Looks like I forked the wrong branch of his... my bad. I'll check his other changes and see what I can do, thanks for the heads up ! @glouel @kjg here's a list of improvements I made\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/422 I'll apply my changes to your correct branch and resubmit, sorry about that.  Fixed in 1.4b9 : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9  Fixed in 1.4b9 : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9  See here for a fix in the meantime : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-423932693 Fixed in 1.4b9 : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4beta9 Those videos have been replaced by Apple in their JSON with new ones (mostly the Space videos). Best guess, they weren't shot in 4K. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-424744678 for more on that. Please check the comment I linked about that. Short answer, maybe. @joshers2005 @glouel I see no reason why we can't merge both new and old lists to create a comprehensive set of all 4k assets. I'm not really concerned with even going as far as hard-coding the asset links instead of downloading a payload from Apple. I don't see what the difference is between hard-coding a payload link and hardcoding the media links. Also this would enable us to open up the UI to allow users to provide their own supplementary media links for any 4k content that's publicly available. We could even accept PRs for known good 4k content from third-party sources if we wanted to. My suggestion would be to create and commit our own manifest.json with a big array of media links that are tagged with the quality, format, description, features, etc. @esetnik  In that case, those are 1080p only. Cf my linked comment, the tvOS11 JSON (from your branch) only had 2 videos that weren't included already in the tvOS12 JSON we use now.  The idea to dynamically pull the media was based on the concept that apple changes the media list dynamically between tvOS releases. This has not been the case to my knowledge. Instead, each year they have changed the url / file type of the media list leading to breakage and extra work (like untarring). I think it\u2019s better we just create our own list of the assets themselves in the format Aerial best consumes. Have you checked this comment I made about exactly all of this ?  : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-424744678 > Have you checked this comment I made about exactly all of this ? :\r\n> [#463 (comment)](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/463#issuecomment-424744678)\r\n\r\n@glouel perfect!

I'm starting to blame the 10.13.6 AMD driver at this point ;) Please let me know if you keep seeing it in normal usage. Are you getting a black screen in preview ? This might be a different bug, see \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/548 Ok thank you very much, I'm reopening this to better track this ! Please report if you see in normal usage !  Preview had some unpredictible side effects in previous builds, also found a couple other bugs, but not sure if they are related. Here's a test build if you feel like giving it a shot : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThe distortion stuff may be 10.13.6 bug with the AMD drivers though (a lot seem fixed in Mojave per https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/472#issuecomment-430992470 although that may not be helpful to you).  Good to hear ! \r\n\r\nRegarding f.lux, I don't think  they have an API for this sadly, I tried looking for one but it doesn't look like they have one :( It's possible to calculate precisely those based on lat/long, maybe I'll add that at some point as a fallback for Macs without nightshift support if I can.  https://github.com/ceek/solar this looks like a good option for manually calculating them. \r\n\r\nThere's also a free (?) Yahoo Weather API I think which may be easier to use.  > For me, the latest version (v1.4.2test4) reintroduced the twitching of the screensaver (it continued to be present in the preview too). I've now downgraded to v1.4 again.\r\n\r\n@kerstin  Looks like my message to you yesterday was lost in the github bugs. 1.4.2test4 still had some pretty bad issues. I've fixed many things since in 1.4.2, maybe give it a shot : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2/Aerial.saver.zip > Thank you!! That worked perfectly, it's running on a very old (early 2011) macbook pro with the discrete card disabled, thank you so much for that most recent one! you're the best!!\r\n> \r\n> Also, is there any way you could hook into f.lux to determine the sunset/sunrise times? That would be dope :)\r\n\r\nSo as a workaround for machines without night shift, I started adding a manual calculation from coordinates, if you want to give it a shot try \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThere's a new mode in \"Time\" panel where you can enter your coordinates and it will calculate sunrise/set automatically for you.  @andsoitgoes Give 1.4.4 a try, final build was posted with a proper fallback for machines that don't handle night shift. \r\n\r\n@keikoro, let met know if you still experience issues by reopening.  Closing as duplicate of #464   Closing as duplicate of #464   Closing as duplicate of #464   I like that too but I'm not sure what kind of access we have to keyboard/trackpad.

Can you tell me what it gives you ?\r\n\r\n As far as I know this is fixed in 1.4.1, reopen otherwise Ok this really looks like a 10.13.6 bug then ! Thanks @gabel and @Fastjur for your feedback !  Side note related to this issue, there is also an issue with cached videos still making network requests (as mentioned in this issue https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512#issuecomment-426009013).\r\n\r\nI do have a workaround for that one. Working on a \"Never stream videos\" options right now. Closing as fixed with v1.4, there are now options to block streaming and full offline mode  Closing as duplicate of #464   @sdmactech Best guess this was probably caused by a file missing from the bundle lost during decompression of the ZIP file or the bundle being transferred from one drive to another. Best suggestion for a fix is to download a new copy.  Can users affected by this issue provide us with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Full hardware profile\r\n2. Results after testing with https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/501\r\n Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Closing as duplicate of #413   Closing as duplicate of #464   Closing as duplicate of #378   Just curious, has anyone reported this to Apple?  For those who would like to test it, I made a quick fork that parses the new files, it plays the 4K-SDR videos by default. Build here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4a2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n(edit with a new build, based on @esetnik 4k branch that included other fixes) Yes the Done button seems to be a Mojave issue, happened also with previous versions. I'll try to have a look tomorrow but not sure what happens there. See \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/494#issue-361903540 I investigated the Done button a bit but couldn't find anything particular, I assume it's another bug linked to Swift screensavers in Mojave, I'll try submitting a radar next week with a small sample project. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, pushed a new version with a few features : \r\n- 1080p and 4K support (you can switch in cache panel)\r\n- optional video description displayed (bottom left of the screen at video start\r\n- tweaked the path selector's color for dark mode in cache panel (was barely readable)\r\n\r\nBuild here : https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4b5/Aerial.saver.zip Hopefully we'll be able to merge changes when @JohnCoates names some extra mainteners. In the meantime, one last build, finally found the issue with the \"Done\" button not closing on Mojave. \r\n\r\nI ended up browsing all swift screensavers on github, found the answer on this project https://github.com/burnsra/SilhouetteSaver (which ironically doesn't work on Mojave) with an alternate way to dismiss the sheet \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\nBuild here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4b6/Aerial.saver.zip > @glouel when I try your latest release on Mojave I get a warning \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver on this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" Any ideas?\r\n> \r\n> Edit: Nevermind, tracked it down to #487\r\n\r\nTo be clear, does it work for you now ? It should work on the latest builds of Mojave. If not check the last paragraph on the project description for a workaround : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial So I'm putting one more beta here. This one addresses a couple of things, and is mostly for those who have Macs older than Late 2015 (see \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/505 ). If you install it on top of a previous beta, please go into Cache and set your Video Format to the one you wish to use to avoid redownloading videos. I set the default to 1080p H264 (the most compatible one). There's a help button with more info on what to use. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"841\" alt=\"capture d ecran 2018-09-25 a 18 00 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37544189/46027645-a81ca880-c0ee-11e8-801b-67721a7ec81c.png\">\r\n\r\nBuild here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4b7/Aerial.saver.zip  > @glouel Feature request - would it be possible to optionally allow the video description to remain showing rather than fading off after a few seconds please?

This particular video isn't available in H264 in the JSON, only in HEVC, and because of the internals of the video list, I had to remove it for everyone (can't have a video missing for one format).\r\n- I have a branch that brings back tvOS11 4K screensavers. Sad thing is, and I should have checked before... they are nearly all in the tvOS12 JSON already \ud83d\ude05 There's one desert video (and I don't remember the other one) that aren't included in the tvOS12 JSON. Because it was a quick hack and it didn't bring much, I didn't push that branch. If the video list gets fixed (see above), we could also add back the tvOS10 videos (the originals). Those are 1080p H264 only though.\r\n- I'm pretty sure that even on my Late 2015 iMac 5K (Intel Skylake with AMD GPU), AVKit uses Intel's iGPU fixed function hw decoding (aka QuickSync) for H264, as I saw this on the console : \r\n`GVA info: Successfully connected to the Intel plugin, offline Gen9 `\r\nI assume it is also used for HEVC too in my case (although I didn't see any such message on console).  \r\n- Some discrete AMD GPUs also have H.264 and HEVC decoding, but not all of them. In my case (M2XX, Tonga), that generation only has UVD 5.0 with H.264 hw decoding, but not HEVC. HEVC came with Polaris (the 400/500 series on laptops). \r\n- Knowing what gets used will probably be pretty important in order to track bugs/crashes in the future (see https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/468 which I couldn't reproduce after a few hours of playback on my very old Sandy Bridge 2011 Macbook Air). I don't know if we can know either what is available, or what is used through an API, or if we'll have to do guesswork. Some interesting cases would be the iMac Pro (no IGP, but modern AMD GPU with H.264/HEVC decoding, which I assume is used there) or the old Mac Pros (no IGP, probably only H.264 decoding ?). \r\n- I'm pretty sure we're streaming when we shouldn't, probably on the control panel. There were a few issues raised about that, I think some cleanup around that is needed. I also added a (hidden/non implemented) checkbox to disable all streaming.\r\n- Full Offline mode should be easy to add, but will need some serious rejiggering of the manifestloader though. \r\n- A priority imo should be to stop downloading the tar/JSON all the time. We should check it weekly/monthly at best (we can give the choice through a pref). \r\n- A fade in/out for videos would be coo tool, someone had a patch but ran into some issues, mostly because in order to implement the fade out, you need accurate duration for the video. This is the kind of thing that may have been fixed in later versions of AVKit/MacOS and will need to be investigated more. \r\n- We talked with @esetnik about what would be needed for bringing back day/night, and show day/night videos depending on current time (a bit like the dynamic wallpapers on Mojave). That will probably come later though.   > Sorry but I don't have the \"always\" option next to \"show descriptions\" :-(\r\n\r\nIt's in beta 8 : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4b8/Aerial.saver.zip @vichudson1 that's a really good point considering this is after all a \"screen saver\" and shouldn't by definition be causing any additional burn in or uneven wear. Ideally, there's a string bundle with the extra descriptions that are shown on the Apple TV. That's one thing I didn't put on my big post up there, it would be a \"nice to have\" to be able to display those (there's a timecode and a string to be displayed at specific times). I haven't looked into it yet.\r\n\r\nMoving the description in the meantime sounds good to me. Maybe something \"subtle\" like moving from one corner to another every minute or so ?\r\n\r\nSide note, starting with 10.13, we can detect if HEVC/H.264 hw acceleration is available, but it doesn't give any detail on the method used. Still better than nothing. \r\n\r\n(Edit: still a bit of work but I got the basic localized string thing working. I'll try to have a beta for it soon) Thanks to @JohnCoates I pushed the latest build in this repository, you can find it in the releases. Only difference with my own 1.4beta9 build is that this one is signed, should be easier for everyone \ud83c\udf89  If you have a minute check this issue for a test version with the extended descriptions for the space videos : \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/512  Could either of you add a screenshot to show what you are experiencing? Since we are using System video playback with Aerial, many of these kinds of bugs may be linked to a specific version of MacOS. \r\n\r\nTo those who still had issues, could you please recheck with version 1.4, and if you still see issues, give us which MacOS version you are using and any details that may help reproduce ?  Thanks for your feedback and OS details, this will be helpful ! Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Closing as duplicate of #58   Are you perhaps behind firewalls or proxy systems that might be blocking your access to Apple's CDN servers?  This is a bit old but closing too as fixed in 1.4, we have full offline mode now (see the project readme)  @ZackNoyes thanks for this, I manually merged the changes in next branch as things as diverged a lot since then, it will be in 1.4.2 beta2.   This should be fixed in V1.4, you can now disable streaming and cache videos individually.  Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Closing as duplicate of #58   Implemented in 1.4 !  Five months later, no reply... closing.  This is now implemented in 1.4, see the Offline mode section in the main project readme !

I am running with external monitor (1920x1200) as main display and laptop screen at 1280x800 equivalent. Main display alternates between full screen and black bars on top and bottom. Laptop screen always has black bars. High Sierra 10.13.6.\r\n\r\nOk thanks for your feedback, I reopened this and will try and look into it. Can you tell me : \r\n\r\n- Mac model \r\n- Preferred video format \r\n- do you see the exact same thing when using the 3 multimonitor mode (main only, mirror, individual) \r\n\r\nThanks > * MacBook Pro 13, 2017, Touch Bar\r\n> * 1080p H264 (tried playing HEVC, got high CPU usage on this machine)\r\n> \r\n> In mirrored mode: what I described before: alternating on main display, letterboxed on laptop screen. Also noticed lag between screens (videos not synchronized)\r\n> In \"only main display\" mode: top/bottom flicker a few times, then settles on playing full screen\r\n> In \"different mode\": on both display top and bottom flickers, then plays full screen.\r\n\r\nOk thanks for this, I'll try to replicate. \r\n\r\n> I also tried unplugging the monitor and playing with laptop screen only.

Can you try using the screensaver with the monitor unplugged first (stay in scaled mode) and tell me what that does ? I'll get back to you tommorrow on  this, thanks ! > Unfortunately, it is still a problem for me in 1.4.1. I am running with external monitor (1920x1200) as main display and laptop screen at 1280x800 equivalent. Main display alternates between full screen and black bars on top and bottom. Laptop screen always has black bars. High Sierra 10.13.6.\r\n\r\nSo I'm gonna need some clarifications because I'm unable to replicate: \r\n- What do you mean by external monitor \"as main display\" ? As far as I know, there's no such setting to say which display is \"main\" ? \r\n- Are you running external non scaled, at 1920x1200, and  internal scaled at 1280x800 ? Or is external scaled too ?\r\n\r\nScreenshots of your precise config would help. \r\n\r\nOn my Macbook Air with 10.13.6, setting internal scaled at 1280x800, and external non scaled at 1920x1200, everything is ok in mirrored mode and I haven't been able to replicate by messing with scaling on both. I also tried vertical mode and it's all good. \r\n\r\nEither there's something I don't get about your settings, or there's something driver related that is different on your machine compared to mine. \r\n\r\nIt's a long shot but I made a build with expanded logging here: \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nCan you install (then quit System Preferences and launch again), go to the Aerial tab, enable debug mode AND log to disk, then close it, And launch the screensaver. If you see black bars or whatever, go to Aerial cache folder and attach the AerialLog.txt ? Oh, that's a pretty well hidden setting ! Thanks for clarification. \r\n\r\nso @eozh same thing here setting external as main, let me know about the other stuff thanks ! @dVIAN13 Ha thanks for this. Indeed it could be scaling to non widescreen ratio, although I don't think I saw that option, hmm. With extended logs from the new build we should get exactly what's sent to Aerial so that can give us a clue !\r\n\r\nTo try and narrow it down, and sorry because I think I've asked you already, are you running Mojave, and Mac model ? \r\n\r\n > That's correct. It's a little bit more complicates, since unlike your Air, the Pro display is retina. If I recall correctly, it used to be 2x of 1280x800 (2560x1600). In Sierra or so, they switched the default to look like 1440x900, which looks too small to me, so I keep it in the 1280x800 mode. \r\n\r\nYeah sadly the MBA is the only Mac I have on 10.13.6. Totally understandable about font size ! \r\n\r\n> I checked and the same issue happens in the default mode of the internal display.\r\n\r\nOk so scaled doesn't make a difference ? hmm... I was going to say I was going to do more testing on scaling on my iMac (on mojave unfortunately) but that might not help. I'll let you know tomorrow. \r\n\r\n> Attached are the screenshots and the log file. Let me know if I can do anything else to help you reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThanks for doing this !\r\n\r\nAccording to the logs, you don't have videos cached (maybe a few only) but that should not matter. \r\n\r\n2:43:18 PM : setting up player layer with frame: (0.0, 0.0, 1920.0, 1200.0) / (0.0, 0.0, 1920.0, 1200.0)\r\n2:43:18 PM : setting up player layer with frame: (0.0, 0.0, 1280.0, 800.0) / (-1280.0, 0.0, 1280.0, 800.0)\r\n\r\nThose are the two lines I was really hoping to see, so according to them, it seems to detect the screen sizes correctly (and your external screen is on the right if I read that right). \r\n\r\nOne thing does come to mind : I may have a bug if the main screen is not retina and the 2nd is. Would it be a lot of trouble for you to switch temporarily the main screen to internal just to see ? I think the other way around may be fine (retina main, non retina external) but maybe not the other way around ?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, very long shot but I did a quick build with retina detection disabled on main screen. Maybe that will help : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test3/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for helping me figuring this out ! Please note that some people had that bug fixed for them on Mojave : https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/472#issuecomment-430992470\r\n\r\nStill, I did try some more stuff today, here's my latest test build if you want to give it a shot. It has proper per screen retina detection and better player start synchronisation. It may not help you but who knows. Out of that, I think I'm out of ideas for you, sorry. \r\n\r\nBuild here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test4/Aerial.saver.zip Yep you really need to restart syspref ! Macos bug as far as I know on this one :( \r\nOfficially, Apple's documentation still says that Screensavers should be written in Objective-C (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/screensaver/screensaverview although the docs show swift apis \ud83d\ude31) and the Screensaver sample is still not available in swift in xcode. I guess they know there are still some bugs.   > test4 version didn't help, but I found some more information:\r\n> \r\n> * when there are black bars at the top and bottom, the video is also cropped horizontally. It's easy to see on the LA Airport video, where the left taxiway is off-screen.\r\n> * In the \"separate\" mode, the videos have similar problems for a second and then go to correct view.\r\n> * interestingly, the problem **goes away** when I set a non-zero fade duration and the video has been cached.\r\n\r\nInteresting ! Was all that with test 4 ? \r\n\r\n> I briefly looked at the code, and although I don't understand it completely, I think it may have something to do with \"readyForDisplay\" observer and shared views. Timing of the player creation (cached vs. online) might also play a role.\r\n\r\nI would highly suggest you cache videos. I did fix many issues regarding player creation and it's start specifically in test 4, but it's not on this repo. My branch is here if you are curious : https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/blob/feature/v1.4.2/Aerial/Source/Views/AerialView.swift\r\n\r\nOn old versions the playback was started before the view was properly ready but that may not make that much of a difference. But the ready for display thing is interesting, indeed with streaming it may still start too early. I did a quick build pushing back the play in the rdf observer, it may break things like play a 2nd video but hey, who knows ? Let me know if you're willing to give it a shot : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test6/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\n > Same thing in test4 and test6.\r\n\r\nOk...\r\n\r\n> Also, if the video is not cached it often just shows black screen.\r\n\r\nYou mean at cold startup with a cached video, or swapping from cached to non cached maybe ? I suppose you don't see any text either. \r\n\r\n> These issues didn't happen in the versions before 1.4. But I am glad I found a workaround: having it cached + fade in.\r\n\r\nCache + fades are slightly linked. If a video is not cached, we usually have no idea of it's duration, so we can't put any fades and just bring opacity to 1. \r\n\r\nThat you have an issue with cache and NO fade is weird though. I'll try rejiggering stuff again \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  > > Also, if the video is not cached it often just shows black screen.\r\n> \r\n> You mean at cold startup with a cached video, or swapping from cached to non cached maybe ? I suppose you don't see any text either.\r\n\r\nOk so this one I reproduced. Sometimes the server just seem to leave the connection hanging, I need to better handle that case. This one is not new, it's just Apple's CDN misbehaving, I had the same issue in Safari too (maybe there's something weird though but this is stuff I haven't touched so far, checking...)\r\n\r\nEdit : Things I looked at : \r\n- forcing redirection to the final CDN url -> no change\r\n- maybe it's the old video server only (phobos) -> same issue on new one (sylvia)\r\n\r\nWhat happens : for some reason sometimes, we only get one data response of 100kb and nothing else, it just stops there.  One thing I noticed in safari, you can see a tiny image preview before it loads the video, is it linked to that ? I think that we're missing something in our VideoLoader to detect something related to streaming but I have no idea what. I'll put this on hold for now but I'll try to get back to it. Please use cached videos in the meantime. This is driving me slightly crazy so still looking at it. Maybe getting close. So we seem to be getting an arbitrary amount of data. The data seems identical, sometimes we only get a few KB and everything is great : \r\n\r\n15:29:49 : Starting request: <NSMutableURLRequest: 0x600000018060> { URL: https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LW_L001_C006_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov }\r\n15:29:49 : Received data with length: 16031\r\n\r\nSometimes we get more and everything borks : \r\n\r\n15:39:34 : Starting request: <NSMutableURLRequest: 0x600000012600> { URL: https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LW_L001_C006_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov }\r\n15:39:34 : Received data with length: 712046\r\n\r\nIt looks like the beggining of a mpeg 4 stream according to mediainfo so I'm assuming the data is good, we just get more than we can handle. In a C world I would have bet on a too small buffer but hmm... Will keep checking.  And I got it. Two requests are made simultaneously by Apple's AVAssetResourceLoader, the contentRequest and the dataRequest. The first one tells what type of file it is, the second brings the data. That first amount of request data gets cached while it probably shouldn't, and that messed the whole thing and subsequent request (for the rest of the data) weren't sent anymore. Anyway, fixed it by disabling some \"extra\" cache mechanism that tried to fullfill that request while it shouldn't (it would have been useful if we were scrubbing for example but since we don't, it's useless). \r\n\r\nCache Aerials as they play still works correctly, and as soon as you play through a video it's persisted to disk and then you're in the \"good path\". \r\n\r\nWill that fix all your bugs, I don't know, but at least streaming is correctly working again and you should never see those black screen while streaming anymore. I'll post a build soonish. Build here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test7/Aerial.saver.zip Is it any less at least ? It seemed rock solid here, damn ! I did 99% of my testing on the new server, maybe there's something else on the old one, will check this weekend if I have a sec. > I gave up on streaming and cached the enabled videos, not that there is a nice GUI for it. \r\n\r\nI definitely understand. You mean download checked in the menu below the list ? Cause that's there ;)\r\n\r\n> The other unfortunate thing I noticed is that video looks a little jerky on external display. Not sure if it is related to scaling or sharing the video player.\r\n\r\nThat's weird. You're running external as main right ? Can you define \"jerky\" ? Right now  the scaling should be correct per screen so probably not that. Does it really look better when you have 2 different videos (assuming same quality, it varies a lot). Sharing the player, as far as I know, that shouldn't matter as they have different CALayers for the rendering which are set with correct scaling. But If you really see a difference I can try and make a version that doesn't share to see... > Mis-typed, should read as \"now that there is a nice GUI for it\"\r\n\r\nHehe no problem ;)\r\n\r\n> It is hard to define. The motion doesn't look smooth, where things are moving fast, like waves in Hawaii. It look like judder from either skipped frames or mis-matched frame rate. It is subtle though. I don't see a difference in the 2 videos mode.\r\n\r\nWell, if you don't see a difference between mirrored and independant then it's not the shared thing. 2017 should have HEVC Main10 so probably not that either. \r\n\r\nI would suggest you check the videos with quicktime, some can look truly poorly encoded or have lower resolution that we'd think. \r\n\r\nOne example is comp_GMT026_363A_103NC_E1027_KOREA_JAPAN_NIGHT_v17_SDR_FINAL_25062018_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov (same in any format)\r\n\r\nIf you look at the very bottom of the screen, near the right corner (maybe 20% to the left of it), you'll see a patch of earth that's not moving at the very beggining of the video for mabye 2-3 secs before it \"sticks itself\" in the right place as the earth rotate. If you see a quality disparity between Aerial and Quicktime on the same screen then it's an issue !   Will mark this as fixed in 1.4.2, feel free to reopen if you still experience issues.   You can now do that by editing the JSONs if that's your thing. There are also other screensaver more apt to this so closing ;)  Closing as duplicate of #377   Duplicate of #377   Try going into the settings and downloading all the videos through the Cache settings.  Best solution is to make sure you are using [the latest release](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases) and cache the videos though the VPN.  This should no longer happen in 1.4, please give it a shot.   To those who still experience lag issues, can you give this build a try : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1test4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThis should fix issues in 10.13 particularly (10.14 seemed ok in stable 1.4). Also note that iCloud Photos sync can launch while your screensaver runs, part of it is a file converting service (JPEG to HEIF I guess, probably videos too) which can make video playback massively lag.  @dubyasqrd \r\nFirst, can you try latest version ? See here : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nA few issues have been fixed since that beta including that may have contributed to choppiness (especially if you streamed videos). \r\n\r\nThen, if it's still choppy, will need more details: \r\n- Is it always choppy from the start or just gets choppy at some point ?\r\n- Are videos cached ? \r\n- Multimonitor ? If so which mode ?\r\n- Are you using 1080p H264 as prefered video format ?\r\n\r\nOne other factor, iCloud Photo Syncing can start when the screensaver is on and slow down massively video playback, that's described in the troubleshooting section.

They are listed in this file: http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\r\n\r\nBTW Apple could produce higher resolution videos, but keep in mind (if you check other issues that people have logged here) people are already unhappy about the size of the existing files. @chriscalo You're not the first to suggest this. Last time it was suggested the Apple TV was getting videos that the screensaver wasn't I investigated thoroughly.\r\n\r\nSet up a shared net connection on my Mac, hooked my Apple TV up to it, factory reset my Apple TV and used Wireshark to inspect all the traffic between the Apple TV and and the internet to watch for the source of the aerial videos and the actual files themselves. Nothing has changed. They are still pulling their videos from the JSON file linked above.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, another way we know they are still pulling videos from this JSON file is because when they added new videos in December last year they just added them to the same file. Since they started showing these files with the introduction of the fourth generation Apple TV they haven't changed the source JSON file.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the Apple TV can only output 1080p. So technically, the videos you are seeing outputted by your Apple TV can't be any higher resolution. https://www.apple.com/apple-tv/specs/ @chriscalo I can't answer why there is lower image quality on your iMac compared to your TV. I'd need to know makes and models, and mostly likely see for myself. I can take a guess though.\r\n\r\nDo you have a 4K or 5K TV by any chance? If so then, given the dearth of 4K/5K content out there, isn't the TV designed to regular upscale content and make it look good? Won't that be one of its primary selling features? I just did a search for 4K TVs on Amazon, picked the first result and the first listed feature says \"...and lift your standard definition content to near 4K quality via LG's six step 4K upscaler\"\r\n\r\nSo, in short, yeah, you're right. Your TV is a magician! :)  1) Select Aerial\r\n2) Close System Preferences\r\n3) Re-open System Preferences\r\n\r\nIt's a bug in macOS.

I was thrown off because I'm using my own custom version, and because the timestamps in the release version seem to be 2015 even though the update was released in 2016.\r\n\r\nThe two official recommended ways to install are the two listed in the [README](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Readme.md) file. Don't use the version in the master.zip it's in development and may or may not be complete or tested. @MichaelDimmitt Yup, John designed Aerial to automatically pick up new videos when Apple release them. Which it did a few months ago successfully for everyone when Apple released the new videos of Dubai and Greenland, etc.  @adilmajid It's a bug in macOS. Select Aerial, close System Preferences, re-open System Preferences works. Try it and let us know how you get on. @andyyh1214 Select Aerial, close System Preferences, re-open System Preferences works. Try it and let us know how you get on.  @alyx92 If pressing the spacebar pauses one of the videos, then it means you are running quite an old version. This was basically a bug that John fixed back in October 2015.\r\n\r\nPlease try the latest version...\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2  This was actually fixed in 1.4 :)  Firstly this is John's screensaver. I just help/annoy people that log issues. :)\r\n\r\nThat aside I don't really get the benefit to users here.\r\n\r\nYou want to add something to Aerial that makes it set itself as the default screensaver whenever it runs? @MichaelDimmitt I'm still not understanding the benefit. Are you saying the screensaver itself should run these commands to make itself the default, or that users should run these commands after downloading Aerial? @MichaelDimmitt But when is the screensaver going to run so it can make itself the default, if it isn't already the default?\r\n\r\nThis is what I mean. Right now the situation is...\r\n\r\n1) User downloads Aerial\r\n2) First time they click on the downloaded Aerial.saver file, macOS launches System Preferences, installs Aerial and sets it at the default.\r\n3) There is no step 3 :)\r\n @MichaelDimmitt Are you sure making a screensaver the default is another step? Try deleting Aerial from a Mac and installing again. On my Macs the first time I open a new screensaver and macOS launches it in System Preferences, it is automatically selected as the default. 1. Delete Aerial from everywhere\r\n2. Close System Preferences\r\n3. Download and open Aerial which launches System Preferences and makes Aerial the default\r\n\r\nHowever, if you open System Preferences and select another screensaver, and then launch Aerial while that other screensaver is running, then Aerial will get added to the list but not made the default.\r\n\r\nBut if we added these commands to Aerial to tell it to set itself as the default, you still need it to run for those commands to take effect. How do you do that? By selecting it. At which point you have already made it the default, so the commands don't make any difference.\r\n\r\nYou see what I mean? To get the thing to run the user has to take an action. That action makes Aerial the default. So there is no point to the commands.\r\n\r\nAND about the \"You cannot use...\" bug. The reason people see that bug is because macOS cannot run the screensaver. If the screensaver is not running, then it can't run commands to make itself default.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense, this is difficult to explain. The only way for those commands to work is for the screensaver to actually be running, and I can't see a situation where the screensaver would be running where it wasn't already the selected default.  @brown921 Make sure you have the latest version installed. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2\r\n\r\nIt should automatically cache the videos. But check in the screensaver preferences to make sure caching is ticked.\r\n\r\nOnce the videos are downloaded it won't use any more of your bandwidth. Until Apple release more videos. Which they've only done once in the last two years.\r\n\r\nBTW The brew version and the one you manually install are identical. It's just two different methods to install the same thing.  @vonkas The videos are produced by Apple. If you want higher resolution sharper videos you'll need to speak to them. :) But then if they are higher resolution and sharper then the file sizes will be bigger. Much bigger. :(\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can try swapping them out with the videos available here though.\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/257  @mzdhr @flamerock \r\n\r\n1) Select Aerial in System Preferences.\r\n2) Close System Preferences.\r\n3) Re-open System Preferences.\r\n\r\nThe error should now be gone.\r\n\r\nIf you still see the error please let me know. If you are curious why this is happening, it's a bug in macOS caused by multiple different versions of the Swift libraries. You can read more about it here.\r\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\r\n\r\nIt was reported to Apple over a year ago. They still haven't fixed it.  @Vxider John's screensaver just displays the videos that Apple created for their Apple TV screensaver. If Apple starts to stream 4K aerial videos to the Apple TV, then John's screensaver will automatically pick them up. Closing as 4K video will be supported automatically if Apple ever released any 4K videos.  Implemented in 1.4 !  Hi @fpaludo,\r\n\r\nThe screensaver already works this way.\r\n\r\n1) Select the videos you want downloaded. Leave the default \"Cache Aerials As They Play\" box ticked.\r\n2) Let the screensaver run.\r\n3) There is no step three.\r\n\r\nThe screensaver will only download the ones that you have selected.\r\n\r\nI just tested this myself on a new Mac just to confirm. Ticked six videos at random, left the screensaver running over night, and it's only downloaded the six videos I ticked. You can now download videos individually in 1.4, or download what you selected using the menu below the video list.  Duplicate of #11   Closing as duplicate of #278   Which version of Aerial are you running? Are you running the latest version from [here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2)? If you have any other versions installed, please remove them.\r\n\r\nDo you have the videos cached? I have the same MacBook. I tried leaving the screensaver running for hours last night. The fans never came on once.\r\n\r\nThere is a missing piece to this puzzle. Do you have external monitors connected? If you try to run the videos in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Aerial` full screen in QuickTime do the fans come on? The videos definitely don't stay in memory. I tested that recently for another issue. :)\r\n\r\nTry disconnecting the external monitor and running the screensaver. See if the fans come on then. @iberras I ask before but you never answered. If you run the screensaver without your external monitor plugged in do the fans still come on? I know it's been a while but could you check with V1.4 maybe ? Just so you know, another thing that may slow down video playback is iCloud Photo syncing, see the troubleshooting paragraph at the bottom of the project readme, we had someone report that earlier.   @shaguib There is a bug in macOS. It has been reported to Apple, but they haven't fixed it.\r\n\r\nBut there is an easy workaround.\r\n\r\n1) Select Aerial in System Preferences. You may see that error message.\r\n2) Close System Preferences with Aerial still selected.\r\n3) Re-open System Preferences. You shouldn't see the error message.\r\n\r\nPlease try this and let us know how you get on.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the bug here. http://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html @curiopraxis Did you definitely close System Preferences with Aerial selected and then reopen it? If so there are some other steps I'd like to you try to try to establish what is causing this error. No reply from @shaguib or @curiopraxis. Closing. @djroed  We know exactly why this error is being caused. It isn't a mystery. There is a bug in macOS.\r\n\r\nWhen you load a screensaver that is written using Swift, System Preferences loads the Swift libraries into its process. Unfortunately there are multiple copies of the Swift libraries for each release of Swift. And System Preferences will only load one set of the libraries at a time.\r\n\r\nSo if you open System Preferences with a screensaver selected that needs version 1 of the Swift libraries then System Preferences will load version 1 of the libraries, but if you select a screensaver that needs another version of the libraries you will get the error saying \"You cannot use the ... screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\"\r\n\r\nThe only way to get System Preferences to load a different version of the libraries is to close it and start again. But to make sure it loads the correct version of the libraries needed by Aerial, you need to open it with Aerial selected or another screensaver that uses the same version of the libraries.\r\n\r\nThis is what you must have done. The \"another screen saver\" you mention must use the same version of the libraries that Aerial uses. So when you selected Aerial the correct version was loaded.\r\n\r\nThe bug has been reported to Apple. The rdar number is 25569037. It is now one year and three weeks old. And that's why my instructions ended with \"Please try this and let us know how you get on.\" So that if it doesn't work I can try to help people figure out why. :)\r\n\r\nYou are right a few people try this and it doesn't work. My best guess is that if it doesn't work then something else is loading the Swift libraries into the System Preferences process and not just a screensaver.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to confirm if this is what is happening, and even work out what is doing it. If someone follows the instructions I posted above and STILL gets the \"Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" message, then they just need to...\r\n\r\n1) Open Activity Monitor with SystemPreferences still showing the error\r\n2) Select the SystemPreferences process\r\n3) Click the Information button\r\n4) Select the \"Open Files and Ports\" tab\r\n5) Copy the files and ports information into a text editor (there will be a LOT of files listed) and search for \"libswift\". This will show where the Swift libraries are being loaded from. It will look something like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/MacOS/iOS Saver\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftAppKit.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftCoreGraphics.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftDarwin.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftDispatch.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftFoundation.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftObjectiveC.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftQuartzCore.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n/Users/alistair/Library/Screen Savers/iOS Saver.saver/Contents/Frameworks/libswiftSecurity.dylib\r\ntxt\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively they can copy and paste that info from the \"Open file and ports\" tab and send it to alistairmcmillan75@gmail.com and I'll look through it myself to work out what is causing the issue.

Usually though the screensaver doesn't crash when its blocked by a firewall. Usually the videos just don't appear. Strange that the firewall is convincing Aerial that it is trying to download a 18446744074 GB file.\r\n\r\nCould you tell us which firewall it is? Or show us the error you get in the browser? @kudigaracoder Thanks.\r\n\r\nIf you're unable to get those URLs whitelisted, or get the file type unblocked which seems to be what its objecting to, you could try caching the videos on another network if you're on a laptop or on another machine and transfer them over if you're on a desktop.

As far as it goes, when you click a video that's not in cache already, it will start streaming it (not downloading the whole thing).

It's possible to have multiple copies installed which just confuses things.\r\n\r\nIf it still comes up with no list like that then most likely either (a) you are being blocked from talking to Apple's servers by a firewall or corporate proxy or something like that, or (b) something is corrupting the screen saver install. @gomflo Do you have the latest version installed? Have you tried caching the files? @robhuska If you let all the videos cache on your home network, then the screensaver should play fine at work. John designed it to essentially automatically work offline if the videos are cached and it can't find the network.  Closing as duplicate of #278   Most likely you are getting this because the screensaver has been blocked from talking to Apple's servers. That's where it gets the videos and crucially the file that lists the videos.\r\n\r\nIf you have a local firewall like Little Snitch check that it hasn't blocked the screensaver.\r\n\r\nIf you are behind a corporate proxy/firewall it might have blocked the screensaver. In that case if you can connect your Mac (assuming it is a portable) to another network, you can cache all the files from the \"Cache\" tab and it'll run essentially in offline mode on your corporate network. @iahu Are you behind a firewall or corporate proxy or something? If Aerial is being blocked by something out-with your control then the browser might be blocked too.\r\n\r\nCan you get to http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json in a browser? @iahu So what happens if you try one of the links in that file? For example http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\n\r\nDo you see the movie play in your browser? @iahu Try deleting the screensaver and installing a fresh copy from [here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases). Some times the Aerial.saver file can get corrupted.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, if you are on a MacBook, try connecting it to another network (like your home network) and caching the files through that. Once the data is caching it should run quite happily without network access.  Closing as duplicate of #278   @andygoldberg94 Are you using the latest version? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\r\n\r\nHave you cached the videos?  I've never seen this before but I'm curious.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to go back to the store, open System Preferences, select the \"Desktop & Screen Saver\" tab and if it is a fork of John's screen saver see if whoever created it has updated the \"Visit Project Page\" to point to their project.\r\n\r\nOr ask the people in the store where they found it.\r\n\r\nEither way, let us know. :) @Benexplorer @Dimatellis Interesting. If someone could get a movie capture of this in operation myself, and I'm sure others too, would be curious to see it.  @fintanstevens Please select Aerial, close System Preferences, re-open System Preferences, the screen saver preview should now work.\r\n\r\nLet us know how you get on.

A few people have already suggested this. So closing this as a duplicate of #58 .\r\n\r\nGood news is that someone has already submitted an implementation of this idea. #285   We now have version number on the bottom right corner with 1.4 ! @WebVeteran Can you close System Preferences and open it again ? It doesn't reload the new version correctly if you don't usually.  Are you using a Windows machine or a Mac?\r\n\r\nIf you are using a Mac, make sure you have the [latest version of Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases) and you can change the cache location in the Screen Saver Options.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-01-03 10 15 28\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/125896/21605059/86bf5dea-d19e-11e6-8e2e-641042650aef.png\">\r\n\r\nIf you are using a Windows machine, then unfortunately that version of the screensaver (which is hosted over here https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/) hasn't been updated to allow that yet. This was about the Windows version. Closing.  Already suggested under #58 and there is a depending implementation under #285. :)  I'm bumping this one as there are some good ideas for next version. \r\n\r\nJust so you know, in 1.4 there's a warning telling you how large the full download will be, and options to download just a few videos. \r\n1) we should definitely add\r\n2) maybe, we have now a \"Show in Finder\" that will point you to that folder so you can manage it. \r\n3) this one is not quite realistic with how Aerial work. You're supposed to pick which videos you want and either cache them or they'll get streamed and cached (unless you don't want them cached at all). Managing a rolling cache won't help with much I think.  2) was implemented in 1.4.1, 1) will be in 1.4.2 beta 2 https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta2/Aerial.saver.zip  I've got a copy of the screensaver signed using my own certificate. Is there much demand for this though? If Gatekeeper on your Mac is set to \"App Store and identified developers\" (which I believe is now the default in Sierra) then all you need to do is right-click and choose Open from the menu to get past that warning.\r\n\r\n@JohnCoates If you want I can create a new release identical to 1.2 but signed so people don't get this warning message. Version 1.4 is now signed to make it easier for everyone.   There was a bug with this a while ago, but John fixed it.\r\n\r\nAre you running the current version? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases Cool. If you're happy feel free to close this issue. :)  There's a Linux version available here... https://github.com/graysky2/xscreensaver-aerial/ Duplicate of #137   That's not really a glitch with the screensaver. The operating system handles starting the screensaver, stopping it, listening for user generated events (key presses), etc.\r\n\r\nAll I can say is to check the console log for that point in time to see if the operating system recorded anything relevant that might help diagnose the problem. I'm happy to help you trouble-shoot this but I'd need more information.\r\n\r\nIs the hang repeatable? Does your iMac stop responding every time you leave Aerial running? Sorry, there isn't much to do here then. Closing.  It's a bug in OSX/macOS.\r\n\r\nThe screensaver itself should launch and run okay.\r\n\r\nThe bug should just affect the preview in System Preferences.

Thanks for the contribution though!  @adri430 First thing, please make sure you're running the latest version. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2\r\n\r\nSecond, please make sure the screen saver isn't being blocked by a firewall or proxy.\r\n\r\nLet us know how you get on. @brandonedling Are you using the latest version? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2\r\n\r\nHave you tried caching the videos?  I hate Apple. I'm tired of explaining this bug. Last time. Never again.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple versions of the Swift libraries. Version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 and 3.0.\r\n\r\nSystem Preferences will only load one version of the Swift libraries. Once it has loaded one version it will not load another. Whichever version of the Swift libraries it loads first, that's it until you close System Preferences, the process dies and start again from scratch.\r\n\r\nSo if you open System Preferences and load a screensaver that uses version 1.0 of the Swift libraries, System Preferences loads version 1.0 of the Swift libraries. And then any screensaver that uses 1.1 or 1.2 or 2.0 or 3.0 of the Swift libraries will show that \"You cannot use the XXX screen saver with this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" error.\r\n\r\nSimilarly if you open System Preferences to a screensaver that uses version 2.0 of the Swift libraries, System Preferences loads version 2.0 of the libraries and then any screensaver that uses 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 or 3.0 will display the \"You cannot use the XXX screen saver with this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" error.\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so forth for every combination.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help please log a bug with Apple [here](https://bugreport.apple.com) or [here](http://www.apple.com/feedback/) or bug an Apple employee on Twitter or phone your Senator or send smoke signals or whatever. I reported this to them back in March through every avenue I could think of. They have done a grand total of diddly-squat to fix it.  Closing as duplicate of #11   John designed the screen saver to pick up new aerials as Apple add them. If they're not appearing for you make sure you're on the latest version.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2 Closing as duplicate of #276   First, please download the latest version. It says beta but it's been out for over a year now and includes a number of features including caching. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\r\n\r\nSecond, all versions work okay in El Capitan. The error message you are seeing is a bug in OS X (and it's still there in macOS). If you see the error message just select Aerial, close System Preferences and re-open it. The preview will then work okay. You can read more about the OS X/macOS bug here if you want. http://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html  Latest version lets you pick the cache location.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5 No problem. Happy it's working for you.  John's screensaver should pick up the new aerial movies automatically. If they don't please check you're on the latest version and make sure the screen saver isn't being blocked by a firewall or proxy.\r\n\r\nDuplicate of #276.  @jayrosen1576 Thanks, but people are getting this even with all the videos cached. Very confusing.\r\n\r\n@Lapsusone I'm randomly getting this with one Dubai video. The one titled comp_DB_D008_C010_v04_6Mbps.mov. Is that the one that sticks for you? Strangely sometimes it does play. Just looking into this just now. My theory is that it's something to do with the size of the video files. I only seem to get stuck video with the larger 450+ MB videos.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough though right now on a Mac with two screens attached I have comp_HK_H004_C008_v10_6Mbps.mov frozen on one screen and playing on the second perfectly okay. @4np Who are you asking? Me? I think this issue was fixed by a point release of macOS. Is anyone still having this problem or can this issue be closed? I'll be closing this one, please reopen if you still see it in either Mojave or our version 1.4  John designed the screen saver to automatically pick up new aerial movies. There isn't anything to do. @abodnar If I'm reading the code right each time you launch the screen saver it should check the JSON file on Apple's server. If it can't it'll fall back to a saved copy.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't seeing the new locations make sure you have the latest version. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't help try rebooting (basically to make sure there isn't a copy of the screen saver process running). Instead of rebooting you could check Activity Monitor to make sure there are no System Preferences or Screen Saver Engine processes running.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't help you might have something that is blocking access to Apple's servers. For example Little Snitch, or a corporate proxy, or something similar. Closing as duplicate of #276.  John designed the screen saver to automatically pick them up. Are they not appearing for you? @dzenbot So that hopefully people see it and stop opening new issues. :) This seems to have quietened down so closing now. Fingers crossed. :)  The videos that John's screensaver plays on your Mac are exactly the same videos from Apple's servers that play on your Apple TV.\r\n\r\nThe videos linked above aren't higher resolution. Someone just took Apple's videos and ran a sharpness filter over them. As Cristian, the guy who created them, says \"This is by no means a resolution increase and they still look blurry, but the improvements are noticeable.\"  Apple aren't involved. The screen saver won'5 be doing this either.\r\n\r\nIs your Mac perhaps short of space? macOS is designed to sacrifice things in the Cache folder first if it is running out of space.  @devlato The clock is not part of John's screen saver. It's part of macOS.\r\n\r\nI think it's always shown off centre. Apple designed it that way.  Do you have some kind of firewall/proxy software installed on your Mac (for example Little Snitch)? Or are you perhaps on a network behind a firewall/proxy? @elstgav @JacobHuschilt Can you get to http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json in a browser?\r\n\r\nYou should see a bunch of text like...\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n   {\r\n      \"id\" : \"73F3F654-9EC5-4876-8BF6-474E22029A49\",\r\n      \"assets\" : [\r\n         {\r\n            \"url\" : \"http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\",\r\n            \"accessibilityLabel\" : \"Greenland\",\r\n            \"type\" : \"video\",\r\n            \"id\" : \"D388F00A-5A32-4431-A95C-38BF7FF7268D\",\r\n            \"timeOfDay\" : \"day\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n            \"url\" : \"http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_DB_D011_D009_SIGNCMP_v15_6Mbps.mov\",\r\n            \"accessibilityLabel\" : \"Dubai\",\r\n            \"type\" : \"video\",\r\n            \"id\" : \"2F11E857-4F77-4476-8033-4A1E4610AFCC\",\r\n            \"timeOfDay\" : \"night\"\r\n         },\r\n``` I'm not sure how you can get into a situation where you have at least one of the videos (preview window populated) but you don't have the JSON source file (listbox empty).\r\n\r\nSome sort of network glitch or Apple's CDN servers not responding correctly.\r\n\r\nIt's strange.\r\n\r\nBut if it's working for both of you now, are you okay with this issue being closed?  @CRiva Which version of the screen saver are you running? I know this doesn't really help you now but the [current beta](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5) (which is now over a year old) includes the ability to cache the MOV files and as far as I can tell it's set to cache by default.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Controllers/Preferences.swift#L45  There's already a Windows version. https://github.com/cDima/Aerial/  It's a bug in macOS (it's been there for a few versions). It only affects the preview. The screensaver itself will launch and work okay. Just select Aerial, close System Preferences and reopen it. Aerial will be working in the preview okay.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the bug here if you want. http://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\r\n @tomlube You get that error when the screensaver launches full screen after however many minutes of inactivity? Or do you get just a blank screen?\n @tomlube That's strange. Do you have something installed that is cycling through multiple screensavers? Perhaps do you have something that is loading and drawing a screensaver as your desktop?\n\nThe reason for this error is that there are multiple versions of the Swift libraries, and you can get a situation where macOS (and OSX before it) loads a specific version of the Swift libraries for something and then tries to run software written in Swift with those libraries even if they aren't the correct version.\n\nSo if you're getting this error in full screen then something must have loaded a version of the Swift libraries into the process that draws the screensaver full screen.\n If you open Activity Monitor is there a ScreenSaverEngine process? If so, kill that and try again.\n @satpalsharma Select Aerial, close System Preferences, then reopen System Preferences. Let us know if you're still getting the same error. @tomlube Still having this problem? @sashcraft Did you select Aerial before closing System Preferences? You need to select Aerial first, then close System Preferences and re-open them. @sashcraft If you don't mind, with Aerial selected in System Preferences and with the error message in the preview window, could you launch Activity Monitor, select the System Preferences process, click the Info icon, select \"Open Files and Ports\", select all the files listed and send me a copy (alistairmcmillan75@gmail.com) or post it in a comment here (whichever you're most comfortable with). That should help work out why this isn't working for you.\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2016-12-28 17 20 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/125896/21527281/01aeea42-cd22-11e6-8bfc-0d019f075152.png)\r\n\r\n@tomlube If you wouldn't mind doing the same if you're still having the problem. @sashcraft @tomlube If you don't want to share the full list, I think we only really need the lines that mention \"swift\". @pquodling Did you have Aerial selected when you grabbed that list? Cause the screensaver that actually seems to be loaded is FloatingMessage.saver. Neither Aerial or the Swift libraries required by Aerial are loaded at all.\r\n\r\nIf you did have Aerial selected, I'd suggest deleting it (check `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers` just in case you have multiple copies), downloading a fresh copy.\r\n\r\n@sashcraft had an issue where the permissions were corrupted within the saver file on his Mac. A fresh copy fixed it. @jsm296 People are having this problem because there are multiple versions of the Swift libraries and System Preferences loads the Swift libraries once. It doesn't unload them and reload them for different plugins (it treats screen savers as plugins). So if you load a screen saver first that uses a version of the plugins that Swift doesn't use, then when you select Aerial it fails to run because System Preferences still has that wrong version loaded.\r\n\r\nThat's why selecting Aerial, closing and reopening System Preferences enables Aerial to run. Cause you're making sure System Preferences loads the right Swift libraries first.\r\n\r\nThe bug was reported to Apple months ago.\r\n\r\nFor now the way to fix it is simply select Aerial, close and reopen System Preferences. I hate Apple. I'm tired of explaining this bug. Last time. Never again.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple versions of the Swift libraries. Version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0 and 3.0.\r\n\r\nSystem Preferences will only load one version of the Swift libraries. Once it has loaded one version it will not load another.

The bug you reported before is unlike anything else that other users have reported. So what actually crashed this time? Was it the screen saver, System Preferences, the operating system itself?\n\n@ArthurGooding Did you have any luck getting it to work under Sierra?\n @JimmyPastel Are you behind a proxy or firewall by any chance?\n\nWhich version of the screensaver did you try?

If you're happy then please close this issue.\n  Closing as duplicate.\n  Hi @valerieosmith, if your screens aren't turning off when you use Aerial, it could be because you are running an old version of the screensaver. That was a bug that John fixed a while ago.\n\nYou can get the most recent version (that fixes some other bugs and adds some features) here:\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n  https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta3 now has a clock ;) Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  Since link is broken and we have 4K videos now, closing this.   A bit late but we have main display only in this beta : \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4.1test4/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n Closing as fixed with the release of 1.4.1  So are you behind a firewall or proxy? If you get that, it typically means that you are being blocked from accessing the videos on Apple's CDN servers.\n Cool. Glad to hear it. :)\n  LOL. You need to give us a wee bit more information than that.\n\nDo you get a \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" error message?\n\nIf so then yes it is working. There is a bug in OS X.\n\nThe screen saver itself works fine. You just get that error with the preview.\n\nSo select the Aerial screen saver, close System Preferences, re-open System Preferences and now the preview should work.

I logged a bug in their bug reporting system but it hasn't been touched yet. If you could log a bug with the feedback app and mention radar number 25569037 that might help draw attention to it. Thanks.\n  I think you might be running an old version. The developer, John, fixed this issue a few releases ago.\n\nTry the latest beta and let us know how you get on.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n @jandersonpos You really shouldn't be getting that if you have the recent version. The bug was definitely fixed in an older version.\n\nCan you check to make sure you don't have more than one copy installed? Please check `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/User/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`. It's possible to have a copy in both locations.\n @jandersonpos Cool glad to hear it's working now.\n\n@MHWbaltimore Are you still having issues with the screen saver?\n @MHWbaltimore Hi, did you get a chance to test it?\n Glad to hear it. :D\n  Are you behind a firewall or proxy perhaps? If you're being blocked from reaching the servers that host the files this is what it'll look like.\n\nTo delete the file, just close System Preferences and delete the file from the ~/Library/Screen Savers folder.\n @jeffdeville That's the way it's always worked. The URLs point to apple.com and they redirect to a CDN.\n\nSo if you try to open http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov in a web browser what happens?\n\nAnd if you try to open http://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov in a web browser what happens?\n\nWhat happens if you try going into the preferences and try caching the videos?\n @jeffdeville The JSON file gets saved as data into the screensaver's plist. Downloading the JSON file and dropping it into the cache folder won't have any effect.\n\nIf you can reach the JSON file in a web browser I'm really not sure what is happening here. You said you aren't behind a proxy. Do you perhaps have a firewall installed like Little Snitch?\n @jeffdeville Glad to hear it's working now.\n\n@songchunlin How about yourself? Are you behind a firewall or proxy?\n Two weeks. No reply from @songchunlin . Closing the issue.\n  It's a bug in OS X (and now in macOS).\n\nThe screensaver itself will work okay.\n\nTo get the preview to work in System Preferences, just select Aerial, close System Preferences, and reopen the window.\n\nFor more information:\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n @Saphiria Glad to hear it's working for you. Please report this bug to Apple using the Feedback Assistant in macOS Sierra. Mentioning the blog post above and/or rdar://25569037 might help get this fixed.\n  Closing as duplicate of comments on #233.\n  @naffan2014 At the moment Aerials only plays the movies from the Apple TV screensaver. Other people have requested the ability to play other videos and I think John was considering that, but so far no-one has written the code to make that happen.\n\nClosing and linking to #41 .\n  @ChrisBada Which version are you using? The latest beta? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n\nDid you have the videos cached?\n Tested the screen saver in 10.11.6 on two machines over night and it works fine for me. So it is compatible with 10.11.6.\n\nHow do you de-cache? Just delete the folder `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Aerial`. That's where Aerial stores the videos it downloads.\n\nSo you downloaded the latest beta, cached the videos, but you still got that black screen in the preview? And the screen saver wouldn't launch after the regular timeout?\n @ChrisBada Glad it's working now. :)\n\nYes each time the screen saver launches it checks Apple's servers for the manifest file that lists the videos. So it will include new videos in the rotation whenever they're added (caching them if you've told it to do that).\n  @dontangg Are you behind a firewall or proxy? That's the most likely cause.\n\nEasy fix though. Download the [latest version here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5). Connect to a network that doesn't block you. Cache the videos.\n\nLet us know how you get on.\n  It will run. It's just a bug in OS X System Preferences with Swift screensavers.\n\nThe screensaver will actually kick in fine.\n\nAnd if you select Aerial, then close and reopen System Preferences, the preview will work okay too.\n\nYou can read more about it here.\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n @JuanCab Cool. Feel free to close the issue if it's working for you now.\n  Please report this to Apple using the Feedback Assistant.\n\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/3092985/ios/how-to-use-feedback-assistant-to-report-bugs-in-apple-betas.html\n Over a month with no reply. Closing this issue.\n  Long story short it's a bug in OS X. The screensaver will still actually work though. If you select Aerial, then close and reopen System Preferences you won't get the error.\n\nMore here if you are curious.\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n @uxmariano There are two locations you can install the screensaver. `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`. If you are seeing two in System Preferences it likely means you have one in each location.\n\nIf the videos don't want to stream or download, are you perhaps behind a personal firewall, a corporate firewall or a proxy maybe?\n @Fitrepreneur That looks like an old version of the screen saver. You can get the latest version here. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n\nHowever if nothing is coming through at all with the old version, perhaps like uxmariano you are being blocked by a firewall or proxy?\n  Hi @uxmariano, which version are you running? The last version 1.2b5 is available here. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5 You can cache the videos on your Mac and that should eliminate any network streaming problems.\n\nGive it a try and let me know how you get on.\n  Which version of the screensaver do you have installed?\n Hi @JackOnGitHubDotCom \n\nThe newest version is available here. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n\nIt lets you cache the videos on your Mac. Which should eliminate any network issues.\n\nGive that a try and let me know how you get on. \n- A\n @JackOnGitHubDotCom Glad it's working for you now. :)\n  Not speaking for John here, it's his screensaver, but what benefit is there to compiling against Swift 2.2 or 3.0? Just curious.\n\nParticularly 3.0 since it could change again before it's finally released.\n Trust me I know all about that bug. :) http://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html It only loads the libraries for the first Swift screensaver and doesn't unload/reload for subsequent different Swift libraries. But it shouldn't cause crashes. You'll just get that `You cannot use the ... screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.` error if you try to preview another one. They all should still actually work when they try to launch outside System Preferences.\n\nAnd if you compile Aerial against 2.2 you'll only eliminate that error if all your other Swift screensavers are compiled against 2.2. What happens if people have other screensavers that are still compiled against 2.1, 2.0 or 1.0 even? They'll still bump into that error now and again.\n The code has been updated to Swift 3.  Hi @colindean if you're curious, here is why you got that message. It's a bug in OS X.\n\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n  @klauslovgreen If the display doesn't turn off you are likely using an older version. That was a bug which the developer John resolved a while ago. Please try the latest version and let us know how you get on.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n  Duplicate of #11 :)\n  John has updated the code for Swift 3.  The speed of the movies is basically whatever Apple set when they created them.\n\nIf someone was sufficiently motivated they could write and submit a patch to allow users to change the playback speed of the movies in the screensaver preferences. AVPlayer allows you to change the rate of playback. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVPlayer_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instp/AVPlayer/rate\n @fredleblanc I think if those keys work it means you're using an older version.\n\nI think they were a feature of AVPlayerView which, if I remember correctly, was preventing monitors from going to sleep. So John replaced it with AVPlayerLayer, which as a side-effect doesn't respond to the J, K and L keys.\n\nThe keys only work up to version 1.2 beta 2.\n  Which version of Aerial are you using? Are you using the latest beta? Have you tried caching the videos?\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\n @GroenteLepel @clintharris Do you have the videos cached? Is `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Cache/Aerial` populated with about 30 mov files?\n @clintharris That is really weird. Which type of Mac do you have? And you definitely only have 1.2b5 installed? Forgive me if this is a silly question but you don't perhaps have one copy in `/Library/Screen Savers` and another in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`?\n @winsmith You're using an old version. Download the latest beta from the link below, cache the videos and let us know if they still freeze after 20 seconds.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n @npoilly Are you still having issues?\n\n@GroenteLepel Which version are you using?\n @SuperGitty Have you tried caching the videos?\n @moooooooo Are you certain that folder has anything to do with this Aerial screensaver? I don't have a Mac here to confirm, but I think that's photos that are bundled with the operating system for their own screensavers.\n @moooooooo Keep checking for what? :) The screen saver is either in `/Library/Screen Savers` or `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`. That the only two locations that the OS will recognise screensavers.\n @timgonzales What model of Mac do you have? And how many screens is the screensaver running on when it freezes?\n Version 1.4 should fix all this now.   Sorry but you can't really run an OS X executable (which screensavers are) as part of a web page.\n\nThe movies though are just MOV files listed in a JSON file. It shouldn't be difficult to grab the JSON file, parse it for the MOV files and load them sequentially in a web page.\n\nHere's the link to the JSON file.\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\n  Sent a pull request to update the cask. It might get knocked back because it's a beta though. If I'm [their docs](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md) correctly it should be acceptable though.\n\n> When an App is only available as beta, development, or unstable versions, or in cases where such a version is the general standard, then said version can go into the main repo.\n\nIf not another release without the word beta might be necessary.\n\nhttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/21516\n @djui Updated cask has now been merged. :)\n\nhttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/commit/553ffe5aec54823e5531c184efcc9ca7b42b4e34\n  Do you get the same issue with beta5?\n Are you behind a proxy or firewall by any chance?\n @Dlskier If you are able to access those urls okay in a browser but Aerial is unable to access them, do you have something on your Mac that blocks individual applications like Little Snitch perhaps?\n If you've cached all the videos, then it should work whether your network is blocking access or not. The JSON file gets cached as well.\n\nI'm pretty sure the way John wrote the screensaver it tries to connect and if it fails, it loads the JSON from the stored copy in the preferences plist file.\n\nSo if you've enabled the cached option it should work if you even have no network connection at all. I'll confirm tonight that but I'm pretty sure that's the way it's supposed to work.\n @Dlskier If you're still having an issue could you try deleting the screensaver (just the actual saver file, not the cache) and downloading/installing a new copy. I've talked to a couple of people now who had corrupted installs that displayed similar weird behaviour.  Do you get an error message saying \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\"?\n Are you behind a proxy or firewall?\n\nDo either of these links work for you?\n\nThis should just load a text file... http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\n\nThis should load one of the movies...\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov\n Cool. You can close this issue if it's all working for you now.\n @meigesir So, are you behind a proxy or firewall? \n A month with no reply. Closing issue.\n  Duplicate of #40 \n  @alextd Are you certain there are new aerials? Could you describe one of the new ones, or could you grab a photo of one for us?\n @alextd @broderik @JohnCoates @Bensge @lukehamburg I've had a new AppleTV for a couple of months now and I've not noticed any new videos. Can anyone confirm there are new videos or should this Issue just be closed?\n @lukehamburg I think if new ones appear in the old feed John's code will automatically pick them up. I'm sure I noticed new ones appearing in the cache folder a while ago. Haven't noticed any recently though.\n\nCould you describe the new ones? How long ago did you notice them appear?\n @simonhowes Can you grab photos of these new videos? People keep saying there are new ones, but every time I think I see a new one on my Apple TV it turns out to be one that has already been there for a while.\n Closing as new aerials have been released and John's screensaver is picking them up as designed.  Wrote this up here. http://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n Duplicate of #4 \n  @brettrann If the screensaver pauses when you hit the spacebar then you're running an older version. Try the latest beta, it will let you cache the videos and should resolve any problems when streaming the videos. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n\n@iCHAIT Please try the latest beta and try caching the videos. That should stop the pausing you get when the videos are streaming. https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n @amrinderquikr @iCHAIT Any progress? Please check version 1.4 for this.   @leochenfc What do you mean cannot work? Do you get an error that says \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\"?\n\nIf so it's a bug in OS X. But it only affects the preview in System Preferences. The screensaver will actually work okay when it launches itself. If you see this error in System Preferences, select Aerial, close System Preferences and then reopen it. The preview will then work too.\n\nYou can read more here.\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n If it was just that error then you should really use the latest beta. The error isn't caused by a bug in the screensaver. It's a bug in OS X. And the latest beta of the screensaver offers a number of fixes and features.\n Glad to hear it's working for both of you. Closing.\n  Implemented in 1.4.2 beta2, there's now a handy button that pops at the bottom of the preferences panel when something is wrong. + all the new logging stuff in advanced.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2beta2/Aerial.saver.zip  Which release are you using? Try the latest beta release.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n Let us know if that works for you, or feel free to close the call if you're happy.\n  Are you on the latest beta? If not, give it a try and let us know how you get on.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n Glad to hear it's working for you now @roens \n\nNo reply from OP, so closing.\n  This is now fixed in 1.4 !  I have seen this bug on one of my Macs. Same thing. Normal layout for a second and then it pops into a single column. Not sure how I triggered it and it has since gone away.\n\nNothing to do with Aerial IMHO. :)\n\nI really would recommend against doing a reinstall to try to fix this. Chances are this layout error will go away all by itself.\n Closing as problem is a bug in System Preferences rather than Aerial.\n  Those dates are only being added when you put multiple copies in the Trash.\n\nEmpty the Trash. If there is still a copy in System Preferences then you've missed one. Check the folders `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`.\n Also make sure you are running the latest version, and enable the caching feature. If the videos still don't play try on another network. The videos are initially streamed from Apple's servers, so they can be blocked by proxies and network filters.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n Let us know how you get on.\n Waited months, no reply, so closing.\n  The screensaver can't wake your screen up.\n\nCheck for something disturbing your mouse/keyboard or other applications that are waking it.\n No reply for months, so closing.\n  macOS is chatty. This is a \"feature\" of the operating system. Not much an individual screensaver can do about this.  About the space bar pausing the videos, download and try the latest release. John fixed that.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n\nNot sure about the VLC thing. Tried replicating that strange behaviour on my Macs and couldn't.\n\nAnd the Aerial screensaver won't have started if one of Apple's default screensavers is running, so not sure what you're seeing when you log in and get a black screen with the clock.\n @highvoltag3 Which issue are you having? The screensaver coming up but appearing paused? Which version are you running? Have you tried caching the videos with the latest beta? The videos stream from Apple's servers by default so network issues can make it look like the videos have paused.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n No reply from OP for months, so closing.\n  Try this link in Safari or another browser on your Mac.. Does it work for you?\n\nhttp://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov\n Someone is blocking you then. Are you behind a corporate firewall perhaps? Or is your Internet being filtered by your ISP?\n Sorry. Try this... http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov\n Okay, last one. Can you open this? http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\n So you can get to the JSON file, which means apple.com isn't being blocked. But Apple use Akamai's content delivery network to host the files (the edgesuite urls) and Akamai seems to be being blocked.\n\nThe workaround I guess would be to turn on caching in the screensaver while connected to a different network, so you can download the files to your Mac. Then the screensaver will work for you at home.\n Yup, that should work, but for some reason @itsdaffa is unable to get to the videos on the content delivery network (CDN) servers used by Apple.\n @itsdaffa Did you get the screensaver working? If you're happy you can close the call. :)\n  Working for me on 10.11.3 here. Could you try again please?\n `/Library/Caches/Aerial` is the wrong location. The cache location is that folder but within your own account, for example `/Users/royedc4/Library/Caches/Aerial`.\n\nTry putting them in that folder and installing 1.2b5.\n Apple could update the JSON file to include new videos. If they do, John designed the screensaver to download the new videos.\n\nPersonally I'd leave that outgoing connection unblocked.\n Have you tried the latest release?\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n That is very weird. I've seen that message randomly before when switching between screensavers but never worked out why. If you leave Aerial selected, close System Preferences and let the screensaver start naturally after the 5 minute delay does it just show the same error full screen?\n\nIs there any chance you have two copies installed? One in `/Library/Screen Savers` and another in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`?\n That is so weird. I could understand why it might need one reboot. There does seem to be a bug in OS X where it holds on to old versions of plugins (which OS X screensavers basically are) but that should have been solved by one reboot.\n\nIs it all working for you now though? Are you happy to close this issue?\n @msheaver That can cause issues but if it was a Gatekeeper permission blocking it from running I don't think rebooting would have solved the issue that TheWojtek was having.\n\n@TheWojtek Anyway glad to hear it's working now. Closing the issue.\n  Duplicate of #137 \n Closing as duplicate of #137 \n  Starting with version 1.4, we now load 3 different JSONs, they do need their own tweaks though as they aren't in the same format, or won't use the same tags for urls. \r\n\r\nFor your specific need, with 1.4, you can edit one of the jsons in the Cache folder (see the Offline mode explaination in the readme), and add your videos there. You'll need to delete the preferences, you'll find them in \r\n\r\n~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.JohnCoates.Aerial.(something).plist\r\n\r\ndelete said file and it will reload your modified JSON. I'd suggest you use the entries.json if you need 4K and 1080p at the same time.   If you installed for all users then the actual screensaver file will be in `/Library/Screen\\ Savers`. Just delete it from there.\n\nIf you enabled the cache feature the cached videos will be in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Aerial`.\n Duplicate of #187.\n  If you have the latest version installed try going into the settings and enabling the cache setting. This will allow you to download the videos to your hard drive and play them from there.\n Glad to hear it's working. You can close this issue if you're happy.\n\nIt's not possible to add your own content at the moment, but someone has requested that John add that feature under Issue #41 .\n Closing as screensaver is now working for @hayleyselby .\n  At least partially a duplicate of #11 \n Both implemented in 1.4, check if out if you can !  In what way are they not working?\n @ElliottTrester are you still having a problem with this? Did you get it working?\n Cool. Thanks @ElliottTrester .\n  Actually that one is about splitting one video across multiple monitor, panoramic style. I4m not sure that's even possible but keeping it open in case ;)  Did this start working for you @TotalNube \n No reply for months, closing.\n  Version 1.4 should fix most of this, you can manage your cache a lot better with individual downloads and a quick access to the cache folder in the finder. We'll add something to show how large the cache currently is in a next version.  Partial duplicate of #78 \n Marked for a future update !  Closing as duplicate of #11 \n  To uninstall the screensaver you will find the screensaver itself in either `/Library/Screen Savers` or `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`. Just locate the file and delete it.\n\nIf you have cached the videos they will be in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Aerial`. You can just delete that folder.\n Updated README.  Manually merging your changes, thanks again for this @coryoso it will be in 1.4.2 beta 2  @skybleu If you installed with brew, does `brew cask uninstall aerial` not work?\n  Hi @tvwillie,\n\nHas @shaungrady answered your question?\n No answer for six months, closing issue.\n  Which version are you using?

Preliminary support for this in \r\nhttps://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4test2/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nRight now, you can set a different brightness when Aerial runs. Brightness should be restored automatically when Aerial goes away.  So yep I temporarily disabled the other options, right now there's just the start from setting that works, I'm trying to detect when the mac is supposed to get to sleep and add a \"fade\" until then but not 100% there yet, will be for next version. \r\n\r\nRegarding preview not adjusting brightness back, &\u00e0'\u00e7&)\u00e0(\u00e7')\u00e0(\u00e7 is all I have to say about those previews that don't work the same way as regular screensavers ! Thanks for the heads up I'll fix that in next version :) \r\n\r\n @dVIAN13 should have fixed the very lovely preview mode :)\r\n\r\nAdded the fade option, it will fade from one to the other in X minutes (in 10 intermediate steps), and some cool preview for the brightness. Hehe :) I thought about setting a minimum, but on my iMac 0 is not full black, you can definitely still see a bit. \r\n\r\nI think it's ok since as as soon as you lift your mouse it goes back but yeah, maybe a minimum.  I've added the night mode only and on battery only to this. It looks pretty stable (maybe not battery status detection though) Oh that's interesting. Are you using a mouse or a trackpad ? Left clicking ? This was more of a warning for me, but kinda curious on how you generated it.\r\n\r\nIt should be of no consequence though. No need, I'll remove the warning in next version.  Yeah it was more of a precaution than anything, because I have to do \"unsafe\" things to get brightness, but it's actually very stable and should be no issue. I will remove it in 1.4.4 finale :) \r\n\r\nIf something is really wrong it probably shouldn't be in (although I had some crashes in 1.4.3 \ud83d\ude05) or show in red indeed ! This was more of a beta tester message !  (removed in next build) https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.4beta3/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nThis will probably be the last beta before 1.4.4 Implemented in 1.4.4 Bah, I only removed in from the top one, not the bottom one \ud83d\ude05\r\n\r\nWill be fixed in next version thanks :)  @walda23 Did you get the screensaver running on your Macbook?\n Waited months, no reply, so closing.\n  Closing as duplicate of #144 \n  Hi @hellonearth9,\n\nDid you manage to remove the duplicate screensaver?\n Waited months, no reply, so closing.\n  Indeed thanks !  Closing as duplicate of #15 \n  @bryandmlee Are you running the [latest version of Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases)? Are you behind a corporate firewall or proxy? @bryandmlee Can you reach http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json in a web browser?\r\n\r\nIf you can reach that okay, can you reach http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov in a web browser?\r\n  As of right now, the best way to keep up to date will be using homebrew. We'll put the next finale version there really soon. Edit : homebrew is now up to date, please use this for autoupdate.  @etodac Download and install the most recent beta available [here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5). Select Aerial and click \"Screen Saver Options...\". Then select the Cache tab and click the Download button,\n\nIf your Mac can connect to Apple's servers it should be able to download and cache the videos.\n\nHowever if you are behind a proxy or firewall, it may not be able to download them.\n  Duplicate of #23. Fixed in 1.2 release.  Closing as resolved.\n  Hi @kerstin , were you able to get the screensaver working?\n If it's working for you then no need to change. :) Are you able to change the cache location now?\n\nBTW I'm not sure how it ended up with `/Applications` as the cache location. The default has always been `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Caches/Aerial`. You can see the code [here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Models/Cache/VideoCache.swift#L23).\n The way screensavers work in OS X has always been a bit weird to me. Cause they just run as plugins. A couple of times when I've updated a screensaver on one of my own Macs it seemed like it was using the UI from the new version but still running the old code. Or vice versa. Very weird. But it might explain some of the strange behaviour people randomly get sometimes.\n\nThere is a pull request to [add version numbering to the UI](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/128). :)\n\nI'll check that NSLabel in the most recent beta when I get home and annoy @JohnCoates with another pull request if it needs extended a little. :)\n  A Show in Finder button is now available in V1.4.

Do you see two copies when you go to this folder? ~/Library/Screen Savers/\nYou can use Cmd+Shift+G to navigate there in a Finder window.\n Alright cool, thanks for the info. I'm going to solve this issue by packaging releases in a DMG instead of a .zip to prevent extractors from renaming the screen saver\n  @thr0ttles You most likely have an older version of the screen saver.

Are you running the latest beta? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n Glad to hear it's working @armen52 \n\nNo reply from others, after months, so closing.\n  This is fixed in the latest beta release found here https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\n\nMore about this in issue #23 \n  So right now this no longer works with the current JSON, see comment here \r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/317\r\n This has been reimplemented for 1.4 as the new JSONs don't provide the night/day information anymore. Thanks for the contribution!  I'm working on adding a button to download all the videos, that should fix that. Please bear with me, as offline mode and caching have just been added in the last couple of days. This shouldn't take much longer.\n  Thanks @rduan8, but the official MIT License here https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT doesn't include that. Any reason why this is significant to go against the official version? \n No reply from @rduan8 for a few months. Closing.\n  Thanks, never heard of cask before. Glad to be a part of it.\n  Good feature request @cassidoo, I've never heard of this but it would be great to have this feature for that reason.\nRelated to Issue #58 and can be implemented at the same time\n Not yet @Jonathan-Rosewood! I hadn't thought about it, I'll make one asap \n https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.1beta3 bit late but this feature is in this build FYI  This seems like a simple little request. But it requires the PreferencesWindowsController to be almost all rewritten.\n\nThe implication of Cancel and OK buttons is that you hit OK and it saves your changes, and you hit Cancel and it forgets your changes. But the way the PreferencesWindowsController is written right now is that any changes are made immediately. Which makes sense.\n\nFor example: if it was rewritten to have Cancel and OK button, what should happen if someone has enabled the cache feature, downloaded all the movies and then hits the Cancel button?\n  Good to hear that fixed it. I just found the cause of that and have patched it for the next release.\n  Closing as resolved for @austonib \n  Thanks @alistairmcmillan for linking the original issue.\n  Try this beta https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta\n 1.2 beta has introduced some issues. Looking into it. Glad 1.1 is working for you right now.

Also, if you have little snitch installed try disabling it https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/\n Okay awesome! I'll add a troubleshooting section to the readme that covers this.\n  Thanks @alistairmcmillan for linking the original issue. I'm trying to fix this, but the solution I've found is quite complicated and will take a bit to implement.\n  I'm trying to track down why that error message shows up, but I haven't been able to get much info from the console logs\n Closing. OP's problem is caused by Swift bug in OS X.\r\n\r\nWorkaround is to select Aerial, close System Preferences, re-open System Preferences. Preview should then work.  Thanks!\n  This was fixed a while ago so closing ;)  @pitchmak @dayaki @abhiklodh @JacquesPienaar @samuelgustave \r\n\r\nTry downloading the latest release and caching all the videos.\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases  @peterstnsz Did you get the preference window to open correctly?\n Waited a few months, no reply, so closing.\n  Do you have Little Snitch installed or are you using a proxy at all?\n No answer after over a year, closing.  Try the latest beta https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/\n  Could you try the latest beta? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/\n @babalak Did you get the screensaver working?\n Glad to hear it. :)\n  @askming Did you get the screensaver working?\n @askming Have you tried the recent betas? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n @askming If they still don't work try the following URLs. If you're unable to view the movie at the following URLs then that most likely means a firewall or proxy is preventing you from accessing the movies on Akamai's servers.\n\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov\n\nhttp://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/b1-1.mov\n @askming Cool, that means the videos aren't being blocked. :)\n\nTry 1.2b5 and see if it works for you.\n @askming Cool. Glad to hear it. :)\n\n@devSC Did you get it working?\n @askming Not me. :) The screensaver is all @JohnCoates's work.\n  Hi @armyav8tor @kebot @aroc are you still having problems with the screensaver?\n Glad to hear it's working now @aroc.\n\nSilence from others, so closing.\n  Great feature idea! Shouldn't be too hard to add, I'll look into it.\n This is in stable 1.4.   Closing as duplicate of #10 \n  Try this caching version please https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta\n This is fixed since 1.4b9  Closing as issue is fixed for @polywebb \n  This is fixed in the latest beta https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/\n That's awesome to hear @joshlewis!\n  Thanks @alistairmcmillan for linking the original issue.

I appreciate the intent, but having users download the files themselves, create a directory, etc. is not good for usability. Ideally we want to cache on-demand as the video is being streamed.\n What your pull request is doing now is this:\n1. if movie has been cached load it from disk\n2. if movie has not been cached, start one stream to play it, start another stream to download it\n\nWhat would be ideal for 2. is:\nif movie has not been cached, start one stream to play it, use the same stream to save it to the cache\n I went ahead and added single-stream caching. I'll be adding a button to cache everything at once soon.\n  Implemented in 1.4  @UltraREX @damdeez @jaromeroes @yeluolei Did you get the screensaver working?\n Older versions only stream the videos from Apple's servers.\n\nPlease try the latest release here. You can tell it to cache the videos on your machine. This should resolve the firewall/network issues your seeing.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n @yeluolei Try enabling the caching option. Once you have a complete copy of the videos on your machine, you should be unaffected by network issues.\n  Thanks @alistairmcmillan for linking the original issue. I'm working on fixing this, but the solution I've found is quite complicated and will take a bit to implement.\n  Closing as duplicate of #13   Hi @agucova @sbugzu @nerdicly @deksden @EarMaster @JDHatman have you tried the betas with the caching feature? Do they work okay for you?\n Glad it's working for you @deksden .\n\nNo reply from others after months, so closing.\n  Thanks for creating this issue.\nLooks like this is the default with AVPlayer, and it doesn't look like there's a way to implement this normally. Found AVEnableUserIdleDisplaySleep. More research is needed.\n Thanks @alistairmcmillan for linking the original issue. I'm working on fixing this, but the solution I've found is quite complicated and will take a bit to implement.\n  @staringispolite what OS X version are you on? I'm on the latest El Capitan and it's been working for me.\n  Thanks @alistairmcmillan for linking the original issue. I'm working on fixing this, but the solution I've found is quite complicated and will take a bit to implement.\n  Hi @VictorPenkovsky @agucova have you tried one of the recent betas that allows you to cache the videos? Do they work okay for you?\n Waited months, no reply, so closing.\n  Duplicate of #4 . @RauCreativity @jamieatadobe @jbrooksuk Leave a comment on #4 if you still need help getting this to run.\n  Closing as working for @Scirocco3 \n  If you are still having this issue please try the latest release and let us know if you have any issues.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases  Hi @alienmeatsack have you tried a recent beta? Is it working for you now?\n Glad to hear it's work @alienmeatsack \n  If anyone is still struggling with this issue please try the newest release that amongst other things offering caching.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases  Closing as duplicate of #4 \n  I just uploaded a version that supports automatically caching videos https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta\n\nI'll be adding a button in preferences to cache everything at once soon\n This is implemented in 1.4  I'm working on this issue. I found an undocumented function in AVKit called AVEnableUserIdleDisplaySleep but I am not able to call it because dlsym can't get a reference to it for some reason I can't figure out. It will take some work to implement a fix, but I'm on it.\n Awesome suggestion @kolpanic, sorry I just briefly glanced over the thread and missed your initial post. I've switched over to AVPlayerLayer. Anyone having this issue, it should be fixed in the latest beta release found here https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\n  I just uploaded a version that supports automatically caching videos https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta\n\nI'll be adding a button in preferences to cache everything at once soon\n  Fixed for a while, also fixed in the preview panel now in 1.4.1 ;)  Looking into it. I have a computer on Yosemite so I'll be seeing if I can figure something out\n @mac1user @chandaraprakash Which version of the screensaver are you running? If it's not 1.2 please download 1.2 from [here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2) and try again.\r\n\r\nDo you have the videos cached? If not, please cache the videos from the Cache tab in \"Screen Saver Options...\" and try again.\r\n\r\nHow long are you leaving to start? Depending on the performance of your Mac it can take a while for the first video to start playing. Please leave for 60 seconds and see if anything happens.\r\n\r\nIf you set the screensaver to \"Start after\" a certain amount of time, does it launch itself okay? Is the issue only with the hot corner start? This is semi old but it looks like slow network, downloading the files would solve. Closing this as 1.4.1 should solve this by caching videos first.   Hi @Topener have you tried a recent beta? The way the spacebar works has been changed so this should no longer be an issue.\n No reply for months, closing.\n  Closing as duplicate of #4 \n  As mentioned in #134 @sharpguy101 would like a version for Amazon Fire TV.\n  If any of you are still having issues, make sure you are running the latest version, try caching the videos and make sure the screen saver isn't being blocked by a firewall or proxy (like Little Snitch for example).  Apple create the videos. When they release higher resolutions videos, Aerial will automatically support them.  @camdendevelopers Did you get this working?\n No reply for months, closing.\n  Closing as duplicate of #4 \n  This is in 1.4  @philipamour Did you get this working?\n Fair enough, but you don't need to disable Gatekeeper. Personally I hate when people recommend that.\n\nYou can just right-click and choose Open to allow it through.\n  Duplicate of #5 \n  This is old but this should be fixed now.  If you open up the Console app, do you see any logs that pertain to this?\n What happens when you visit the following link: http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\n I think it's because it's not able to load the JSON list for some reason. Maybe try restarting?\n You don't happen to have Xcode and are able to compile the testing target?\n Oddly enough a lot of people report the same thing. It wasn't working, and now it is.\n  Do these videos load for you? http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/watch-all-the-apple-tv-aerial-video-screensavers\n That's really odd! Can you click on the request in dev-tools and see what the header/response is?\n Closing as we have implemented an offline mode.   That is seriously weird!\n @danielsamuels @Cataklix @DomingoCP @ryck @shaungrady Did you get the screensaver to work?\n This \"cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X\" error is caused by a bug in OS X.\n\nhttp://alistairmcmillan.github.io/2016/04/25/OSX-Swift-screensaver-bug.html\n @AlexPasternak Select Aerial, close System Preferences, re-open System Preferences, the preview should now work. Let us know if it doesn't.\r\n\r\nI logged a bug with Apple about it ten months ago but they haven't responded. radr://25569037 for anyone that's interested. @fahimisediqa \r\n\r\n1) Open System Preferences and select Aerial.\r\n2) Leave Aerial selected and close System Preferences.\r\n3) Reopen System Preferences, the error should be gone.\r\n\r\nLet us know how you get on. As I mentioned on another issue. If these commands were incorporated into the screensaver, the only way for them to take effect is for the screensaver to run. And if the screensaver is running, then people don't see this error.\r\n\r\nOr to phrase it the other way around. This error means that macOS couldn't run the screensaver. If it can't run the screensaver then the commands wouldn't run.\r\n\r\nThe only way to fix this right now is by nagging Apple to get them to fix the bug in macOS. @kennyluk @MichaelDimmitt It's not a permissions issue.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple versions of Swift. Swift applications including screensavers still include their version of the Swift libraries inside their bundle because of the different versions.\r\n\r\nWhen macOS loads a Swift binary (for example when it loads a screensaver bundle into the System Preferences application) it loads the appropriate Swift libraries for the version of Swift that the binary was compiled against. If you then load another Swift binary (i.e. another screensaver) macOS does not attempt to load the appropriate Swift libraries because it already has Swift libraries loaded. Hence the error message.\r\n\r\nYou can confirm this by using Activity Monitor to look at the files loaded into the System Preferences application when you have a Swift screensaver selected. When you select a second Swift screensaver that was compiled against a different version you'll see that System Preferences doesn't unload the Swift libraries from the bundle of the first screensaver, they stay loaded and macOS tries and fails to load the second Swift screensaver and link them to those incompatible Swift libraries resulting in the \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X\".\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in macOS. It is not a permissions problem. Closing as this is solved now thankfully !  Thanks for the kind words. I don't own a Windows computer, but I'll leave this up in case anyone wants to  take on the challenge.\n I've linked to the Windows version in the readme. Thanks @cDima, great work!\n  Thanks for this. I've seen this method used in other repos, but wasn't a fan of adding a new issue. As you probably know, GitHub mirrors any images you link to in your Readme on their CDN and automatically replaces the links, so uploading content to Imgur or your personal website works just as well without the addition of any issues.\n\nRemoving 6 MB of download sounds good though, so I'll merge it.\n  Oops, this was purely for debugging and slipped past me before release. Thanks for the heads up!\n Fixed in https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/commit/230d93d2fe135b5557080255f67c613ef7a9c61b\n", "text_all_count": 56255, "text_word_token": ["Pretty", "good", "idea",

versions that are either not supported or partially supported? \r\n\r\nThis could be during installation or when they launch the options? I think this would cut down on new issues being created, especially when someone doesn't read the readme or issues list and makes a new post? just a suggestion. verbiage could point them to the standalone app to configure? @glouel thanks! I see the issues come in too and yeah, I completely agree.. I like the checkbox on a tab.. are you able to dynamically add a tab based on OS version? I don't think the tab with agreeable terms should be the default(or seen, for that matter) for users on a supported version. @glouel I like the text, but I would defer to @SeanMSmith to validate it. :) or if someone else wants to offer suggestions.\r\n\r\nAgain, great work, and SUPER fast turn around. We all appreciate the continued work to improve this project. \r\n one more thing.. which I'm sure you're aware of.. signing of the AerialConfig App. \ud83d\ude09  when I tried to open the config app, it had the right-click and open.. maybe my issue..? no worries! thanks.  Macbook Pro Retina 15in, Mid 2015 running Mojave\r\n\r\nThe 'Done' button is broken in 'Screen Saver Options' in System Preferences and I perpetually can't close the options or system preferences. Oops sorry!  #### General troubleshooting tips\r\n\r\nBefore logging an issue please check that:\r\n- [ ] You have the latest version installed (There may be a beta version that fixes your issue), see here for the latest releases and bug fixes: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\r\n- [ ] Your issue isn't already mentioned in our [issues](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues). You may find a workaround there or a similar request already made.\r\n- [ ] Your problem isn't mentioned in the [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial#troubleshooting).\r\n\r\nIf none of this fixes your issue, tell us about the problem you are experiencing or the feature you'd like to request.\r\n\r\n#### Required information\r\nIn order to help us sort your issue, we ask that you provide the following information:\r\n- [ ] Mac model:\r\n- [ ] macOS version: \r\n- [ ] Monitor setup:\r\n\r\nIf appropriate, please enable `Debug mode` and `Log to disk` in `Advanced` tab and replicate your bug, then attach the `AerialLog.txt` file (You can access this file through the Advanced tab).\r\n\r\n#### Description of issue / Feature request\r\n\r\n{{Replace this}}\r\n  1) Ability to play 4K HEVC (both streamed and cached) only when connected to power/charging. Perfect for pre-hardware-HEVC models who want 4K screensavers (Retina display is more than 1080p) when they're charging, but don't want their laptop to die from 4K decoding when running on battery power. With this setting, Aerial would cycle through all screensavers, both 4K and 1080p, when charging, but cycle only through 1080p screensavers when running on battery. (Whilst still respecting other preferences re: cached, streamed etc).\r\n\r\n2) Ability to select more than one option under \"Time\", when possible/appropriate. Obviously \"Manual\" and \"Night Shift\" are not possible together, but \"Night Shift\" and \"Dark Mode\" should be selectable at the same time. This way, I will see night screensavers once Night Shift is activated, but ALSO if I manually turn on Dark Mode for any reason, will also see night screensavers even before Night Shift times. In fact, every \"Time\" option should be selectable at the same time as \"Dark Mode\", but not with each other.\r\n\r\nThanks!  Can these videos be used for Mojave's new live desktop (day/night) feature?   I noticed that in the current source in AerialView.setupPlayerLayer, the following line appears 3 times:\r\n`textLayer.shadowColor = CGColor.black`\r\nIt probably should be clockLayer and messageLayer in 2nd and 3rd instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016)\r\nMojave 10.14.1\r\nLocal display\r\n\r\nCannot select Done from the Screen Saver Options for Aerial. This was before the 10.14.1 Mojave update. Must Force Quite System Preferences.\r\n\r\nI have the savers cached.\r\n Nah, I am an idiot. I downloaded all that Bask stuff, and tried to upgrade my older version, I guess (don\u2019t know how to show the version), and it still had only the two buttons on the Options in Screen Saver. Finally, I renamed/deleted everything, and clicked the download link for the Mac, and LIFE IS GOOD AGAIN!\n\nWonderful screen saver. Looking forward to the other options that this has.\n\nPaul W Schluter\npaul@paulschluter.com\nSent from my MacbookPro\n\nOn Oct 30, 2018, at 16:09, Guillaume Louel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n@pws442 <https://github.com/pws442> was it just after install ?

Lower case is correct, as those parenthetical remarks are part of the preceding sentence (like so). (If the parenthetical remark were a new sentence, as it is here, then the first word would be capitalized.)  I would like the option to set a custom amount of time the text stays on the screen for, not just 10 seconds or always @StrangePC This is a nice idea.

You may find a workaround there or a similar request already made.\r\n- [x] Your problem isn't mentioned in the [troubleshooting section](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial#troubleshooting).\r\n\r\nIf none of this fixes your issue, tell us about the problem you are experiencing or the feature you'd like to request.\r\n\r\n#### Required information\r\nIn order to help us sort your issue, we ask that you provide the following information:\r\n- [ ] Mac model:\r\n- [ ] macOS version: \r\n- [ ] Monitor setup:\r\n\r\nIf appropriate, please enable `Debug mode` and `Log to disk` in `Advanced` tab and replicate your bug, then attach the `AerialLog.txt` file (You can access this file through the Advanced tab).\r\n\r\n#### Description of issue / Feature request\r\n\r\nI am running the latest release (1.4.4) on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\r\nRunning 10.13.6\r\nOn the laptop screen.\r\n\r\nThe screen 'tears' into what looks like a buffer error in the code.  All the screen is now not viewable.  Touch the keyboard and it all reverts to a normal screen.\r\n\r\nI turned off the text and that made this happen immediately. When I turned it back on, it looks like perhaps it runs ok until it tries to remove the text.  \r\n\r\nDisappointing; I hope we can figure this out.\r\n @glouel When did you start signing TEST BUILDS? Okay I really like it. Its easier to use I had this exact same issue on a 2017 MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) running 10.13.6. Both \"Show with Clock\" and the quick build solved the issue. Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. Hmm...about 25% of the time with the new build I just get a black screen. Not sure if it's because of a different issue, I will revert to the previous build, test some more, and let you know. Works better, no black screens so far and I can't see the dot at all. Thanks for the hard work!  @glouel, again, Great work on this!!! \r\n\r\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2018/10/29/apple-tv-screensavers-to-mac/ Great work on all the improvements with this @glouel. Seeing the new 4K screensavers always brightens my day! \ud83d\ude04\ud83c\udf3b @glouel That is awesome so glad that you got a mention @glouel You should also add a \"Featured on 9to5Mac\" to the readme that would be a nice touch Saw this too! Mad props!!!!!!!!!  Hello. I have two external monitors connected.  One via Thunderbolt 2, and one via HDMI.  (2015-era MacBook Pro running latest Mojave).\r\n\r\nWhen I use the dimming, fade to black option, it only works on the main display.\r\n\r\nLOVE the work.  Great job!\r\n Correct. Only the physical laptop screen dims.  :-) Ah.. this makes sense.  Using the brightness button on my laptop does only change the actual laptop display.  So, if you're using that methodology, I'd understand why that doesn't work.   I think it makes sense because the Cache is more like an advanced feature, but the brightness is something people would use more @glouel Is this were you live?\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\r\nOr is it Eiffel Tower coordinates again?\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 2 20 19 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47681123-e68e0300-db85-11e8-8fe3-e94b75a9a7e7.png)\r\n ![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 2 33 01 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47681751-957f0e80-db87-11e8-834b-1e2f1df6e62b.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 2 32 45 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47681753-957f0e80-db87-11e8-91cf-2e1e7eeae863.png)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-29 at 2 32 09 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47681755-9617a500-db87-11e8-96b0-8ef0feb233bd.png)\r\nCAP. Current\r\nRemove the extra spaces between the Colons\r\n @glouel I sent JohnCoates a email like five days ago and he didn't reply yet.  Would you be able to reach out to him? Thank you now get some rest:)  An option to always have the clock be displayed but have the descriptions hide (basically separating the two in terms of when they show up) would be super cool. You can check the clock option in macOS Screensaver to get a clock all time I believe this idea has been proposed before, and the decision was made to not include it because of \u2018burn-in\u2019 potential.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, if you\u2019d like the time to remain on the screen at all times, you have to use the macOS setting to display time. Even though it does not match, I personally still find it aesthetically acceptable while enabled.   If you use your own font for the time on both Mojave and High Sierra , the seconds digits on the edge of some videos are truncated. Completely independent of the margins to corner.\r\n\r\nIt's just the wide digits like 06, 28, 39 etc.\r\n\r\nIt is on both the MacBook Pro (2016) 13\" display and the external 24\" display.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"228\" alt=\"bildschirmfoto 2018-10-27 um 16 25 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/843542/47605327-34c7c880-da05-11e8-847a-391f7aca2a48.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"207\" alt=\"bildschirmfoto 2018-10-27 um 16 18 17\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/843542/47605228-43fa4680-da04-11e8-90f8-87873f99fc80.png\">  Improvements to some video names and community descriptions.  https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master\r\n Also the contributor link https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master\r\n Okay thats fine I just wanted to tell you  ![screen shot 2018-10-26 at 10 26 09 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47582575-9145bd80-d909-11e8-922d-39663ac862af.png)\r\nAs you can see up above I can still click all the options that you don't really need access to like down below:\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-26 at 10 27 08 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47582618-b4706d00-d909-11e8-9415-41a1fa2d0e7b.png)\r\nNot selected so you shouldn't be able to type ect. @glouel See what I mean?

Apparently(if you didn't notice), when you enter your own lat/long, say from opening the 'Maps' app, the sun rise/set is different than what apple is reporting for night-shift.. any thoughts on helping make them the same values, or another option would be to not display the night shift option if it's not available or disabled..? \r\n\r\nSecondly, if the Mac supports/has enabled Night-Shift, does the OS store the coordinates used to calculate the system value for sun rise/set? if so, can the SS pre-populate those values in the text boxes when checked?\r\n\r\nI guess I don't personally see the need to have both nightshift option and manual lat/long, unless your accounting for users wanting to set their time based on an alternate location.. \r\n\r\nLastly, I also noticed the text boxes auto-round when you leave them. is that intended? Thanks for your input and clarification, it is much appreciated! I am in agreement with your thoughts. Thanks @glouel. you're work and continued pursuit to improve this app is GREATLY appreciated.  I love the ability to choose among Civil, Nautical, and Astronomical twilight (in addition to Strict and Official, which are so close to the Night Shift values as to make no practical difference unless you can see the horizon).\r\n\r\nI agree with dVIAN13 that it would be useful to pre-populate the latitude and longitude fields with the values from the user's current location (either as used to calculate the user's time zone e.g. in the Time & Date Preference Pane, or from Maps or some other method). Ah, privacy, of course! Should have thought of that.  :)\r\n\r\nPerhaps (for the future) a button in Aerial's Time pane to \"Get current coordinates\", so that any permissions dialog will appear only when the user has manually requested the current coordinates. @glouel So does it give you the correct coordinates?\r\nOr do you have to get them from maps?   I'm still on High Sierra (I have a Fusion drive that will be converted to APFS upon upgrading to Mojave, and out of an abundance of caution, I'm waiting until at least 10.14.1), so  I won't be able to test that. @glouel thanks again for this addition. This should put this issue to rest for now, as I feel this is a good compromise, without adding too much overhead/user interaction. :) Yep works fine nice addition  >If that works well, I might move that option up above night shift in the dialog, as I think it's better for most people to be able to calculate using your favorite method.\r\n\r\nI like it better to Getting my current coordinates works well in High Sierra (and the coordinates are very close to those shown in Apple Maps - they diverge at the fourth decimal place, which is close enough). Three corrections:\r\n\r\n1. Change \"Today's\" to \"Today\u2019s\" (i.e. use a proper apostrophe)\r\n2. Don't capitalize \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\"\r\n3. More importantly, when the user has chosen to calculate from Civil, Nautical, or Astronomical, then change \"Today\u2019s sunrise\" to \"Today\u2019s dawn\" and change \"Today\u2019s sunset\" to \"Today\u2019s dusk\".\r\n\r\nThe help text should probably also be changed to make clear that Civil, Nautical, and Astronomical are ways of calculating the time of dawn and of dusk, not of sunrise and sunset. Perhaps something like the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to calculate the sunset and sunrise time:\r\n\r\n- Strict (0\u00b0): Calculate when the center of the Sun crosses the horizon\r\n\r\n- Official (0.83\u00b0) : Calculate when the Sun completely crosses the horizon\r\n\r\nOr instead of sunrise and sunset, you can pick from three options for the time of dawn and dusk:\r\n\r\n- Civil (6\u00b0) : Calculate when the natural sunlight stops/starts requiring artificial light compensation\r\n\r\n- Nautical (12\u00b0) : Calculate when stars stop/start being seen\r\n\r\n- Astronomical (18\u00b0) : Calculate the point when the sun no longer interferes with astronomical observations\r\n\r\n\r\n(Note also that I have suggested swapping \"start/stop\" for \"stop/start\" in the help text above to correspond with dawn/dusk, adding \"center of\" to the definition of Strict, and correcting the spelling of \"interfere\".) > > 1. Change \"Today's\" to \"Today\u2019s\" (i.e. use a proper apostrophe)\r\n> \r\n> Is that the default apostrophe on QWERTY keyboard ?\r\n\r\nThe default apostrophe on a QWERTY keyboard is \u201c ' \u201d, what is sometimes called a \u201ctypewriter apostrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Typographic_form and the following two sections, in particular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Entering_apostrophes.\r\n\r\nOn a Mac, pressing Option-Shift-] is the easiest way to type a proper \u201ctypographic apostrophe\u201d (if your word processor doesn\u2019t automatically convert typewriter to typographic apostrophes, as many now do).\r\n\r\nMacs have had this ability to easily produce proper typographic apostrophes **since 1984**, and the fact that even today, **34 years later**, Windows users must type Alt+0146 on the number pad to enter one (if their word processor or text editor doesn\u2019t have a function to produce one) just _boggles my mind_.

My settings are such that while a user is logged in, there isn't really a point of a screensaver because for security reasons, users are auto-logged out after 10 minutes of inactivity anyway. Where I want to utilise Aerial is at the login Window where there is more likelihood of screen burn. My MDM service has options to pick which screen saver to use at the login window but when I point it to /Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver - nothing actually loads. I have read that not all screen savers necessarily work before login. That might simply be the case here?\r\n\r\nIs Aerial likely to work in this scenario or should I just pass on the idea?  @dvtch I see no reason why Aerial would not have network access and filesystem access if triggered at login (with no user logged in). \r\n\r\nI think you should investigate to move all files (prefs, cache, etc.) from user profile (`~/Library`) to main Library (`/Library`). BTW Aerial is located there\u2026 `/Library/Screen Savers/` that's why it should be able to run at login screen.\r\nThis would also avoid storing copies of cached videos in each user profile.\r\nLeaving no choice for users to choose a cache directory, just storing  cache in `/Library/Caches/com.JohnCoates.Aerial/`.\r\n\r\nPreferences would be global, no per user preferences. > Last comment [there](http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/07/set-screen-saver-login-window-mac-os-x/), people seem to say that Ken Burns won't load, which would corroborate the no filesystem thing.\r\n\r\n> Any of the image slideshow screen savers work, and a few of the Quartz Composer screen savers too\r\n\r\nBecause images and files are located in `/Library/` or `/System/Library/`\r\nmacOS images for slideshow screen savers are located here `/Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections`\r\n\r\n> but third party screensavers are not supported, \r\n\r\nthose storing prefs and/or files in user library `~/Library` can't be supported.\r\n\r\n> and neither are RSS feeds, iPhoto based slideshows, or iTunes artwork.\r\n\r\nbecause they need files located in user library or user folders. > I would add to this that installing for all users should do most of this for you already\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by _\"installing for all users\"_ ? By default macOS \"install screen savers for all users\". When you double click `Aerial.saver` file after uncompressing the downloaded archive, macOS does automatically store `Aerial.saver` in `/Library/Screen Savers/`\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"should do most of this for you already\" ? Locating prefs and caches is hard coded in developers code. Currently even if Aerial is located in `/Library/Screen Savers/` it does store it's prefs in users `~Library/Preferences/ByHost/` > Pretty sure that's no longer the default, here it defaults to current user only when installing a screensaver on Mojave. You can override at install though.\r\n\r\nOn macOS Mojave the user is asked if he want \"user only\" or \"all users\" install.\r\nIf the screen saver was already installed, macOS just update it without asking location.\r\n![screenshot 2018-10-23 at 12 56 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6991846/47356177-931e3f80-d6c3-11e8-86e6-b0c4b12ea9f3.png)\r\n > I didn't write the Preferences code so I'm not sure if it tries to use global preferences. If not it will fail but that's fixable.\r\n\r\nSolution would be to locate prefs and caches according to Aerial.saver location, user library or main library. > but if you want to explore this we definitely welcome PRs\r\n\r\nI haven't coded since GS OS and MacOS 9 ;-)\r\nI was planning to put my hands in code again, learning Swift. Will do that in a few weeks when getting my new Mac. But don't expect any brilliant coding before long :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n Further reading, I just don't think it is possible and that is through more of Apple's sandboxing than a shortcoming of Aerial. There are too many variables since pre-configured preferences are part of this deployment to ensure cache location and such are set automatically on each client. That side of it, the deployment-side, took some tweaking with munki/outset scripting but I got it deploying the settings per client quite nicely. Aerial would load during a desktop session and applied all the settings I required.\r\n\r\nIt's just that this isn't the kind of screen saver which can load at the login window, is all. I did some testing, macOS (Mojave) simply do not even try to execute any third party screensaver while at login screen. Even if locating the third party screensaver  in `/System/Library/Screen Savers` and disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP). It's probably for security reasons. Yeah, thanks for the testing @LvanProosdij - that would have been tedious.  Add an option to remove the cache of unchecked videos or add a dedicated button to remove a cached video. This to reduce disk storage for unwanted video.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for your job :)  @glouel I think that the thumbnail is a little blurry you can see below:\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-22 at 10 23 10 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47307749-ac03f380-d5e4-11e8-878a-0c7ea71e4133.png)\r\n No I have a Late 15 MacBook Air Not the Preview the thing in the bottom left corner That is so bloody cool!

Thanks! thanks!, not that it's a bug necessarily, however, if you're on the main panel(videos), and it's displaying a preview, if you then go to cache and click 'download now', it jumps back to main screen, but the display is then black. This is the case whether of not there are downloads available. I can open up a new issue if you'd like..  I got still the same problem with the error message.\r\nI use Mac OS 10.3.3 and can see in the preview the error message.\r\n\r\nI tried different versions, also the newest beta 4.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do?\r\n I saw this workaround but it doesn't work.  And i had a typo in mac version. Of course i have 10.13.3 Ok thanks. Then i will update. enabling clock doesn't work.  Been running Aerial for years on the same Mac Mini late-2012 with 2 1920x1080 monitors in a vertical stack layout. Up until today I was running fine with 1.4.1.\r\n\r\nI decided to try 1.4.2beta3 and I can't get it to play any videos.\r\n\r\nThe small mini-preview window plays video fine - I can see that when I open it via the pref pane. However, when the screensaver kicks in, all I see are 2 black screens. Triggering via the \"Preview\" button within the CP or via \"hot corner\" gives the same result.\r\n\r\nOS is Mojave 10.14.1 beta4 (18B67a)\r\n\r\nI have no problem loading or caching videos directly, nothing blocking in my firewall etc. I also tried enabling the \"Never stream videos / Never stream previews\" options, just to see if it made any difference (it didn't).\r\n\r\nReverting back to 1.4.1 got everything working again.\r\n\r\nI enabled Debug Logging and here's the output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n5:07:54 PM : UI logToDisk: true\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7faae1c161a0> stopAnimation\r\n5:08:02 PM : avInit1\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> AerialView setup init\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> isPreview : false\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> singlePlayerAlreadySetup false\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> nbPlayers 0 previewPlayerExists false\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> no local player\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> setupPlayerLayer\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> setting up player layer with frame: (0.0, 0.0, 1920.0, 1080.0) / (0.0, 0.0, 1920.0, 1080.0)\r\n5:08:02 PM : Manifest init\r\n5:08:02 PM : isManifestCached 10 true\r\n5:08:02 PM : isManifestCached 11 true\r\n5:08:02 PM : isManifestCached 12 true\r\n5:08:02 PM : Manifests files were not loaded in class\r\n5:08:02 PM : Files were not already loaded\r\n5:08:02 PM : Manifests are cached on disk, loading\r\n5:08:02 PM : Poi Strings Provider initialized\r\n5:08:02 PM : path : /Users/luke/Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver/Contents/Resources/en.json\r\n5:08:02 PM : Community JSON : 54\r\n5:08:02 PM : Could not determine duration, video is not cached in any format\r\n5:08:02 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> Setting player for all player layers in []\r\n5:08:02 PM : Time Management initialized\r\n5:08:02 PM : initvideocache\r\n5:08:03 PM : cached video file with length: 287804109\r\n5:08:03 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> playing video (OFFLINE MODE) : file:///Users/luke/Library/Caches/Aerial/b2-2.mov\r\n5:08:03 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> observing current item <AVPlayerItem: 0x600001852a30, asset = <AVURLAsset: 0x600001a1ed00, URL = file:///Users/luke/Library/Caches/Aerial/b2-2.mov>>\r\n5:08:03 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> observeValue Optional(\"readyForDisplay\")\r\n5:08:03 PM : AssetLoaderDelegate deinit\r\n5:08:03 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8069200110> backing change 1.0 isDisabled: false\r\n5:08:03 PM : avInit1\r\n5:08:03 PM : <AerialView: 0x7f8066e0a1e0> AerialView setup init\r\n5:08:18 PM : <AerialView: 0x7faae1c161a0> startAnimation\r\n```\r\n No, I was not using mirroring mode\u2014Unique video on each display. @glouel Thanks for such a quick fix! Yes, I confirm that [1.4.2beta4](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases) works just fine.  I have late 2015 27\" iMac with Mohave OS and latest version of Aerial. Although Mac supports Nightshift this option is greyed out in the Time tab under preferences. New to Aerial not sure if a problem or my lack of knowledge!\r\n No error message but I had a similar problem to user in post #528 ie (null) in Night Shift / Sunrise section of Terminal output. Turning Location Services off and on seems to have fixed it. Thanks for the help. Ah. I did not notice the times are there until you pointed them out. I don't think they were there before and the complete option was not available.  I noticed that since the seconds of the digital clock are constantly changing, the \"AM\"/\"PM\" are always shifting left and right to compensate for the added/lost pixels needed for the different numbers that make up the seconds.\r\n\r\nTo address this distracting shifting of the \"AM\"/\"PM\" indicator, either:\r\n\r\n(1) make the \"AM\"/\"PM\" fixed, disconnecting it from the seconds that precede it, and/or;\r\n(2) give the option to disable the seconds on the clock\r\n\r\nps: I am using the font San Fransisco Pro Text. Great, thank you @glouel !  Fixed this @glouel It is ready to merge  CAP. Is there any way you could give me direct edit access to the readme.md only?\r\nIt may save you some time so that I don't have to create a pull request every time.  ## Known Issues\r\n\r\nBefore logging an issue please check if one of the problems you are experiencing is mentioned here. If the issue you are experiencing isn't covered here, then please delete this content and tell us about the problem you are experiencing or the feature you'd like to request.\r\n\r\n### \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X.\" message\r\n\r\nIf you get a message saying `You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.` that is a known bug with macOS that was reported to Apple in April 2016 as [rdar://25569037](http://openradar.appspot.com/25569037). As of November 2017 the bug is still not fixed. To work around the bug:\r\n* Select the Aerial screensaver in System Preferences\r\n* Close System Preferences with Aerial selected\r\n* Reopen System Preferences and the preview should work now\r\n\r\n### Mac won't sleep with Aerial as screensaver\r\n\r\nIf your Mac won't sleep while Aerial is the selected screensaver, then you probably have an older version of Aerial installed. Download the latest verson of Aerial here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/ Make sure to check both locations for the old version, it can be installed to `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/User/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`.\r\n\r\n### Corrupted playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting corrupted playback when the screensaver starts then that is a new bug in macOS High Sierra. It appears to be a problem with the Intel drivers in High Sierra. As a workaround tick the \"Show with clock\" option as that seems to eliminate the corruption for the moment. Discussed extensively here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/377\r\n\r\n### No playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting a crossed out play icon instead of the preview or the videos just never seem to load, please check that a firewall or proxy isn't blocking the screensavers access to the videos. Trying the following two URLs in a web browser might show if they are blocked. If you are on a Macbook you can also try caching the videos on another network to test whether it is your network provider that is blocking access.\r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\nhttp://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\n Also tried reinstall and restart options, no go!\r\nWell, maybe takes another 2 years to get a working mac scrennsaver?! Also suprising, how complicated a screensaver can be?!\r\nMuch easier on Windows!! Sorry but tried over 30 minutes and just wanted to install a screensaver not a new operating system.\r\n\r\nThanks for your quick response.\r\n\r\nI closed/reopened System Preferences many times with Aerial selected/unselected but Click on Preview was Black Screen. The mini preview screen was shown though.\r\nWhen I click a video on the list it starts playing.\r\n\r\nI finally found out that the screensaver itself seems to work, only the preview is (still) not working ( black screen)?!\r\n\r\nMaybe a Message when click on Preview: \"Even if you see a black screen the screen saver still may work\"?!\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Hi,\n\nthanks for distributing this fast fix. The screen saver itself looks very cool.\n\nAnyhow I encountered two other issues now:\n\n1. In 1.4.1 I could say only show on main monitor, now it automatically shows on all monitors (vertical and horizontal) but not in the wright way (see picture)\n2. Before I saw caption on the pictures, now there are none and also no options for labels.\n\nAlso there are a lot less options now (see other picture)?!\n\nBest regards\n\nMichael (Mebo)\n\n\n\n\n\n> Am 20.10.2018 um 22:52 schrieb Guillaume Louel <notifications@github.com>:\n> \n\n> Closing as fixed in 1.4.2 beta 1 https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.2beta1 <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.4.2beta1>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/559#issuecomment-431617164>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/APAtndlUG7OEpE21i-yW5MgX6sQY0E46ks5um40ngaJpZM4XyB34>.\n> \n\n Here the pictures...and yes I restarted preferences at least 5 times, also I deleted the old version before installing new version.\r\n\r\n\r\n I took Aerial.saver out of the following archive:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15740317/47260878-00fc1880-d4c4-11e8-8369-7076e76d9e8f.png)\r\n Ok, tried the other zip file now, that seems to be the newer version.\r\n\r\nBut the picture still shows in the same layout on vertical screen.

And this option, probably, should be on both pages.  It would be nice to have a setting to make the clock sticky while the location information is fading in and out. to build on that, an option to have it on it's own fade-in/out schedule around the screen... however, I still just use the sys-pref show with clock option to accomplish that... I don't mind the design of it's overlay(personally).. By the way, I should have thought that \"horizontally opposed\" meant \"across, on the other side of the screen, on the same level horizontally\" not \"above or below\".  I think we don't talk about the same improvement: what I would like (if possible) is - when you look at my screenshot - that the clock stays visible at all time in the same position and only the description below fades in and out just as it can be done right now.\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"bildschirmfoto 2018-10-20 um 13 13 35\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6912918/47255018-5dcae500-d46a-11e8-94f6-6b85b9947039.png\"> Ah yes, that makes sense. I have to ask though: Font size and Screen size are constant for each session at least and only text length is variable, correct? So normally the clock doesn't have to be dependent on text length of the info text except when it exceeds one line. So will the clock also be moving by a few pixels if the info text always stays on one line (because the display is wide enough)? And would it make sense to look at other possibilities like:\r\n* making the info text denser, if it would exceed one line\r\n* clipping the info text, if it would exceed one line\r\n* always reserving space for two lines of info text (okay, this may cause problems on really small displays or large font settings)\r\n\r\nThose are just some thoughts and I would be most happy if the clock doesn't move as long as the info text stays on one line, but every solution would be an improvement in my opinion. Makes sense, thanks for the clarification. Wow, that was fast. With IBM Plex Sans it also doesn't move. This is exactly what I thought of when opening the issue. Should I test some other scenarios for you? Everything you wrote in the last post works as intended. I have just one thing you might want to consider: When using the option \"Show location: 10 seconds\" and a fixed corner, then the clock stays all the time and doesn't disappear with the info text which some people might want (and others might want exactly this behavior). I will personally use \"Show location: always\" with the fixed corner and that's perfectly solved now ;)  Is there a way where @glouel could make a test build with this feature because I'm not sure how it would look. Ok, maybe not this build maybe 1.4.3, once you have all the descriptions:) @glouel Is learning his spelling and Grammar!!!!!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\r\nYou get a 5/5! Oh and also turn 1.4.2test9 into beta 1.\r\nYou don't need to change anything though. And don't forget to sign it I didn't mean to close this sorry:\\ @glouel Do you think you could get this feature to work?\r\nMaybe by making a different `.json` for each speed Videos are slow motion, it can be cool to see them accelerated to normal motion or fun at faster speed.\r\nBut low priority indeed. +1  Brew should be followed by Cask, and fixed recommondation with recommendation @glouel I think Terminal is a proper noun because it is an application by Apple I will create another pull request with Terminal CAP.\r\nYou can tell me what you think:)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-19 at 1 16 44 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47241628-4116aa80-d3a1-11e8-95d3-9997e84408b2.png)\r\n  \r\n![screen shot 2018-10-18 at 2 19 06 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47185011-1f55ee80-d2e1-11e8-9193-78d7dbebbd73.png)\r\n@glouel This is another bug I found that should be easy to fix:)\r\n Thank you!

Are there any plans?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nChristian If you installed Brew Cask, is there a way to run the 'brew cask reinstall aerial' command from Automator? I can't seem to get it to work. @alxndrsbrwn I have created a Automator file, I don't use Brew Cask, so I don't know if this works. Thanks\r\nIt is currently Broken\r\n\r\nIf you know how to add a \"run this action every 2 days\" to it and comment it for me that would be great.\r\nThat would make it a full auto update.\r\nEverybody else just simple add the file up above to you desktop and double click it.  BAM!!!! Aerial is updated.\r\n @glouel Read this up above.\r\nAnd mark fix inside while we wait for the full auto update.  Then you can add it to readme.md so there wouldn't so many duplicates of the same issue @glouel I created a Aerial Updater that you can link with the readme.\r\nhttps://github.com/NightRaider73/Aerial-Updater/invitations @glouel Time to close  In Aerial 1.4.1 running under macOS 10.13.6, when I click the Preview button in the Screen Saver pane of System Preferences, the screen goes dark, but no video plays.\r\n\r\nThe video does play in the thumbnail of the Screen Saver pane, and also when activating the screen saver (e.g. by using a hot corner), just not when clicking the Preview button.\r\n\r\nPreviews of other screen savers play as expected when I click the Preview button, just not of Aerial.\r\n\r\nThis problem did not appear with Aerial 1.4 and is new to Aerial 1.4.1. No, I'm using just the built-in display on my iMac, and Aerial is set to play Aerials \"Only on Main Display\". I confirm that Aerial 1.4.2 test 6 (I've not tested test 4 or 5) corrects this problem for me.\r\n\r\nThank you! In 1.4.2 test 7, I'm now noticing that the full-screen preview plays the **_first_** time I click the Preview button, but not the second or subsequent times. (I don't know if this is a change in behavior from test 6, or if I just didn't test test 6 adequately.)  I'm going to submit the following corrections and suggested improvements to video names and descriptions in batches, since compiling these takes quite a lot of time.\r\n\r\nFirst up: **_San Francisco

That way, depending on the sys pref settings for sidebar text (which are still too long for me at small), I would think that a hovering tool-tip could help complete the rest of the name. @glouel I can go through later and correct all of your spelling if you want me to :) haha... it's better than nothing! works for me.. I like your other tooltips, but I sure that's more work! > If you see stuff either in the UI or in the readme, sure ! I think the UI should be mostly fine (maybe not the newer stuff like Text panel, etc).\r\n\r\nI don't code so where would I find the UI files?

take a whack at these. :-) Yes, the alternate descriptions checkbox sounds reasonable. \"Alternate English Descriptions\" and \"Enhanced English Descriptions\" both suggest themselves to me.\r\n\r\nMy suggested descriptions above assumed keeping many of Apple's existing descriptions (anywhere I didn't explicitly suggest changing or removing them, in fact). To avoid copyright issues, I'll go through those descriptions and rewrite them.\r\n\r\nI'll _try_ to get to that later today (Friday here in California), after I get some sleep. I'm going out of town on Saturday and will be out of touch until Thursday, if not later. @glouel Looking good with the additions:) Looking at the new **names** I proposed (not descriptions) in 1.4.1test7, I'm noticing that several are too long.  I would suggest:\r\n\r\n**_Los Angeles_**\r\n\r\nChange \"Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110)\" to \"Harbor Freeway\"\r\nChange \"Los Angeles International Airport\" to \"Los Angeles Int\u2019l Airport\"\r\n\r\n**_San Francisco_**\r\n\r\nChange \"Marin Headlands to Golden Gate\" to \"Marin to Golden Gate\"\r\nChange \"The Embarcadero and Market Street\" to \"Embarcadero, Market Street\" (both day & night)\r\n Okay, I think that I've now rewritten all of Apple's original descriptions for those videos for which I've suggested improvements above, so that none of their copyrighted text is mixed in with my suggested descriptions.\r\n\r\nI've also taken the opportunity to make a few small improvements to my descriptions here and there.\r\n\r\nI've edited the posts above to reflect all my changes. (I hope that doesn't complicate things for you, but GitHub can show the edit history, yes?)\r\n\r\nI'm off to San Francisco tomorrow (in about 12 hours, actually), after which I'll be out of touch most likely until Thursday.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, thank you for all your fine work on Aerial! Regarding the two Golden Gate Bridge videos with the whacked-out descriptions:\r\n\r\nA013_C005 should instead go with b4-3.mov, and the name should be \"Presidio to Golden Gate\"; Apple's two descriptions there are good.\r\n\r\nThe video b10-3.mov (which I call \"Marin to Golden Gate\") does not seem to have any corresponding descriptions at all in the POIs you sent me, so we should just use mine above.\r\n\r\n(The group of descriptions labelled \"San Francisco Golden Gate from SF\" in the POIs doesn't seem to correspond to any video we have.)\r\n Sorry, I edited the descriptions for b4-3.mov last night, but evidently did not click the Update button! Here is what it should be (now actually updated in my first post above as well):\r\n\r\n**Movie:** b4-3.mov\r\n**Name:** Change \"Golden Gate from SF\" to \"Presidio to Golden Gate\"\r\n**Descriptions:** Replace all descriptions with Apple's two descriptions for A013_C005:\r\n_Start:_ \"Moving along the Presidio of San\u00a0Francisco toward the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge\"\r\n_190s:_ \"Crossing the Golden\u00a0Gate Bridge toward the Marin\u00a0Headlands\"\r\n I'm off to SF now and will have to wait until I get back to check out the new Aerial--by which time, at the rate you're going, there'll be so many improvements I'll barely recognize it!  :D Why doesn't Apple have any views of France? they should the Eiffel Tower would be cool I would much rather look at a flyby of the Eiffel Tower, or just about anything else, than a close-up flyover of a Los Angeles freeway! (I assume the Harbor Freeway video is Apple's way of mocking Los Angeles.)\r\n\r\nGuillaume, I would still suggest changing the name \"Harbor Freeway (Interstate 110)\" to \"Harbor Freeway\". The former is too long, \"Harbor Freeway\" is more descriptive than only \"Interstate 110\", and viewers will learn that it's also called \"Interstate 110\" from either Apple's descriptions or our community descriptions.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest changing the name \"Marin to Golden Gate\" to \"Marin Headlands in Fog\", which would be more descriptive and would contrast nicely with the \"Marin Headlands\" video, which follows a similar route. Would it be possible to italicize the names of the ships in the community descriptions for Fisherman's Wharf and the three River Thames videos? That is the usual style in English.\r\n\r\nSo HMS _Belfast_, SS _Jeremiah O\u2019Brien_, and USS _Pampanito_. (Note that the \"HMS\", \"SS\", and \"USS\" are _not_ italicized.) Looks straightforward enough, but how do I actually edit the file? Do I need to fork it first? With \"Use community information when available\" unchecked, the two San Francisco videos with confused descriptions are still confused.\r\n\r\n\"Presidio to Golden Gate\" is still using the wrong set of Apple descriptions, and \"Marin to Golden Gate\" (or \"Marin Headlands in Fog\") is still using northbound descriptions for a southbound video.\r\n\r\n(When using community information, both videos now have correct descriptions.)\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/547#issuecomment-431557719. Thanks for the tip; this should should be much more efficient!  Could you change the name of the space video \"Southern California to Baja\" to \"Northern California to Baja\" (or let me know its ID so I can add it to the Community JSON)?\r\n\r\nThis video actually starts north of the California border (out to sea, west of the Oregon coast), and its current name is just plain wrong. (You'd think the folks at Apple would know better.)  In v1.4.1, under the Text section of the Screen Saver Options, \"Extra information:\", 'diagonally' is spelt with an extra 'n'.\r\n<img width=\"263\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-10-17 at 13 22 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15274194/47063876-b5214900-d20f-11e8-959e-8adfe31ae743.png\">\r\n\r\n  Starting with the betas of 1.4, the description on the space videos just says \"Space\". I have removed the screensaver, and the cache, the reinstalled, but still have the issue. I also have the issue on another Mac. The list is okay, it is the deception when viewing the screensaver.\r\n\r\nMacOS 10.14\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-10-16 at 19 56 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16837687/47040214-a38f6100-d17d-11e8-99e3-cfdc4d162c06.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"lwscreenshot 2018-10-16 at 19 58 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16837687/47040357-f832dc00-d17d-11e8-9d07-4ee500e61f18.png\"> No, it\u2019s not checked. I have tried it with it checked, and I have the same issue. The line underneath says preferred language: English (United Kingdom).\r\n\r\nOn the other videos I\u2019m only getting the city names, not the detailed descriptions that are visible in the sidebar.\r\n\r\nSomething to note; in the cached folder, there are only videos. There used to be JSON files and the like, with metadata about the videos. Have you moved these? I did not move the cache folder. The issue must have arisen when I cleared the cache and removed the screensaver via the finder, but not the plist, before installing the first release you made.\r\n\r\nI have done why you have suggested, and it has fixed it! Thanks!\r\n\r\nI guess most people will not have this issue. I only cleared out the cache manually to remove excess videos from before, because it did not work through the screensaver preferences. Also the flaw in removing screensavers on a Mac, I does not remove the associated files.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome! The error pane will be useful!\r\n\r\nDo you have to remove the old version before installing a new version?\r\n\r\nI understand when you are updating to a new versions, maintaining the plist is useful to ensure the settings stay them, but for people who want to fully remove it, an uninstall option may be nice.\r\n\r\nOn a related note; is it possible to have an update feature from the preferences pane? > Do you have to remove the old version before installing a new version?\r\n\r\nGood to know!\r\n\r\n> I understand when you are updating to a new versions, maintaining the plist is useful to ensure the settings stay them, but for people who want to fully remove it, an uninstall option may be nice.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense. Maybe some instructions would suffice?\r\n\r\n> On a related note; is it possible to have an update feature from the preferences pane?\r\n\r\nA notification that there is a new version would be good. VirtualBox for example directs users to a website to download the latest version, which I find bizarre for a company as large as Oracle can not have a proper updater for a standalone app! Adobe does the same with the Flash updater in the System Preferences pane, but that is pretty much dead.\r\n\r\nThat lag would not be noticeable for most users to be fair.\r\n\r\nI use coderelease.io to tell me about your releases.\r\n Still not working for me.  The files are not there for me. Where else could they be? I already tried both places. Weird. Any other ideas? Put both in?  Or just one?\r\n I did it and it still isn't working it this right:\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-16 at 2 55 17 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44180668/47049945-8e054180-d153-11e8-95b3-8cab767429d6.png) Thank you so much it is working for me now!\r\nMaybe put that guide in to the [readme.md](\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Readme.md) under troubleshooting.  I love to use Aerial and I'm very pleased to know that Aerial contains every Aerial video, including thee old San Francisco videos. Yet after downloading, I can't find them. And I really want to know why and how to solve it. @glouel Close fixed in 1.4.1  I love the support for quicker video fades in 1.4.1 beta 3, but I find that the quicker description fades that go with them are too demanding of my attention. When the description appears suddenly, my eyes are drawn to it against my will, even when I know it's coming and don't want to look at it.\r\n\r\nWhen instead the description fades in gradually, I'm not distracted from focusing on the detail of the video, but I know the description is there, waiting discreetly to be read I want it.\r\n\r\nI found the description fades in 1.4 to be ideal. I would love to able to keep that duration for description fades while selecting, say, 0.5s for the video fades. Seems worth a try, if you don't think we're in danger of becoming too un-Mac-like by overloading the UI with choices. ;-) I love now being able to have two-second description fades with half-second video fades: the perfect combination for my taste. Thank you!  not sure if this is a 'feature' ;) but on the settings panel, you can 2-finger scroll over the video preview, and it will go forward/reverse! easter-egg/feature/bug? \ud83d\udc4d you can close this one out!  nice! great work, thanks!  using 1.4b2, when I click 'preview' or let the screen saver kick in, I get a black screen(with descriptions & time though). tried uninstall/re-install and still persists. haha.. no problem. just figured it out as you replied. good catch! @glouel also, when the 'mirror' option is chosen, the descriptions/time is only shown on the main monitor.. maybe an option for which monitors to display on? thanks! confirmed working!  Using the newest beta (1.4.1 beta 1) the screensaver still crashes for me if I try to mirror the videos to both of my monitors.  It works fine if I let it play different videos to each monitor.\r\n\r\nI'm using 4k exclusively and have pre-cached all videos.\r\n\r\nI'm running OSX 10.14 (Mojave) and my two external monitors are Dell U3818DW (37.5\" 3840x1600) monitors.  This is on a Mac Pro with the AMD FirePro D500 graphics cards.\r\n Here's what I get from the (?):\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-15 at 12 23 27 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/870705/46970059-31cbf000-d075-11e8-94f2-98ae8bfbc742.png)\r\n\r\nLet me try the new version... Ok - the new one works with mirroring (although I got a weird crash of the System Prefs pane the first time I clicked on it - then it worked after that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f ). While I've got you here... have you seen any way to set a screensaver a background in Mojave?  They seem to have removed the old way of doing that (probably because they added the new dynamic screensaver stuff).\r\n\r\nI loved having Aerial as my desktop background! Also: thanks for continuing to work on this project!  I really appreciate it! The panel crashed - sorry I didn't capture the message something about \"Went wrong\".  I think that what happened is what you described - that the old version of the screensaver was still running.\r\n\r\nYeah - I used to run Aerial as my background - but that command that's in #13 doesn't exist in OSX Mojave... just a bummer   No problem!

Installed 1.4b without any problem.\r\n\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) running 10.14 @glouel Thanks for the prompt response. \r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce my issue:\r\n1. Install it by double clicking file \"Aerial.saver\"\r\n2. Click install when I see this <img width=\"494\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-13 at 11 20 20 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/561360/46912272-ea434800-cf3e-11e8-9555-bf49e13003b9.png\">\r\n3. Scroll down the list of available screensavers and click on \"Aerial\" \r\n4. Error message appears and brings me back to the system preferences main screen\r\n\r\nI also tried your suggestion by installing 1.4 on top of 1.4b9, and I get the same error. I get the exact same error after a fresh install, with the same steps as @ckhk212 in 10.14. I downloaded the latest release, 1.4. @glouel. Please see below for my comments to your questions. Thanks.\r\n\r\n- was this a fresh install or on top of 1.2 the first time ?\r\n\r\n    Ya, fresh from scratch 10.14\r\n- I assume you installed manually, not through brew ?\r\n\r\n    Yup, just manually download release 1.4, unzip and double click the saver file\r\n- are you behind a proxy/firewall\r\n\r\n    Not that I am aware of\r\n- which region did you set in MacOS settings\r\n\r\n    Canada\r\n- would you be willing to go into your user library and try deleting ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.JohnCoates.Aerial.(UUID).plist\r\n\r\n    Tried it, same problem. (deleted plist and removed the Aerial from system preferences and install again)\r\n- long shot but could you possibly launch console.app, filter by \"Aerial\" top right, then try loading the screensaver again (go back to Destop & Screensaver to generate the error) and let me know of any lines you see in console ? If it doesn't show anything, you may want to try again without the filter and see if there's crash message from System Preferences\r\n\r\n    Here you go \"Aerial: Error can't load tvos11.json from cached directory\"\r\n- Do you know of anything special about your MacOS environment maybe (installed some specific dev tool, another bash, etc or something) ?\r\n\r\n   No, quite a fresh install.\r\n- Does ~/Library/Caches/Aerial exist ?\r\n\r\n    Yup, with these files: `TVIdleScreenStrings.bundle`, `tvos10.json`, `entries.json`, `tvos11.json`, `resources.tar` and not seeing any `.mov` files No problem @glouel. The `tvos11.json` file is not empty and it is exactly 7kb. The content looks the same as https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/entries.json. Also, tried deleing it and it downloads back properly, but same error. BINGO! @glouel It works right away.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the console messages I see:\r\n<img width=\"1245\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-14 at 12 48 20 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/561360/46919590-71300900-cfaf-11e8-98e6-7dedede0926a.png\"> Initially I don't see any `AerialML` in the log until I waited the screensaver to kick in, then I see this\r\n```\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.661131 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: Manifest init\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.661637 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: tvos10.json manifest is cached\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.661775 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: 10 true\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.662071 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: tvos11.json manifest is cached\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.662295 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: 11 true\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.662520 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: entries.json manifest is cached\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.662652 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: 12 true\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.662980 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: manifests are NOT saved in preferences\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.663123 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: Not available from plist\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.663294 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: tvos10.json manifest is cached\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.663518 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: tvos11.json manifest is cached\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.663686 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: entries.json manifest is cached\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.663831 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: Manifests are cached on disk, loading\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.664259 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: 12path : \r\ndefault\t13:02:32.665079 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: 11path : \r\ndefault\t13:02:32.665488 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: 10path : \r\ndefault\t13:02:32.666165 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: LSM\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.666331 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: lsm12\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.680808 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: lsm10\r\ndefault\t13:02:32.699955 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: post json loading\r\n```\r\nI don't see how many videos were processed though. > No \"XX videos processed !\" at the end (after the \"post json loading\") ?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nWhen screensaver starts again, this is what the log shows\r\n```\r\ndefault\t13:15:39.239287 -0400\tcom.apple.preference.desktopscreeneffect.remoteservice\tAerialML: post json loading\r\ndefault\t13:15:51.532988 -0400\tScreenSaverEngine\tAerialML: Manifest init\r\n```\r\n >Just to be clear, you see the UI when you click Screen Saver options right and it roughly works ?\r\nWith a non empty list ? :\r\n\r\nYup, it works and I query string \"videos processed !\" and I see `65 videos processed !` No worry @glouel Thanks for the good work.\r\n\r\nIf you don't need more info, I will downgrade back to 1.4b9 and look forward seeing your next release.

Do you think it might be a good idea to give the user the choice of font and size, or at least of size only? (Other users with poorer eyesight might wish for even more prominent descriptions.)\r\n\r\nMind you, I would be quite content to live with Aerial in its present excellent state, and if you feel it desirable to maintain consistency with the appearance of the tvOS screen saver (which I have never seen), or if this would add needless complication, then please feel free to disregard this suggestion. :-)\r\n\r\nP.S. By the way, I think the 10-second display time for the descriptions is just right. By the way, getting off topic, I do hope you'll number the next release 1.4.1 and not 1.41, otherwise I and others will wonder whatever happened to 1.5 through 1.40, and if you then release 1.5 _after_ 1.41, you'll have mobs of release engineers armed with torches and pitchforks to deal with.  ;-) I know San Francisco and Los Angeles, and London is easy enough (as most if not all of the London videos follow the same route along the Thames, as I recall). I'll see if I can come up with some better location names next week. I think i would second the proposal of having the titles move around, if you select \"always\". It could be that after 10 seconds, the title fades out and is moved randomly to one of the 3 other corners.\r\n\r\nThat way, it would prevent burnin, which is why we have screensavers in the first place... ;)  I was thinking more of a continuous jump, during playback for each video. As i said, the video itself is in motion, but it would be better if the title moved around during playback, say, every 10 seconds.\n\nNot exactly the same as a random corner, for each new video.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t speak French, would you? ;)\n\n> On Oct 15, 2018, at 11:31, Guillaume Louel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> @ludwig1224 <https://github.com/ludwig1224> Right now there's a tiny bit of that in 1.4.1beta1, if you pick the random corner option in the descriptions pane, the description will move around each time the text changes.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/535#issuecomment-429901647>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AKZ8r_PaGbi1wRU_zZ34nmrFVVS8FZIYks5ulKpMgaJpZM4XabJg>.\n> \n\n\n---\nLouis Chr\u00e9tien\nlouis.chretien@gmail.com\n\n  I'm getting into the realm of picking very small nits here, but I begrudge every moment of stunning 4K detail of our planet lost during the relatively slow fade-outs. Would it be possible to speed up the fade-outs, so that they match the speed of the fade-ins, and perhaps to add a preference to disable fades altogether? I'm seeing two-second fade-outs (which are too slow for my taste) and what appear to be much quicker fade-ins (which I don't mind). I would think the menu with those four options would satisfy just about everyone. I'm guessing I'd be happy with 1s or 0.5s.\r\n\r\n(This all gives one an appreciation for the amount of trouble that Apple takes to narrow down choices in their UI, in contrast to the Windows and Linux world, where software developers are quite happy to drown their users in all the choices they could possibly want.)  :-) Fades are _much_ faster in 1.4.1test2; in fact, I seriously doubt if the total time from the beginning of the fade-out to the completion of the fade-in is as much as 0.5s now.\r\n\r\nI don't mind the much faster fades and prefer them to those in 1.4, but some might find them abrupt. You've been busy!\r\n\r\nThis is interesting. In 1.4.1 beta 3, I am now seeing 0.5 second fades when set to 0.5 seconds, 1 second fades when set to 1 second, and 2 second fades when set to 2 seconds. (I never tested 1.4.1 beta 1 or 2, or test 4.)\r\n\r\nIn 1.4.1 test 2, as I reported previously, fades were _much_ faster than 0.5 seconds, and the same was also true with 1.4.1 test 3. (In fact, I could discern no difference between test 2 and test 3.)\r\n\r\n(In every case, I was careful to close and re-open System Preferences after installing the new version of Aerial.)\r\n\r\nIn other words, something has changed besides the user interface.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, all seems to work correctly now, and I'm quite happy with the 0.5 second video fades.\r\n\r\nThank you! You said you had changed to cubic ease in 1.4.1 test 3, and I saw no difference there from 1.4.1 test 2. Fades were nearly instantaneous in those two builds, so something else was going on.\r\n\r\nAs for using the same fade time for texts, see https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/542.  In the Main panel, you might consider adding a tooltip or suchlike for \"Localize for tvOS 12 videos\". One user already asked here on GitHub what that does, and I suspect many more may wonder. Perhaps, \"Translates descriptions, if available, to your preferred language (as set in System Preferences : Language & Region)\"?  Hi!\r\n\r\nDid not find any info about this anywhere else: I cached all videos from a previous version (maybe 1.2), and just updated to 1.4 (~~which still displays `1.2` in the settings pane btw~~ edit: System prefs relaunch fixed it). I cached everything again, but now I have several version of the same videos:\r\n```\r\nold: comp_C007_C011_08244D_001_v01_6M_HB_tag0\r\nnew: comp_CH_C007_C011_PSNK_v02_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_2K_AVC\r\n\r\nold: comp_LA_A009_C009_t9_6M_tag0\r\nnew: comp_LA_A009_C009_PSNK_v02_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_2K_AVC\r\n\r\nold: comp_C002_C005_0818SC_001_v01_6M_HB_tag0\r\nnew: comp_CH_C002_C005_PSNK_v05_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_2K_AVC\r\n```\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nAren't the old version supposed to be deleted? Or are they still used in a way?\r\n\r\nAnd since I had the opportunity to compare, most of the new video are\u2026 worst than the originals (but I suppose it's on Apple side and it's definitely subjective):\r\n\r\n![sans-titre---1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/471627/46868215-84ac6a00-ce1f-11e8-9e4f-97f8dba6680c.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd should have say this first, but thanks so much for this stunning screensaver project! \u2764\ufe0f Personally, I would prefer that old videos not be purged, at least not automatically or by default. Time Machine does not back up files in (~)/Library/Caches, and if ever Apple remove any Aerial videos from their servers, then if Aerial purges them, they may be gone for good.\r\n\r\n(For example, if Apple had removed the 4K version of Dubai Night Two from their servers when they removed it from the tvOS 11 JSON - which was a strange thing to do, considering that video was the first one of two that Apple showed at the [tvOS 11 Keynote showing off the new 4K Aerials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmc45dpwOUw&feature=youtu.be&t=196)! - then those of us who had previously cached it would not be able to fall back upon it.)\r\n\r\nA reasonable solution might be to add a control to Aerial's Cache panel that the user can manually invoke to move unwanted versions of similar videos to the trash, perhaps with a message to review them before emptying the trash, cautioning that they will not have been backed up by Time Machine. I was interested in adding this folder to my Plex library. Purging unused videos would be great = delete anything other than the \"best available format\" for each video _enabled_.\r\n\r\nCan this be done inherently by deleting the entire cache manually and rebuild it? \r\nIf I \"Download Now\" will it only grab the \"best available format\" for each video enabled?\r\n\r\nOr how can we do so manually in the meantime? What I found confusing is that it doesn't tell you the cache status of each version of each video. And I think there are up to four versions now (?). It's a whole other world of logic.\r\n\r\nI tossed out everything not 4K. Plex is happy =)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-15 at 5 27 16 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40175/46985648-7da08880-d0b9-11e8-8bb7-c14e42abdf8f.png)  I have a 27\" iMac with an external 1080p display. All videos are cached.\r\n\r\nThe external display shows videos every time. It looks like the 4K files. They are super crisp(er than normal), with smoother motion and less mpeg artifacts.\r\n\r\nBut the main screen only some times plays videos. And they seem to be the 1080p version - motion not as smooth and I see mpeg artifacts.\r\n\r\nI would assume the opposite would happen because the external screen is 1080p and the internal screen has much higher resolution (but under 4k still).\r\n\r\nIn case this is a 4K issue, can you add an option to show the file name or other details - in addition to the \"Show descriptions\" option?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40175/46845810-0d3cf300-cdab-11e8-8b4b-c4a7b4a3e7df.png)\r\n I now have only 4K videos selected on the left. And Preferred = 4K. Sometimes the main display shows a video. Sometimes it does not.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that when the internal monitor (on the right) does not display a video, the external monitor (on the left) also does not display the video name. See attached.\r\n\r\nMaybe different options are in order:\r\n\r\nThe checkbox **Play different Aerial on each display** becomes a select \"**Play Aerials**\":\r\n- Only on main display\r\n- Mirrored on every display\r\n- Independently on each display\r\n\r\nThen the options w/in **Show Descriptions**:\r\n- 10 Seconds\r\n- Always\r\n- Debug (output the file name, codec, dimensions, etc)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40175/46874366-fd52fc80-ce06-11e8-9eb6-7b3f658566b3.png)\r\n\r\nI'm a web developer so I don't know the coding involved in native apps. Otherwise I'd make pull requests. Thank you for this awesome Screensaver! Earlier the video name was showing on both screens. Now just the internal screen - but only if the movie plays.\r\n\r\nI disabled the clock (and them also the video title) but that made no difference.\r\n\r\n\"Play different Aerial on each display\" gives odd results. Once it played on the internal only, and at like 1 frame per 3 seconds. Another time it played on the external screen only, smoothly, and with the video title on the external screen. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \r\n\r\nPerhaps these are all manifestations video card resource issues. That's why I was hoping for a \"main display only\" option.\r\n\r\n10.13.6, Late 2011 iMac 27\", 1080p external screen.\r\nI maxed everything out when I bought it, so the specs are pretty decent though starting to age...\r\n  Model Name:\tiMac\r\n  Model Identifier:\tiMac12,2\r\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core i7\r\n  Processor Speed:\t3.4 GHz\r\n  Number of Processors:\t1\r\n  Total Number of Cores:\t4\r\n  L2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\r\n  L3 Cache:\t8 MB\r\n  Memory:\t16 GB\r\n  Boot ROM Version:\tIM121.004F.B00\r\n  SMC Version (system):\t1.72f2 Yes, the name _was_ appearing on both screens in mirror mode. But that seems to have stopped now. Installed and works very well! I used a hot corner to test it over 10 times and it never failed once - Main display only, always show title, prefer 4K, only 4K videos selected.\r\n\r\nSometimes the framerate drops just slightly then picks up again. But I was expecting that with an older iMac. The display is still beautiful though!\r\n\r\nIt's weird how the clock is an option outside of each screen saver. It takes no visual style into account. Done. This is what I found, using only 4K videos...\r\n\r\n**1.4.1 TEST2**\r\nMirrored: The same video plays on both. Very smooth. The title is only on the main screen.\r\nDifferent: Frames being dropped (as expected).\r\nAlso, the fade effect only works on the main screen.\r\n\r\n**1.4.1 BETA1**\r\nIf I click Preview the screens go blank. The system is unresponsive. I hear a beep. The desktop comes back on and the System Preferences are gone.\r\nIf I use a hot corner the screens go blank. Then grey apples appear, one on each screen. > Sorry about that then. Everytime, independant of mirror etc ?\r\n\r\nYep. I even quit Prefs, reinstalled, etc. I figured it was Aerial crashing and the system picking the default apple screen saver. Fades and Titles worked in Test2. Sorry I can't help you! Ok.\r\nWhen mirrored: The external monitor shows the first frame full brightness, then total black and then fades in.\r\nWhen different: Videos don't play but I see the titles on both screen. That was b2.\r\n\r\nb3...\r\n\r\nMirrored: still the same issue with the first frame being full brightness before the fade-in.\r\nDifferent: Works as expected. Both screens fade from black. Lower framerate, but plays fine otherwise. Yes - fixed.

Looking forward to it! [Any updates?](http://gph.is/1TqiIcG)  Aerial 1.4b9\r\n\r\nYesterday, I saw the same Aerial video play twice in a row, out of 13 selected. More than once, I've seen the same video repeat after only one intervening video.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible, when the screen saver activates, for Aerial to build a randomized list of selected videos for Aerial to cycle through, so that no video is repeated before all selected videos have been played?\r\n\r\nIdeally, upon reactivation Aerial would rebuild the list with a newly randomized order. This was seen with v1.4b9, which didn't offer the day/night restriction. I had all 13 space videos selected, and no others. So far, I haven't seen any repeats with version 1.4. Thank you!  Aerial 1.4 beta 11 (from [glouel/Aerial](https://github.com/glouel/Aerial))\r\n\r\nWith preferred video format set to 4K HEVC, Aerial 1.4b11 caches and plays the 1080p H.264 version of Dubai Night Two (http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_DB_D011_D009_SIGNCMP_v15_6Mbps.mov) instead of my already cached 4K HEVC version (https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D011_C009_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov).\r\n\r\nI see that the 4K HEVC version does not currently appear in the .json files for tvOS 10, 11, or 12, but it must have done so at some point, since [esetnik/Aerial](https://github.com/esetnik/Aerial) v1.3 cached it on 11 January 2018.\r\n\r\nThe 4K HEVC version is still on Apple's servers at the URL above.\r\n\r\nBased on a cursory check, this appears to be the only video for which Aerial 1.4b11 plays a 1080p version when I have a 4K version already cached.\r\n\r\n(Apologies if I posted this issue in the wrong place, but there seems to be no place to post issues at [glouel/Aerial](https://github.com/glouel/Aerial).) I can confirm that I wasn't doing anything special with my fork. Apple must have removed it from the JSON. I'm missing the Downtown LA Video (https://appleinsider.com/articles/17/12/07/apple-puts-4k-aerial-screen-saver-of-los-angeles-skyline-into-rotation-on-apple-tv-4k). It's running on a local appleTV, but it seems to be missing from the json file.  https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/521#issuecomment-427419327\r\n> I added \"may\" as the detection state is uncertain right now, per discussion on a couple of threads. The API only allows to test for HEVC, not specifically HEVC Main10 profile (so it answers yes on my iMac despite not being supported). I can make it green again if you think that's better, but leaving the may (I think the extra description I gave should be enough warning)\r\n\r\nWe could consider implementing a HEVC Main10 hardware whitelist and fallback to \"may\" since it seems that we don't have a good way to determine the support level programmatically.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe we can implement a heuristic to predict support. E.g. play one of the cached videos for 30s and monitor CPU usage of the VTDecoderXPCService. The difference between partial and full Main10 support is significant. I get 1.4% CPU during 4k HEVC Main10 playback on my 2018 MBP.\r\n Part of the motivation for this is to launch Aerial with a sensible set of defaults for the system. A large majority of issues filed on the project are related to playback performance problems due to missing hardware support. HEVC Main10 causes major performance issues on all hardware without full support so I think we should default Aerial to 1080p H.264 (or maybe 1080p HEVC) on any device which fails the whitelist. Is this ready to be closed? @glouel   @glouel , you are amazing! great work man.. hopefully you have a way for people to 'contribute' to your cause.. one thing I'd like to ask about this is for the time settings pane, could the time be dependent on time formatting set in the clock settings:? currently it is displaying in 24-hour, not AM/PM. other than that, the expanded settings are amazing.  @glouel I just built #521. Aside from 2 compiler warnings it's looking good to me.\r\n\r\nA few points of feedback:\r\n1. You don't need to close and open separate PRs. It's possible with Github to update an existing PR. All you need to do is push your commits to the same branch and the PR will automatically update. Not sure if you're aware of that but it might help.\r\n2. I love that all the videos are available now, but the video selection screen is a bit confusing. It's unclear to me when I'm choosing the videos from the list whether I'm choosing 4k or 1080p content. Also what happens if I choose the \"Prefer 4k\" option? Maybe we should just indicate next to each video whether it's 1080p or 4k with a little tag in the list? Then we can just let people selectively choose which videos they want. If they want all 4k they can just unselect the 1080p ones. If they want all videos, they can select them all. I know there are a few overlaps (videos that have both 1080p and 4k versions), so we'd want to group those so they can uncheck the 1080p variant.\r\n3. The text descriptions are blurry on my Retina MBP 2018. Maybe we need to do a scale factor on the text element?\r\n4.

This is makes them difficult to see due to the low contrast difference.\n\n\n- What does the tvOS12 localise option do? Perhaps a help widget to explain, if possible?\n\nThe video and description fades are gorgeous, by the way.\n\n> On 06 Oct 2018, at 11:47, Guillaume Louel <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> (what a lovely mess, thanks sublime merge for getting me out of it \ud83e\udd15 )\n> \n> @dVIAN13 <https://github.com/dVIAN13> can you check this build and let me know if the AM/PM thing is fixed for you ?\n> https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta12/Aerial.saver.zip <https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4beta12/Aerial.saver.zip>\n> Tentative fix for Night Shift dates not displayed correctly on AM/PM systems\n> Fix garbled day/night icons on non retina displays\n> Tentative contentScale on AVPlayerLayer (looks slightly sharper on retina displays)\n> Fix video list cached indicators not getting refreshed when downloading new videos or changing preferred video format\n> Added labels & legend for clarity\n> Temporary changed the icon to a + for <10.12.2 compatibility\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/521#issuecomment-427560770>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AHM46Bm84oE1bDtp0wTDtoR0ecQAkiS5ks5uiHwsgaJpZM4XKeV1>.\n> \n\n @glouel, the AM/PM are there!, thank you!\r\n<img width=\"603\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-06 at 12 34 01 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46575150-b6778980-c964-11e8-86bc-3ca2fa25a568.png\">\r\n\r\ngreat job and continue to keep up the work.

See screen cap.\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screenshot-12\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43652726/46681642-87e5f280-cba0-11e8-94ce-5b00371bc3a8.png\">\r\n Yes, looks like it is some kind of issue with the downloads.

The ability to download them one at a time was a great idea for this type of issue. Thank you. @glouel Yes, small file sizes and the preview image in Finder was incomplete. They also didn\u2019t run in QT. Guillaume, for the sake of consistency, I would suggest standardizing capitalization:\r\n\r\n1. In the Main panel, change \"Preferred Video Format\" to \"Preferred video format\"\r\n2. In the Main panel, change \"Play Different Aerial On Each Display\" to \"Play different Aerial [_or_ aerial] on each display\", thereby matching the capitalization on the other checkbox descriptions\r\n3. In the Time panel, change all four occurrences of \"MacOS\" to \"macOS\"\r\n4. In the Cache panel, change \"Cache Aerials As They Play\" to \"Cache Aerials [_or_ aerials] as they play\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in the Time panel, remove the space before the colon in \"Aerial can display day and night videos based on time :\" (changing \"time :\" to \"time:\").\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to think that the current error message \"Video preview streaming is disabled\" is sufficient, since the message should appear only if the user does not have the video cached.\r\n\r\n(Speaking as a writer and editor, I have to say that your English seems better than that of most of my fellow native English speakers!) Grammatically, \"Preview streaming is disabled\" and \"Video preview streaming is disabled\" are equally correct, but I do think the longer form is needlessly wordy; \"Preview streaming is disabled\" is just as clear and better for being shorter.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I too dislike \"macOS\"; medial capitals (aka \"InterCaps\") in English, especially when the first letter is uncapitalized, strike me as silly and pretentious. Alas, marketing creatures are addicted to them.\r\n\r\n\"Check Only Cached\" and \"Check Cached Only\" (likewise \"Check Only 4K\" and \"Check 4K Only\") are equally correct grammatically, and sound equally good to me. (The only variation I would avoid is \"Only Check Cached\", where the \"only\" modifies \"check\" rather than \"cached\".)\r\n\r\nThank you for your most refreshing attention to detail!  Does anyone know the reason for removing San Francisco aerial screensaver in the latest build?\r\nAny way to get it back? I second this request.\r\nWhile the ISS videos are very pretty, I prefer the originals. Even if it is only playing the cached copied it would be great.  Excellent.

To work around the bug:\r\n* select the Aerial screensaver in System Preferences\r\n* close System Preferences with Aerial selected\r\n* reopen System Preferences and the preview should work now\r\n\r\n### Mac won't sleep with Aerial as screensaver\r\n\r\nIf your Mac won't sleep while Aerial is the selected screensaver, then you probably have an older version of Aerial installed. Download the latest verson of Aerial here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/ Make sure to check both locations for the old version, it can be installed to `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/User/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`.\r\n\r\n### Corrupted playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting corrupted playback when the screensaver starts then that is a new bug in macOS High Sierra. It appears to be a problem with the Intel drivers in High Sierra. As a workaround tick the \"Show with clock\" option as that seems to eliminate the corruption for the moment. Discussed extensively here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/377\r\n\r\n### No playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting a crossed out play icon instead of the preview or the videos just never seem to load, please check that a firewall or proxy isn't blocking the screensavers access to the videos. Trying the following two URLs in a web browser might show if they are blocked. If you are on a Macbook you can also try caching the videos on another network to test whether it is your network provider that is blocking access.\r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\nhttp://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\n The screen saver works great for me even on Mojave, but when I open it up and go to make a chance, I press \"Done\" but nothing happens.  The only way out is to do a force quit.  Hopefully it will be a simple fix.  Thanks. Thanks John.  I'm not sure how to find out which version I have.  I don't\nsee anything in apps and when I open the options in the screen saver area\nthis is all I see.\n\nI'll try the beta.\n\nLove this thing.  Thanks so much!\n\n\n\n[image: Screen Shot 2018-09-29 at 10.00.17 AM.png]\n\nOn Sat, Sep 29, 2018 at 1:42 AM Guillaume Louel <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Which version ?

Observed your known issues, however I do not use 'show always'. Great work @ starting the auto-detection of hardware decoding. Looking forward to future updates. Tested out, and it looks great! great work! some things I have observed(not necessarily related to this build).. The RAM hit I take when running the system pref pane with this open(maybe a macOS issue), and then after previewing.. I went from 8GB free RAM to about 3.5. afterwards, it climbs back up.. not sure if there is some type of memory leak? and also, I am wondering how I tell if it's streaming the video vs. playing the cached file? the video seems slightly choppy.. I am running this on a dual monitor (both 2560x1440) connected to an eGPU. here is a video showing what I am talking about. first, I direct play the cached video. next I 'preview' the screen saver. note how choppy it is..

FYI, the high usage for quicktime is the screen recording. @glouel love the hard work. The project is getting better by the day \ud83d\udc4d  @glouel installed latest test build and this is what I get... not working for me ;)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-02 at 10 12 56 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46364940-1223d900-c62c-11e8-9650-6a2449a5781a.png\">\r\n<img width=\"667\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-02 at 10 13 03 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46364943-16e88d00-c62c-11e8-9c9c-9b35f909a008.png\">\r\n<img width=\"664\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-02 at 10 13 40 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46364946-18b25080-c62c-11e8-9105-af88ab1b522c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n I believe so..\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1095\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-02 at 10 21 25 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/46365291-0a186900-c62d-11e8-90a2-0ff0395214dc.png\">\r\n no, it does not. I even tried uninstalling(removing the file from my screen savers directory.) I had your last beta(1.41b2) running prior to updating.  I deleted all related files to aerial and it appears to have resolved the issue. ;) I may have inadvertently installed v1.2 over your old beta thinking it was the newest build.. and then installed your latest beta over that.. that probably explains it..  @glouel - is the plan to continue to support the brew cask install on the README?  I can create a PR to https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/aerial.rb but wanted to know when the 1.4 versions will be out of pre-release? @alock create a PR whenever Aerial drops the prerelease tag :)\r\nNobody owns casks. Yea I really just want to know why 1.4 is still in pre-release no issues for me. :) @glouel the biggest reason for holding back 1.4 from general release is the loss of previous content that people expected. Since you've solved that in #521, I'd be comfortable releasing 1.4 as soon as that gets finalized, tested, and merged.  ## Screen Saver Options won't close\r\nMinor issue, but after opening the Screen Saver Options from System Preferences, the done button does not close the Options view. This causes the System Preferences app to hang and not close unless you use a force quit. This started happening after the latest Mojave OS update.\r\n\r\n  OS X 10.14 Mojave's System Preferences stalls whenever the screen saver options window for Aerial opens. This is because the \"done\" button does not operate. You can still change the options, minimize the window, and hide the System Preferences app, but the window itself will not close once opened. The only way go back to screen savers is by force quitting System Preferences. Once the System Preferences app has been reopened, the selected screen saver is the previous screen saver chosen before Aerial was selected.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-09-27 at 3 27 18 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43653949/46170047-b8599280-c26a-11e8-997c-bba757b0e390.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nBefore logging an issue please check if one of the problems you are experiencing is mentioned here.

Hi!\r\n\r\nI'm using @glouel's latest build on Mojave on a late 2014 13\" MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nI've set it to 1080p and display different videos on each of my 2 displays and it works fine, but during video playback (also in the settings app) the VTDecoderXPCService task creates a very high cpu load.\r\n\r\nI thing playing two 1080p videos shouldn't be that taxing or am I wrong? Thanks a lot! With H264 my cpu load is fine!  When I first installed the beta of Aerial for Mojave and tvOS 12 screen saver support, I was greeted with slideshow performance on my 3-display 2013 MacBook Pro. This all cleared up when I switched from the new 4K default back to 1080p - my poor MacBook with integrated graphics can't push that much video apparently. However, the only reason I knew that toggle was there was because I'd been reading a few issue threads in here. I imagine a lot of people won't know this, and the default to 4K will not serve them well. All they know is performance tanked.\r\n\r\nI'd request an \"Auto\" setting to dynamically choose 1080p videos for any screen 1920px wide (or less), and 4K videos for screens above that resolution. No sense in pushing 4K video where it's not visible. If possible, handle this on a monitor-by-monitor basis. Is it only 1080p at this point? It looks really grainy on my LG 5K display. I wouldn't have a problem with using 12GB.  The 13\" MacBook Pro only had [integrated graphics](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP691), and being as old as it is I'm pretty sure I don't have HEVC capability. Screen savers display fine on 1080p for me, including the lovely new ISS ones. Oddly, previewing even 4K HEVC files in Quicklook is buttery smooth, although that is one video at a time.\r\n\r\nHere's my Aerial movie cache:\r\nb1-1.mov\r\nb1-2.mov\r\nb1-3.mov\r\nb1-4.mov\r\nb2-1.mov\r\nb2-2.mov\r\nb2-3.mov\r\nb2-4.mov\r\nb3-1.mov\r\nb3-2.mov\r\nb3-3.mov\r\nb4-1.mov\r\nb4-2.mov\r\nb4-3.mov\r\nb5-1.mov\r\nb5-2.mov\r\nb5-3.mov\r\nb6-1.mov\r\nb6-2.mov\r\nb6-3.mov\r\nb6-4.mov\r\nb7-1.mov\r\nb7-2.mov\r\nb7-3.mov\r\nb8-1.mov\r\nb8-2.mov\r\nb8-3.mov\r\nb9-3.mov\r\nb10-3.mov\r\ncomp_A001_C004_1207W5_v23_SDR_FINAL_20180706_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A001_C004_1207W5_v23_SDR_FINAL_20180706_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A009_C001_010181A_v09_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180725_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A009_C001_010181A_v09_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180725_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A083_C002_1130KZ_v04_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180725_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A083_C002_1130KZ_v04_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180725_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A103_C002_0205DG_v12_SDR_FINAL_20180706_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A105_C003_0212CT_FLARE_v10_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180711_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A108_C001_v09_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A114_C001_0305OT_v10_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_A114_C001_0305OT_v10_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_C002_C005_0818SC_001_v01_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_C007_C004_0824AJ_001_v01_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_C007_C011_08244D_001_v01_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_CH_C002_C005_PSNK_v05_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_CH_C002_C005_PSNK_v05_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_CH_C007_C004_PSNK_v02_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_CH_C007_C011_PSNK_v02_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_CH_C007_C011_PSNK_v02_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_DB_D001_C001_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_DB_D001_C005_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_DB_D002_C003_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_DB_D008_C010_v04_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_DB_D011_C010_v10_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_DB_D011_D009_SIGNCMP_v15_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_GL_G010_C006_v08_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_GMT026_363A_103NC_E1027_KOREA_JAPAN_NIGHT_v17_SDR_FINAL_25062018_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT026_363A_103NC_E1027_KOREA_JAPAN_NIGHT_v17_SDR_FINAL_25062018_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT306_139NC_139J_3066_CALI_TO_VEGAS_v07_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT306_139NC_139J_3066_CALI_TO_VEGAS_v07_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT308_139K_142NC_CARIBBEAN_DAY_v09_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT312_162NC_139M_1041_AFRICA_NIGHT_v14_SDR_FINAL_20180706_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT329_113NC_396B_1105_CHINA_v04_SDR_FINAL_20180706_F900F2700_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_GMT329_117NC_401C_1037_IRELAND_TO_ASIA_v48_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180725_F0F6300_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_HK_B005_C011_t9_6M_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_HK_H004_C008_v10_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_HK_H004_C010_4k_v01_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_HK_H004_C013_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A005_C009_PSNK_ALT_v08_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_2K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A005_C009_PSNK_ALT_v08_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A005_C009_v05_t9_6M.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A006_C004_v01_SDR_FINAL_PS_20180730_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A006_C008_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A008_C004_ALT_v33_6Mbps.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A009_C009_PSNK_v02_SDR_PS_FINAL_20180709_SDR_4K_HEVC.mov\r\ncomp_LA_A009_C009_t9_6M_tag0.mov\r\ncomp_LW_L001_C006_t9_6M_tag0.mov\r\nDB_D001_C001_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nDB_D001_C001_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nDB_D001_C005_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nDB_D002_C003_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nDB_D002_C003_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nDB_D008_C010_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nDB_D011_C010_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nGL_G002_C002_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nGL_G002_C002_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nGL_G004_C010_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_B005_C011_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_B005_C011_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C001_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C001_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C008_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C008_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C010_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C010_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C013_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nHK_H004_C013_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nLA_A006_C008_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nLA_A006_C008_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nLA_A008_C004_2K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nLA_A008_C004_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\nplate_G002_C002_BG_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov I should also note, checking the horizontal resolution is probably a better idea than vertical, owing to so many 16x10 monitors out there. Otherwise you'll scale up to 4K needlessly on the common 1920x1200 resolution. I also have moderate cpu and high gpu load on my 2016 MacBook TouchBar with the Radeon Pro 455 connected to the LG UltraFine 5k display on macOS 10.14. It ramps up the fan very noticeably. It sometimes even drops frame.\r\n\r\nI cached all videos in 4k HEVC.\r\n\r\nShouldn't it be very smooth and non-taxin, due to hardware HEVC decoding support? @glouel 1st: thank you for the awesome and really quick issue support/reaction!\r\n\r\nI already tried playing the video via quicktime.

Select Desktop & Screen Saver\r\n3. Select Aerial screen saver\r\n4. Select Screen Saver Options\r\n5. Make necessary changes\r\n6. Click Done\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nNo response when clicking done.

Those were my favorites. Until then, I am sticking back to the old release. Yes. I am primary pissed that over half of the videos got removed. Unless the bugs are doing harm for my iMac's HD, I am keeping the previous version I download yesterday that has all the extra media. I will update the screen saver only when my favorite cities I love come back as I feel the space videos are not as interesting.  i dont know where to put this but i want to check if it is possible to get the new tvos 12 videos.  This is a duplicate of #463   I have the new videos.  If I add them to the Cache folder will ArialSaver see and display them or do I need to add the links with code? @johnnyblair If you are able to make the screensaver see the videos in the cache folder, would you mind sharing them?  Or pointing me to where you found them?  Thanks!  A whole bunch of new Aerial screensavers were introduced in tvOS 12 including NASA images.  None of these are being picked up. That's what I was thinking, also.  This screen saver is amazing.  The pictures are amazing.  I just want to know where they are, when the screensaver is playing.\r\n\r\nCan you add the name of the location when the image shows up?  (Maybe for just the first few seconds)?  Maybe this can be an option in the settings?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nAshley Hi @akingon, this feature has already been implemented in a fork, check out issue #389. \r\nScreenshots of this fork can be found at https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/285#issuecomment-313548977  Just installed the app and it says \"cannot use with this version of MacOS\"\r\n\r\nAny update coming ? It's a bug in macOS. It works fine in 10.13.6.\r\n\r\n- Select Aerial\r\n- Close System Preferences\r\n- Reopen System Preferences\r\n\r\nDoes the preview work now? the preview works but in normal mode, the screensaver crashes after a few minutes. hope a fix is in the pipeline soon. love this screensaver.. \u4e00\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u6c42\u7b54\u6848 Same problem.  crashes after a few seconds on 10.13.6 @crts-failure @carter3d What do you mean when you say it crashes? Do you get an error message? No error codes, the video freezes- which isn\u2019t ideal considering it\u2019s a screensaver. \r\n\r\nI initially had problems with how the video was being displayed, as in some sort of rendering or graphics issue (the video was pixelated and enlarged) but turning on the clock fixed this. Only to later discover it hangs after some time.  @crts-failure Thanks. So are you running the latest version? Do you have the videos cached? Are you behind a corporate firewall or anything like that? When it crashes, my screen looks like the attached image.  But, after further testing, this only seems to occur when using the default resolution on my 13-inch, 2017 MacBook Pro and the built-in display.  When I connect to my Thunderbolt display (via a dock) at 2560x1440 resolution, the screen save runs fine.\r\n![img_0427](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12088157/45318749-119b9500-b4fb-11e8-9cbe-4c478ab1162b.JPG)\r\n As for the other questions, I removed the previous version and installed the latest from Git on Saturday.  Not sure if videos are cached or not (how do I check?), and not behind a firewall that I know of.  Like I said, it seems to work fine on the same system when using a different display. @carter3d If you tick the \"Show with clock\" option does that clear up the corruption? @alistairmcmillian im running this on my home pc so no corporate firewall. Tried removing and reinstalling, caching videos but no joy. It was running fine in the past so I suspect macOS update caused the corruption. I never got the garbled screen @carter3d did. I\u2019m running at full res on a retina MacBook.  show with clock seems to solve the issue @carter3d have you left the screensaver running for a few minutes to see whether you have the same issues as I have? (Screen freeze) Wow, \"Show with Clock\" solved my dual display resolution issue! @crts-failure If the videos are being cached you should find a bunch of files in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Cache/Aerial`. Is there anything there?\r\n\r\n@carter3d @adminjwilson The new graphics drivers in High Sierra caused a bunch of graphics problems for people running Aerial. For some reason \"Show with clock\" seems to fix them. Yes, all the video files are cached but I still find the videos freeze after a few minutes of it running.  @crts-failure , I have not let the screensaver for more than a few minutes (when it isn't working).  When it is working, I don't have any issues, even after long periods of time. I've also been having problems with Aerial ever since I updated to MacOS 10.13.6 (months ago, admittedly).\r\n\r\nIt _works_, but jerkily/with flickers. The videos will play, but every few seconds it looks like they are... imploding, for lack of a better description. The image on-screen gets \"sucked toward the centre\" of the monitor, then will go back to fullsize, rinse repeat.\r\n\r\nI downloaded and installed the newest version of Aerial - no idea which version I'd had installed so far - and the problem persists. @kerstin What happens if you tick the \u201cShow with clock\u201d option? Does that help? @alistairmcmillan With the clock added, the issue is indeed gone. Is this just a temporary workaround or will users with that OS version have to keep the clock around? @kerstin It's been this way since the release of High Sierra in September last year. Apple re-wrote the display server that draws everything to the screen and introduced this bug then. I'm not sure if its fixed in Mojave, maybe someone else can confirm that. @alistairmcmillan I upgraded not too long ago, so not looking to upgrade again all too soon. (: I think I was more wondering if it would be possible to replicate whatever the clock contributes to fixing the issue (but in the form of, say, a transparent overlay, or hidden pixel or similar). @glouel I just tried it - seems to work fine now, thank you! Interestingly, the problem is still present when _previewing_ the screensaver, however. Just thought I'd mention it. Sure thing! And yeah, I meant the preview one gets to see when one clicks the preview button.\r\n\r\nI'm on High Sierra (10.13.6) with a not super recent (several years old) MacBook Air (so no Retina display) with the default resolution and not using multiple displays, though I could try using multi displays if that might help with narrowing down the problem. No, the preview shows the screensaver normally, but with the bug. I tried it again now, had to wait a few seconds to see the images distorted (yesterday it happened immediately) but the problem is still there, in the preview.\r\n\r\nI watched the _actual_ screensaver for a good 2 minutes? without anything happening, so assumed it was fine (when it was buggy, you'd see the distortions happening every few seconds). But I'll try to have an eye on it and report back. Thank you!! That worked perfectly, it's running on a very old (early 2011) macbook pro with the discrete card disabled, thank you so much for that most recent one! you're the best!!\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any way you could hook into f.lux to determine the sunset/sunrise times? That would be dope :) For me, the latest version (v1.4.2test4) reintroduced the twitching of the screensaver (it continued to be present in the preview too). I've now downgraded to v1.4 again.  ## Known Issues\r\n\r\nBefore logging an issue please check if one of the problems you are experiencing is mentioned here. If the issue you are experiencing isn't covered here, then please delete this content and tell us about the problem you are experiencing or the feature you'd like to request.\r\n\r\n### \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X.\" message\r\n\r\nIf you get a message saying `You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.` that is a known bug with macOS that was reported to Apple in April 2016 as [rdar://25569037](http://openradar.appspot.com/25569037). As of November 2017 the bug is still not fixed. To work around the bug:\r\n* select the Aerial screensaver in System Preferences\r\n* close System Preferences with Aerial selected\r\n* reopen System Preferences and the preview should work now\r\n\r\n### Mac won't sleep with Aerial as screensaver\r\n\r\nIf your Mac won't sleep while Aerial is the selected screensaver, then you probably have an older version of Aerial installed. Download the latest verson of Aerial here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/ Make sure to check both locations for the old version, it can be installed to `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/User/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`.\r\n\r\n### Corrupted playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting corrupted playback when the screensaver starts then that is a new bug in macOS High Sierra. It appears to be a problem with the Intel drivers in High Sierra. As a workaround tick the \"Show with clock\" option as that seems to eliminate the corruption for the moment. Discussed extensively here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/377\r\n\r\n### No playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting a crossed out play icon instead of the preview or the videos just never seem to load, please check that a firewall or proxy isn't blocking the screensavers access to the videos. Trying the following two URLs in a web browser might show if they are blocked. If you are on a Macbook you can also try caching the videos on another network to test whether it is your network provider that is blocking access.\r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\nhttp://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\n  Really appreciate the work you do, awesome screensaver.

Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\r\n-- Desktop & Screen Saver Duplicate of #464   Aerial screensaver will not work with OSX 10.14 Beta 4. I believe it stopped working with the update. I do understand these are betas but I enjoy the project so much I was just looking to get it working.\r\n\r\nTim Duplicate of https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/464  On AppleTV 4K, you can swipe left or right to browse other aerials.  The name/location of the aerial is also displayed.  It would be nice to include a similar feature to this screensaver.\r\n @fashnbly-l8 I'm not sure if it's possible to intercept keyboard events during screensaver playback. Do you have any examples of other screensavers that are interactive? It might be dangerous to intercept keyboard events since they are usually designed to interrupt screensaver playback and restore the system to a wake state. If we did implement this feature we'd want to make sure that it's configurable and disabled by default. I think most users would expect that keyboard events will terminate screensaver playback. I remember seeing that behavior on a 3rd-party screensaver back in the 10.3 days. The arrow keys and a few other specific keys were used to cycle/modify settings. For the life of me, I can't remember the name of it. > On AppleTV 4K, you can swipe left or right to browse other aerials. The name/location of the aerial is also displayed.

After updated to this beta, a message saying `You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X.

I have applied the workaround as described in known bug but it still does not work... I have tried to re-install the latest saver but not work...

This also affects 3 other screensavers I have, looks to be any swift-based screensaver. So how are we supposed to make screen savers? Beta 4 just killed it in its entirety.

It fixed for me when updating to Mojave. Thank you!  If videos are not cached, this screensaver streams enormous files over network. Imagine you are traveling, getting your internet via tethering / personal hotspot and suddenly screen saver turned on your laptop - it can it up hundreds of megabytes/gigabytes of data before you realize it. That is dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere should be an option to disable streaming videos unless you are on wifi (non-hotspot one).\r\n\r\nYes you can cache videos, but - most people may not realize they have to. Also: the current cache feature downloads ALL videos, which now eats up gigabytes on your drive. It should be possible to only download select ones (just like you can select which ones you want to play). There are third-party utilities designed to trim data consumption. A temporary workaround might be to install something like [TripMode](https://www.tripmode.ch/) which I use personally for this purpose.  I tried using the fix below, and it did not work. I'm still getting the \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" message  Wanted to chime in...\r\n\r\nI did two experiments... On macOS 10.13.5 and 10.13.4 I had aerial installed already, all videos cached, I was able to upgrade to Mojave and Aerial was working great... It even runs the screen saver from the login screen and looks pretty neat...\r\n\r\nThe second experiment was imaging a Mac from scratch into Mojave and then installing Aerial, here, the SS didn't run and gave me the above error...\r\n I upgraded to Mojave and had it on High Sierra working but now its not...  Installed after upgrading to Mojave, getting the above error - even after following the steps provided Just installed on the Public Beta on Mojave. Workaround for the system preference does not appear to work, still prompts that it cannot be used with this version of macOS and Screen Saver Options not accessible.\r\n\r\nAerial works as a screensaver when selected, however there is a black bar of about an inch on the left while it's running. It's working fine during the lock screen but if cancelled the black bar reappears. This is on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, 10.14 Beta 18A314k). I just installed Mojave 10.14 Beta (18A314h) and Aerial works just fine for me, even the visual glitches (bars and scale problems) I was experiencing under High Sierra 10.13 disappeared! not works for me on Mojave 10.14 Beta - please update :-)\r\n\r\n still dead in b3 me too Upgraded from High Sierra to 10.14 public beta and I have this error now.

Happening on both this and Butterflight's configurator, but nothing else that I've seen.  My system is 10.13.6.  Aerial exhibits frozen video playback:\r\nOn macOS 10.13.4, Aerial plays video as soon as it engages and continues to do so until the display shutoff timer triggers. Tapping the shift key breaks out of the screen saver to a login prompt as usual.\r\nOn macOS 10.13.5, Aerial plays video for a variable length of time after engaging, then freezes. Tapping the shift key breaks out of the screen saver, returning to a login prompt as usual. I have this same issue on macOS 10.13.5. Video playback just _stops_ after a time and will not resume. Given that this puts a static image on my displays when it occurs, it limits Aerial's usefulness as a screensaver. Had this issue before under Sierra and a macOS update fixed it, now it seems to be back I believe it could be 10.13.5. Tried reinstalling aerial and re-caching vids but no luck. I got the same problem in 10.13.6, seems to freeze after a short while and after just looks like a static image. +1\r\nI'm having the same issue, also with macOS version 10.13.6 +1\r\nI'm having the same issue, +1\r\nI'm also having this issue on MacOS 10.13.6 Same 10.13.6 yes, bug is still there in 10.13.6  +1 (10.13.6) +1 same here on 10.13.5 and 10.13.6 +1 same on 10.13.6  On High Sierra (10.13.5) running on a MacBook Pro, 15 inc, 2017 - the screen saver options mage has tables and text cut off.

The workaround suggested above doesn't work here anymore (could also be a bug of the OS, but never experienced it with Sierra and High Sierra). I also never experienced any issues with it on Sierra or High Sierra.  So far on Mojave it works, but it does take a moment for the screen to actually unlock properly.  Maybe it's having some difficulty spinning down the aerial service as the unlock authentication completes.   Does it work in System Preferences screen-saver preview, as well? Cause...that one doesn't work for me. No, in System Preferences preview it shows the alert for me.  It works normally as it seems like the service is still running properly, just having some issues stopping as you authenticate.  I imagine the project owner could pull a new copy of the service from the upcoming tvOS & do this the same way.   Yep. So it's just the preview (and I suppose the actual screensaver settings) that don't work. But if you apply it, it will work. It's just that it won't stop properly when you try to authenticate.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, I hope the owner can fix this. Cause, at least to me, it's by far the best screensaver I've used so far.    The workaround for \"You cannot use this screensaver with this version of the OS\" doesn't appear to work in the 10.14 beta.\r\n\r\n(Not a complaint, it's a beta, more a heads-up) same message but work, some times stuck image Yeah, I think the author just needs to rip an updated version of the aerial service from the latest iteration of tvOS.  I imagine that will remedy this issue. Mine works fine (MB Pro 2015) @victorlobe Yeah, mine works too & honestly now it seems like the aerials service isn't having any issue any longer when I authenticate, so maybe it was just something hokey after the upgrade.  Will keep an eye out to see if it continues to be stable. you, no preview. no settings.. :( Didn\u2019t work me either on Mojave.

I get the same message when trying to use Google Featured Photos screen saver so it's not just Aerial that has the issue. Same same. \r\nalso, i realised i cant stand any other screensaver! risking burn in, but won't use the silly built-in savers!  This is not specific to Aerial, I've seen several people mentioning that 3rd party screensaver in general stopped working in b4. I think @cdstamper is right. I am anxiously waiting for the next beta. I also downloaded the original code and recompiled it on my computer with the latest Xcode 10 beta, and it still gave the same error.\r\n\r\nI still haven't changed my screen saver to anything else.

(same thing happened to Aerial Saver) for those who are stuck downloading the videos from \r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\r\n\r\nyou can use software like Downie to do it, idiot proof ;) https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie.php Yes it's been reported, and the original bug report got closed last week. Might see some progress in Beta 5 Just an update for the hopeful; Upgraded from Dev Beta 4 to Dev beta 5 of Mojave and did a clean install of Aerial. No dice- Still receiving the same error. \r\n\r\nOpening the code in XCode just proved that I know nothing yes, so I promptly closed it again. \ud83d\ude2d  I did a clean reinstall on Mojave b5 (18A347e) and re-downloaded all of the videos. The screensaver itself seems to work fine now, but the preferences pane won't close after clicking the \"Screen Saver Options\" button. Thanks to tobsenmilch, mikegazdag, & JonoHaysom for helping me to find a workaround. @grokdesigns Ive done a clean install of Aerial and it had no impact, looks the same as before, completely broken. did you compile the screensaver yourself or Simon download it? @snorbaard has the same issue I do. @JonoHaysom, I just downloaded the build from here and let it re-cache all of the videos. As I mentioned, you can't get out of the preference pane, so you have to force quit system preferences, but the screensaver itself seems to be working fine for me now. I wish I knew why that was since I seem to be the minority in this. Hey @JohnCoates and everyone.. the screensaver works perfectly again in Mojave beta 6. \r\n\r\njust wish we could get the location naming feature and the space videos from apple ;) Glad to see this.\r\nI was actually already updating my Mac when I saw this.

I think I may use both in mixed case, whereas some systems I may want to stream more than just the nice Apple aerials vs only streaming them.  I do like local content though, no need to stream stuff over & over again if you have any sort of cleanup tool that clears app buffers & temp data.  Just my 2\u00a2. Works in Beta 8 I can't get any quartz screensavers to work in Mojave. Any tips?  I hope you'll be doing whatever is necessary to support the new aerial screensavers! I love this screensaver so much! Space would be very nice! I'd love the new screensavers too, but it looks like this app is no longer being maintained? The current JSON manifest doesn't appear to include them yet, so either they haven't actually shipped those videos yet, or the new tvOS release uses a new URL. None of 3rd party screensavers seems to work with new Mojave, including this Aerial app.  \r\n<img width=\"337\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-06-05 at 00 13 25\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3215437/40946429-50a18d24-6855-11e8-8520-bf4798e247c9.png\">\r\n @WEZANGO it writes on the main page of the project about this issue. Try it, maybe it will work. Cheers! @remus-b unfortunately no luck. Also tried to delete and reinstall it, but still not working. Can anyone confirm tvOS 12 will even fetch the new videos yet? They may not be live at this point. Any updates on this? Would love to see the new ones on here some day! :) I saw the new video yesterday on my ATV, but definitely the url seems to be different since we don't get them in the json files that are in use (neither the one with 4K videos). http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/watch-all-the-apple-tv-aerial-video-screensavers#30047FDA-3AE3-4E74-9575-3520AD77865B \r\ncan someone painstakingly create a gist to download all the videos using youtube downloader?\r\n\r\nshould be\r\n```shell\r\nbrew install youtubedl\r\n\r\nyoutubedl  http://youtube.com/link......\r\n``` <img width=\"1007\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-19 at 9 44 02 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/289994/45790894-27c0f800-bc55-11e8-8e13-23c7c746dadc.png\">\r\nhttps://sylvan.apple.com/Videos/comp_A114_C001_0305OT_v10_SDR_FINAL_22062018_SDR_2K_AVC.mov\r\n I think what we actually need is the new JSON url from Apple. This is the original one:\r\n\r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\r\n\r\nThat one doesn't have the new stuff. That's the root of the issue. So what is the new one? Would any little birdies like to tell us? If someone here has an AppleTV and can run its traffic through a VPN you control, you could probably see where it's going to get the list of videos to play. This guy has them: http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/watch-all-the-apple-tv-aerial-video-screensavers The page at benjaminmayo.co.uk is using this JSON feed:\r\n\r\nhttp://benjaminmayo.co.uk/scripts/apple-tv-screensavers.json\r\n\r\nBut that one isn't provided by Apple, and thus might fall out-of-date with the real thing. I presume we won't get an update until we have the actual Apple feed's new URL.\r\n\r\nSo, hey @benjaminmayo, what's the new URL? The format changed somewhat; you need to extract the JSON out of here https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/resources.tar. The JSON includes the URLs to the videos and the time markers for the tvOS 12 captions as a dictionary, keyed by time. The values of this dictionary are keys which can be found in the strings plists. Thanks seems to be working, with the exception of the \"Done\" button. > I investigated the Done button a bit but couldn't find anything particular, I assume it's another bug linked to Swift screensavers in Mojave, I'll try submitting a radar next week with a small sample project.\r\n> \r\n> In the meantime, pushed a new version with a few features :\r\n> \r\n> * 1080p and 4K support (you can switch in cache panel)\r\n> * optional video description displayed (bottom left of the screen at video start\r\n> * tweaked the path selector's color for dark mode in cache panel (was barely readable)\r\n> \r\n> Build here : https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4b5/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nAwesome stuff! the new videos work perfectly for me. thanks for work you've put into this Thank you very much @glouel for the work you've put into this - the earth from space video looks amazing on my MacBook! great job @glouel !  @glouel Thank you so much. I spent a day trying all possibilities to terminate the sheet and didn't think about this one.\r\n @glouel Thank you so much! I was so excited to add these new stunning ISS screen savers after tvOS 12 released to this old app. @glouel thanks for your update!!! @glouel when I try your latest release on Mojave I get a warning \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver on this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" Any ideas?\r\n\r\nEdit: Nevermind, tracked it down to https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/487 The Done button works in 1.4b7!! @glouel  Feature request - would it be possible to optionally allow the video description to remain showing rather than fading off after a few seconds please? I often miss the start of the videos but would still like to know where each location is. \r\nThanks! Superb!!! Thank you very much @glouel !!\r\n\r\nLots of work colleagues keep gawking at these amazing aerial videos on my laptop (especially the earth ones), and it's thanks to your efforts they work really well with no more bugs on my Mojave build. I really like the ability to display a different video on each screen too! It's all very distracting so really must get back to doing actual work. :)  Sorry but I don't have the \"always\" option next to \"show descriptions\" :-( > > Sorry but I don't have the \"always\" option next to \"show descriptions\" :-(\r\n> \r\n> It's in beta 8 :\r\n> https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/1.4b8/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\nReloaded and voila!

So great a screensaver to have. I can't fathom why Apple hasn't made this standard on MacOS\u2026 I'm running the new 1.4b8 version and it looks great! Thanks Guys! I did have a thought. I'm a little concerned about enabling the location display to always as it fixes it into the lower corner all the time. It should be changed frequently enough to prevent any burn in I suppose, but to be safe and for aesthetic reasons has anyone considered styling the location display like the floating clock and having it drift around too? > * I have a branch that brings back tvOS11 4K screensavers. Sad thing is, and I should have checked before... they are nearly all in the tvOS12 JSON already \ud83d\ude05 There's one desert video (and I don't remember the other one) that aren't included in the tvOS12 JSON. Because it was a quick hack and it didn't bring much, I didn't push that branch. If the video list gets fixed (see above), we could also add back the tvOS10 videos (the originals). Those are 1080p H264 only though.\r\n\r\nI'm missing those early screensavers now... (London / the one that flies from the sea to a green valley / SF bridge / etc). Here's hoping you're able to work out a way to include those back in as well please. :)\r\n   Also having this issue.

Read the [comment docs](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/pull-request-comments).\n @glouel Added a Show in finder option in 1.4.1  I'm seeing a network where 5-6 computers using this screensaver have downloaded about 2TB of MOV files.  Is it possible the latest version has some cache issue that is preventing cache from operating correctly, and having the same files downloaded over and over? I have run into this as well.  Downloads constantly while screensaver is showing.  MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) Touch Bar\r\nMacOs 10.13.4\r\nWhen using default setting display error\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7507079/38845669-2786a992-422b-11e8-8df0-a2782082838a.png)\r\nBut using scaled display settings (Only More Space 1680 x 1050 setting) display correct. I have the same issue I was able to fix that issue by turning on the clock in the screensaver settings \ud83d\ude02 \r\nI have no idea why, but it really fixes the issue, but now since the last update I have a similar issue, it seems the resolution doesn't fit anymore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7093028/38984140-3b5727fc-43c6-11e8-8eda-0d6df5ea1d88.png)\r\n\r\nOn my bigger screen (Ultrawide 34 inches) I have those bars left and right @funfried you are right, fix too.\ud83d\ude02 I have the same issue as @funfried  Ty, @funfried! Works \ud83d\ude04  @funfried  hah ,its works I have the same issue as @funfried - but I've been using the clock to deal with High Sierra issues for some time. So it is still broken for me. Sounds like 10.13.4 has broken something (again). Any plans to fix? [I also have 13\" Touch Bar MacBook Pro] Got the same issue, when using external display the main macbook pro 13\" display keeps flipping continuously between fullscreen (filled/stretched) and the original aspect ratio of the video (black bars top and bottom).  I also have this issue on MacBook Pro 13\" with Touch Bar. It can be fixed by turning on clock on screensaver (thank you @funfried) I had the issue where the resolution of the video was incorrect - it would \"zoom in\". When I add the clock, it is as expected.  The Android [Aerial Dream](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codingbuffalo.aerialdream&hl=en) app has a feature that shows the title and (exact) location of the video (e.g. `LAX airport, Los Angeles, USA`) in the lower left corner as an overlay.\r\n\r\nWould be a beautiful addition.  The original Apple TV screensaver chooses scenes based on local time:\r\n\r\n> As Apple said when it introduced the new Apple TV in September, all of these screensavers are dynamic, and day and night shots actually change depending on your local time.\r\n\r\nWould be a nice addition (optional with checkbox) And a \"select all night scenes\" for manual select only night scenes.\r\n\r\nsame for day scenes.   What bug are you experiencing?  I have a Mac Pro that is not connected to any network and would like to use the Aerial screen saver.\r\n\r\nI have copied all the videos from the Cache of a machine that has Aerial installed and installed them to the Cache folder on the Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get the Mac Pro to use just the Cached videos?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJoe\r\n Thanks! That's fantastic.  How can I get Aerial to play in 4K like the Apple TV on the iMac Pro? Duplicate of #378 but I second your bump! I wonder if they are going to be a update to make it run in 4K  Last time it was discussed, people started arguing about HDR vs non-HDR and the Issue was closed. Windows apparently has a 4K Aerial upgrade, but I'm not sure why development for this has stalled. how do we get someone to look into this? or get something started? We can't do much other than work on it ourselves or reach out to @JohnCoates.  Hi everyone. Love aerial. but since i moved my macbook pro retina over my 1080p asus monitor  and making them fit together, aerial is having trouble previewing it. on my asus monitor everything is fine but on my macbook now there are bars on top and on the bottom and the content is totally zoomed in. and when i enter my password you can see it goes back to its normal state without bars and zoom.\r\n\r\nvideo where i show the problem\r\nhttps://youtu.be/eErC_Aus0tI I am having the same issue You can close this, it's a duplicated from https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/442  On the menu, the text glitches into itself like this.\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-28 at 9 25 48 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36910989/36771482-28c16d10-1c6a-11e8-9abe-6f2ad944f051.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preview sometimes turns black like this.\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-28 at 9 25 57 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36910989/36771474-18e1a9aa-1c6a-11e8-8e51-a14a8b9cbbf0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe menu sometimes disappears and there are no check boxes.\r\n\r\nWhenever a video ends, the screen turns black for half a second and the video resizes itself. i had this issues too, is there some way out?   Same here. And lots of flickering.\r\n\r\nPreferences -> Displays -> Resolution: More Space (1680 x 1050)\r\n\r\nThere's a bit of flickering no matter the resolution, on the first 1-2 seconds, no matter the resolution. But it doesn't stabilize on \"More Space\". I'm guessing it's the same issue as #428  I've also got this problem. I found out that perhaps the bug is related to iTunes? When I got iTunes running in full screen in the background, and the small 'pop-up' which displays the number started playing appears, the screensaver works as supposed. (no top/bottom bars) However, this iTunes 'pop-up' only appears for like 3 seconds, after that the bars appear again. Having the same issue here. I can confirm this only happens on mac os >= 10.13. I just upgraded and didn't have the issue on 10.12. Same issue under 10.13.4\r\nworked like a charm under 10.13.3 before ...\r\n(MacBook Pro 13\") \ud83d\udc4d  Same issue under 10.13.4 with 15\" MBP, scaled display. Same here - after upgrading to 10.13.4  Same issue. \ud83d\ude22 Glad to hear I'm not alone.  +1 Same issue on 10.13.4\r\n![img_0015](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8902656/39135970-d0a5ef0c-46df-11e8-8e14-3a54a92f5a31.JPG)\r\n Same!  Also, I agree with @Bokdem - it seems to be related to iTunes, as I have a similar issue when playing video in iTunes.  The top and bottom 'bars' appearing on my MBP are not black; instead, they appear to be pieces of another video or picture being displayed 'underneath' Aerial. I believe this is related to multiple resolutions. I don't use iTunes at all. The problem only seems to crop up when the screensaver is used on multiple screen sizes. And I cannot reproduce if using multiple monitors that are the same size. @benjamincharity seems plausible! I cannot reproduce it with 2 monitors of the same size, but it does happen when all 3 (different sizes) are connected  Same here. Getting the issue on 10.13.4 on 13\" MacBook Pro with touch bar. Happens with one or two externally connected monitors (but only to the MacBook Pro screen - external monitors look good). > And I cannot reproduce if using multiple monitors that are the same size.\r\n\r\nPerhaps try rotating one of the displays 90deg. > Perhaps try rotating one of the displays 90deg.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately not an option for me since my monitors are not square.\r\n\r\nWork setup:\r\n\r\n| Left | Center | Right |\r\n|-----|-----|:---:|\r\n| 15\" MB | wide 3440x1440 | vertical 1080x1920 |\r\n\r\nHome setup:\r\n\r\n| Left | Center | Right |\r\n|-----|-----|:---:|\r\n| vertical 1080x1920 | wide 3440x1440 | vertical 1080x1920 | Getting stretch effect projecting my second screen (overflow, not duplicate) from Air 13 (Early 2015) to Epson 980w.\r\n\r\n10.13.14\r\nIntel HD Graphics 6000 1536 MB > Unfortunately not an option for me since my monitors are not square.\r\n\r\nNeither are mine (or very many displays for that matter) but I still get the issue on same-sized monitors with a different rotation... Same here. One of mine is rotated 90\u00b0 but I get the same issue (only on the Macbook itself) I have a 12\" MacBook and now a 2014 Late Mac Mini and both started putting black side bars on my widescreen monitor and cropping the video. 3440x1440. Tinkering around with it, checking Display Clock stopped the black bars for me and now looks normal with the clock on. This all started after the latest  10.13.3 and now 10.13.4 Mac OS updates.  Nice find @psmith3. Showing the clock did fix the display for my widescreen and laptop display. \r\n\r\nStill looks odd on the vertical display for me:\r\n\r\n![img_0259-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/270193/40016499-7fc89e9e-5784-11e8-9830-e40ed6dff6ee.jpg)\r\n\r\n Same problem that only begun a few days ago, external screen is fine, laptop on starts fine but quickly flashes and the bars appear while the video seems to be bottom aligned, tried removing everything to reinstall but no fix. Only thing that has updated recently was Xcode on the 14th Similar issue.  Recently started.  Current MacOS 10.13.4.\r\n\r\nI have two identical LG Ultra-wide monitors that are 2560x1080.  The primary monitor on my right displays the Aerial Screensaver full width (stretched or fill).  While the secondary monitor on my left displays with black bars on the left and right (un-stretched or normal).\r\n\r\nBoth monitors are setup the same for resolution \"Default for display\". I have tried \"Scaled\" as well.  Both display properly for everything else (tried other screensavers). This project is dead IMHO It seems you can workaround by checking \"Show with clock\", not a real fix but I don't have problems anymore I tried the \"Show with clock\" (mine was already on).  What it does is affect the one monitor that is showing as my primary monitor.  If enabled the primary screen shows full and the secondary chopped left and right (black bars on left and right).  When disabled I can watch as my primary, that was fine, switches from full screen to chopped.  I can see it happen and it is just chopping off the sides (in other words it is not a stretch issue).  When the screensaver kicks in it is fine for just a second (since it had just previously had the clock on) then it refreshes and chops off the sides.  The behavior did not exists a few MacOS versions back. Related to #452 - same fix (clock) Unfortunately, it is still a problem for me in 1.4.1. I am running with external monitor (1920x1200) as main display and laptop screen at 1280x800 equivalent. Main display alternates between full screen and black bars on top and bottom. Laptop screen always has black bars. High Sierra 10.13.6. - MacBook Pro 13, 2017, Touch Bar\r\n- 1080p H264 (tried playing HEVC, got high CPU usage on this machine)\r\n\r\nIn mirrored mode: what I described before: alternating on main display, letterboxed on laptop screen. Also noticed lag between screens (videos not synchronized)\r\nIn \"only main display\" mode: top/bottom flicker a few times, then settles on playing full screen\r\nIn \"different mode\": on both display top and bottom flickers, then plays full screen.\r\n\r\nI also tried unplugging the monitor and playing with laptop screen only. The screensaver froze and did not respond to keyboard. After I plugged the monitor back, it eventually crashed the whole session and kicked me to the login screen. That time I unplugged the monitor first. I tried it again and couldn't reproduce the freeze. With laptop screen only, there was brief garbage on the entire screen and then it plays okay full screen. as far as 'main' display, they may be referring to while under display preferences, the main display is whichever has the 'white bar' at the top. and you can drag that bar to other/external monitors. no problem!, just for reference, my main display(under sys prefs) in one of my two external monitors, both are using scaled settings(2560x1440) and with my MacBookPro open(3rd display, default resolution), I am not seeing any letterboxing on any of the displays. I have tried different settings on different displays and have not been able to reproduce the letterbox effect either. Possibly is the monitor being scaled to non-widescreen aspect ratio, which I would think would cause the letterboxing..? I'm on Mojave, 10.14.1 dev, and on a MacBook Pro 13\" w/ Touch Bar\r\n\r\n > * Are you running external non scaled, at 1920x1200, and  internal scaled at 1280x800 ? Or is external scaled too ?\r\n\r\nThat's correct. It's a little bit more complicates, since unlike your Air, the Pro display is retina. If I recall correctly, it used to be 2x of 1280x800 (2560x1600). In Sierra or so, they switched the default to look like 1440x900, which looks too small to me, so I keep it in the 1280x800 mode. I checked and the same issue happens in the default mode of the internal display.\r\n\r\n> Can you install (then quit System Preferences and launch again), go to the Aerial tab, enable debug mode AND log to disk, then close it, And launch the screensaver. If you see black bars or whatever, go to Aerial cache folder and attach the AerialLog.txt ?\r\n\r\nAttached are the screenshots and the log file. Let me know if I can do anything else to help you reproduce it.\r\n\r\n[AerialLog.txt](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/files/2489411/AerialLog.txt)\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-17 at 2 42 08 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/366750/47118445-1e0ebe00-d21c-11e8-8403-a9f3a9099831.png)\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-17 at 2 42 23 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/366750/47118447-1e0ebe00-d21c-11e8-8078-d078e2887d3f.png\">\r\n\r\n > One thing does come to mind : I may have a bug if the main screen is not retina and the 2nd is. Would it be a lot of trouble for you to switch temporarily the main screen to internal just to see ? I think the other way around may be fine (retina main, non retina external) but maybe not the other way around ?\r\n\r\nI switched main display to internal. After that video plays full-screen on internal screen (after a momentary glitch) and with black bars on the external.\r\n\r\n> Otherwise, very long shot but I did a quick build with retina detection disabled on main screen. Maybe that will help :\r\n> https://github.com/glouel/Aerial/releases/download/v1.4.2test3/Aerial.saver.zip\r\n\r\ntried it, no change\r\n FWIW The 1.4.1 fixed it for me once I completely deleted the existing version, restarted system preferences, and then installed Arial.\r\n\r\nMojave 10.14\r\nArial 1.4.1 test4 version didn't help, but I found some more information:\r\n- when there are black bars at the top and bottom, the video is also cropped horizontally. It's easy to see on the LA Airport video, where the left taxiway is off-screen.\r\n- In the \"separate\" mode, the videos have similar problems for a second and then go to correct view.\r\n- interestingly, the problem **goes away** when I set a non-zero fade duration and the video has been cached.\r\n\r\nI briefly looked at the code, and although I don't understand it completely, I think it may have something to do with \"readyForDisplay\" observer and shared views. Timing of the player creation (cached vs. online) might also play a role. Same thing in test4 and test6. Also, if the video is not cached it often just shows black screen.\r\nThese issues didn't happen in the versions before 1.4. But I am glad I found a workaround: having it cached + fade in. Thank you. I am still getting black screen often when streaming. But it's intermittent and might be caused by apple's servers. Seems to happen more on pre-tvOS12 videos. I gave up on streaming and cached the enabled videos, not that there is a nice GUI for it. The other unfortunate thing I noticed is that video looks a little jerky on external display. Not sure if it is related to scaling or sharing the video player. > > I gave up on streaming and cached the enabled videos, not that there is a nice GUI for it.\r\n\r\nMis-typed, should read as \"now that there is a nice GUI for it\"\r\n\r\n> That's weird. You're running external as main right ? Can you define \"jerky\" ? \r\n\r\nIt is hard to define. The motion doesn't look smooth, where things are moving fast, like waves in Hawaii. It look like judder from either skipped frames or mis-matched frame rate. It is subtle though. I don't see a difference in the 2 videos mode. \r\n  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS APP. It is beautiful and peaceful.\r\n\r\nI am a graduate assistant at a college and would love the option to use your app to point to a list of hosted aerial videos of our campus so that students could load your software but with our videos. Would that be an easy change to point the request to a different set of links? If you match the JSON returned from http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json to your dataset, you should be able to change it to wherever you want via https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Models/ManifestLoader.swift#L76 @clapperman I've built an app which evolved into a screen saver as well which might be helpful for that if you host your videos on YouTube, Vimeo or Wistia: https://github.com/pendowski/VSaver\r\nCheck it out and let me know if it works for you. Adding some other hosting services should be a big of a deal.\r\n  I installed the screen saver on my MacBook Pro 13\" w/touch bar runninng High Sierra 10.13.3.\r\n\r\nThe screensaver starts for 1 split second and then the entire screen shows a distorted image. \r\nI tried uninstalling and reinstalling.\r\n\r\nIt works on my friends computer.

Having the same issue, playback starts smooth then becomes choppy after a few minutes. Currently on Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.3 Ticking the Show Clock does not help the issue. Interestingly (not) but for me ticking the `Show Clock` really smoothens everything. Same experience here. \r\n\r\n1. Scaled display (1680x1050).\r\n2. With \"Show Clock\" option disabled, there are top and bottom bars of the video and the middle portion of the video is zoomed in.\r\n3. With \"Show Clock\" enabled, clock is the first thing to display and then the video appears as intended with no zoom or choppiness. I'm not sure if this is the same issue you have are experiencing but this is what mine looks like about 3 seconds after the screensaver is active.\r\n\r\nOS Version: Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.3\r\n\r\n![img_0919](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3204878/38831974-f16b92e0-41b8-11e8-8233-288cc1ffec05.JPG)\r\n No, I haven\u2019t seen this yet although this looks more GPU related.

Sorry Alistair!  Todo:\r\n- [x] Replaces existing resources with 4K SDR assets\r\n- [ ] Consider allowing user to select both 4K and HD assets\r\n- [x] Fix issue where cached download count is off by 1 (JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/350)\r\n- [x] Fix issue where video would be reused across multiple monitors even after enabling `Play Different Aerial On Each Display`. It is caused because the random video selection does not consider videos already in use. (JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/212)\r\n- [x] Fix issue where titles are cut off (JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/413) It looks like that, aside from a testing error, this is ready to merge. Is that correct? Noticed both this merge request and the 4k feature branch seem abandoned, and the issue discussing it has been locked (which I sort of get \u2013 that discussion was completely off the rails). I'm still supporting my feature branch / fork if anyone wants to contribute to it.  @esetnik Thanks for keeping up with it. What work still needs to be done? I'm happy to help. None as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019ve been using the 4K aerial for several months without issue. I think @JohnCoates needs to chime in if he wants to use his feature branch or this one for 4k support. When will a 4K version come to the iMac Pro? @scottws2000 is there an issue with my forked version on the iMac Pro? @esetnik how do I know if I have your forked version? also thank you for your time and help @scottws2000 you can test my release [here](https://github.com/esetnik/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.3).

Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.` that is a known bug with macOS that was reported to Apple in April 2016 as [rdar://25569037](http://openradar.appspot.com/25569037). As of November 2017 the bug is still not fixed. To work around the bug:\r\n* select the Aerial screensaver in System Preferences\r\n* close System Preferences with Aerial selected\r\n* reopen System Preferences and the preview should work now\r\n\r\n### Mac won't sleep with Aerial as screensaver\r\n\r\nIf your Mac won't sleep while Aerial is the selected screensaver, then you probably have an older version of Aerial installed. Download the latest verson of Aerial here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/ Make sure to check both locations for the old version, it can be installed to `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/User/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers`.\r\n\r\n### Corrupted playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting corrupted playback when the screensaver starts then that is a new bug in macOS High Sierra. It appears to be a problem with the Intel drivers in High Sierra. As a workaround tick the \"Show with clock\" option as that seems to eliminate the corruption for the moment. Discussed extensively here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/377\r\n\r\n### No playback\r\n\r\nIf you are getting a crossed out play icon instead of the preview or the videos just never seem to load, please check that a firewall or proxy isn't blocking the screensavers access to the videos. Trying the following two URLs in a web browser might show if they are blocked. If you are on a Macbook you can also try caching the videos on another network to test whether it is your network provider that is blocking access.\r\nhttp://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\nhttp://a1.v2.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/comp_GL_G004_C010_v03_6Mbps.mov\r\n > Download a good video in the Mainland, but also over the wall to run, I hope to be able to do some optimization, thanks\r\n\r\n??? > Yeah, I'm just going to close this. Not sure what its supposed to be about but given the userpic I'm going to assume spam. :D\r\n\r\nThis is not spam, you can really translate the title to English by using Google translate. This user probably used low quality Chinese - English translate software (probably Baidu) to translate into his/her words into English.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the title/issue: The video was downloaded in the Mainland China, but in order to run, the user need to use VPN. Hope can do better optimization.\r\n  Apple pushes us to keep up with Swift. Since Xcode 9.1 Swift 4 is the one to use. The changes were little, so it would be a good idea to merge this one. I did a build with Xcode Version 9.2 beta (9C34b) and the result is the same :( @klaas I'm keeping my fork at swift 3 for now \ud83d\ude22 . I guess we can keep this rebased and merge it in once Apple fixes Xcode 9. Good news! This compiled and works for me in macOS 10.13.3 (Xcode 9.2). But there's a fun UI bug:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-24 at 11 40 50 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/344926/35376460-2148163a-0160-11e8-9e62-a129e023bcb9.png\">\r\n\r\n(Oh. Nevermind? Looks like this is also in the 1.2 release.) I already fixed that UI bug in my fork as well, good to know we can now compile it with swift 4. @mckern did you really use Xcode 9.2 and macOS 10.13.3? \r\n\r\nI used the latest versions (Xcode 9.2 9C40b, macOS 10.13.3 17D2047) with my Klaas-Swift4 branch and sadly still get the same error when going to the saver preferences:\r\n\r\n`Error loading /Users/klaas/Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver/Contents/MacOS/Aerial:  dlopen(/Users/klaas/Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver/Contents/MacOS/Aerial, 265): can't resolve symbol _OBJC_CLASS_$_NSError in /Users/klaas/Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver/Contents/MacOS/../Frameworks/libswiftCore.dylib because dependent dylib #1 could not be loaded in /Users/klaas/Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver/Contents/MacOS/../Frameworks/libswiftCore.dylib`\r\n\r\nMaybe you did something that I didn't? Any hints welcome, I would really like to get the Swift 4 version working on my machine. Xcode 9.2 + Swift 3.2, also does not work for me. :( Did check again. I'm on macOS 10.13.4 (17E199) now and even the \"Aerial.saver\" that I compiled in January works now! :-) I did a clean build, updated the Xcode project settings for Xcode 9.3 and removed a little Swift 4.1 warning.\r\n\r\nTravis only supports \"Xcode9.3beta\" at the moment, but everything seems to work!\r\n\r\nNow we are good to go and continue developing in Swift 4.1 ?!\r\n\r\n @klaas I also verified this morning that my fork compiled with Xcode 9.3 runs on macOS 10.13.4.  Beautiful, ingenious and works very well \u2014 High Sierra 10.13.1.\r\nThe only wrinkle I've run into is that when Aerial is used, the \"Turn Display Off After\" in the Energy Saver panel doesn't step in and put the screen to sleep after the chosen time. \r\nThanks for your good work ...\r\nbradleyks Thanks much for your reply. And, yes, I was using v1.1 \u2014 v1.2 did the trick!  Is it possible for you to implement the new \uf8ff TV 4K Screensavers to Aerial? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/378  The screensaver is not playing at all.

Just the \"with this version of macOS\". And the suggested workaround in readme doesn't work.  I've been having this issue with my 2011 MacBook Pro. Maybe the screen saver isn't supported on the older hardware. But when I open System Preferences and go to Aerial, no preview that ever loads. I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times. When I open the the screen saver options I see the attached. This may be a duplicate issue and I do apologize if that is the case.

When all screensavers are unchecked and I press 'Download now', it still downloads all of the files and I end up with a folder of roughly 8GBs of movies. Why not just download those I selected and want to have as my screen saver?  Screensaver not working on latest macos version MACOS High Sierra @alistairmcmillan I am getting the following error message \"You cannot use Aerial Screen Saver with this version of macOS.

That fixed the issue. @alistairmcmillan  The workaround doesn't work for me...\r\nAny theory about the cause? @alistairmcmillan  That's right. @alistairmcmillan Good to know thanks\uff01  I have a MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, 2017) running MacOS 10.3.1 and Aerial 1.2 just downloaded from you page in GitHub.\r\n\r\nAerial starts normally and in seconds fills the screen with horizontal lines.\r\n\r\nPlease see video attached.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[IMG_1401 480.zip](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/files/1404871/IMG_1401.480.zip)\r\n\r\n Thank you very much for your answer with the workaround, it worked.\r\n\r\nI apologize for duplicating the issue.\r\n\r\nCongratulations for your software, best screensaver ever, very elegant, excellent implementation.  Hey John, \r\n\r\nI hope you're well. \r\nI just downloaded your aerials screensaver on my iMac 27\". \r\n\r\nIt's brill! Thanks so much for making it, I loved the screensavers on my Apple TV and now I can have them here too. \r\n\r\nThe only thing which I think could be better is if they were HD or 2K?\r\nMy screen is a 2K 27\" screen and so they look a bit low quality and could be sharper on here. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nAll the best, \r\nTom McCagherty Duplicate of #378.  Closing issue.  Haha, just kidding, I've always wanted to do that to someone. I cant close this issue, but someone will :)  Not sure if it's related to your screen saver, but i'm getting very odd flickering/juddering of the images\r\n\r\nSteps..\r\nScreen saver already installed working perfectly on Sierra\r\nUpgrade to High Sierra v10.13\r\nView the screen saver\r\nScreen flickering on all images\r\n\r\n Ah thanks... sorry I missed the original And when I have extended display with additional screens it works. When I'm just on my Mac, it does the flickering.   When night shift is on screensaver either distorts into bars or doesn't load. \r\nDisabling nightshift immediately fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nOtherwise a beautiful screensaver, wish it came as standard on Macs \ud83d\ude42 Issue not reproducible for me. It works with NightShift enabled and macOS 10.13.  Hi, this doesn't work with MacOS High Sierra. Hi @alistairmcmillan - yes, I'll give a little more context. As soon as I preview or 'hot corner' the screensaver, there's a glitch effect that appears after a second. I'm using a 2017 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch ID.   I install aerial by brew cask, and I had reinstall many time. I also download on GitHub to reinstall.\r\nBut it is not working on my MacBook Pro 15 2016. it was working on MacOS 10.12.\r\nAnd I had downloaded all the cache.And the video is play well on VLC.\r\nNow it just show nothing but black.\r\n![snip20171007_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9131383/31309062-c223b9a0-abb2-11e7-9f04-26319e8d15d2.png)\r\n\r\n![snip20171007_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9131383/31309135-ec4ed984-abb3-11e7-89ee-257f204e8a41.png)\r\n\r\n![snip20171007_6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9131383/31309157-57841e4e-abb4-11e7-8c78-d2b61307e3ed.png)\r\n\r\n![snip20171007_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9131383/31309123-c3175744-abb3-11e7-8741-9fa5e25c06c6.png)\r\n\r\nBTW aerial is an awesome tool. It's really funny,it doesn't work a few days, and I try anything I could to repair it but doesn't work... So I came here looking for help...And just when I finished commenting my issue I found areial is working...I just don't know why...I just do nothing...funny... OK,thank you so much. I will check that.  Whenevver it is supposed to show the aerial video, the graphic is not working and shows noisy lines (appears like the sitaution that graphic card is broken). Not matter auto triggerd or preview. There are couple of possibilities:\r\n- My mac does have graphic issue (low possiblities because the condition only appears in the above case only, nothing wrong in other daily use)\r\n- The software has graphic issue, either macOS or this library\r\n\r\nThe picture shows my mac information.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-06 at 16 29 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7512999/31297450-0547e5da-aab4-11e7-8e66-91e80464171b.jpg)\r\n  For some reason the video either plays with a ton of stutter or it does this weird interlace appearing thing. Here is a video:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/nJl3MXMr4Ho\r\n\r\nI am on a MacBook Pro 2017 15\" OSX High Sierra  Hi,\r\n\r\nEver since upgrading my software to High Sierra when the screen savers comes up there is a distorion on my screen like its an old school tv.\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to delete the screen saver and add it again when its compatible with High Sierra Okay thank you for the quick reply  Been using, love it, but on new MacBook pro 13, once video launches I get diagonal lines\r\n![img_0453](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32499237/31151357-f3a57744-a84b-11e7-82a2-80b72928e373.JPG)\r\n\r\n![img_0453](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32499237/31151315-cd2810a4-a84b-11e7-8968-2a17c9f0e929.JPG)\r\n  It crashes with High Sierra, Thanks Here with the same issue. Happens on my 2017 iMac and my 2012 rMBP. Aerial ran fine on Sierra but crashes on High Sierra. There's no error message and no graphic glitch. When the screensaver starts (naturally on the timer or forced by hot corners) the screen goes black and then kicks back to the desktop after 2-3 seconds.\r\n\r\nIf the security preferences are set to lock the computer immediately after a screensaver begins, then instead of kicking the user back to the desktop they're presented with the unlock screen. Latest version installed, all videos cached. Unfortunately, that didn't fix it on the iMac. I can try it out on the MBP tonight. Just tried deleting the cached videos too, for good measure. Still the same crashing problem though. Hmmm. Ok, currently I am behind a firewall. I'll test it from a clean connection as soon as I'm able.\r\n\r\nWhy would this start happening after the upgrade to High Sierra though? Could that just be a coincidence? Worth noting - hitting \"Preview\" in the screensaver page in System Settings loads Aerial just fine. It's only when called through hot corners or timing that the crash occurs. I had the same issue (on multiple computers). Initially thought it was a LittleSnitch issue, but I was able to resolve the issue by re-caching the video files.  Same problem that it crashes on High Sierra here.\r\nA workaround that seems to work for me is to tick the \"show with clock\" box. Only downside is that you'll have a clock on the screensaver... Same thing happened here, redownloaded the latest issues and recaching all the videos. Remydb's solution works, show with clock works  I have the graphical glitch, even after deleting and re-downloading. Show with clock resolves it, but has the clock. In High Sierra. I have the issue on my work 2017 MBP 15\" but it's fine on my 2016 MBP 13\" with TouchBar. Both with High Sierra. Could be a GPU issue? My 13\" MBP doesn't have a discrete GPU, the 15s do.\r\nShow with clock also resolves, but it's ugly.\r\n\r\nPreviewing the screen saver also glitches on my 15\" unless I have the clock enabled.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** Looks like it is a GPU issue as disabling *Automatic graphics switching* (in Energy system prefs panel) fixes the issue.  After trying to uninstall, reinstall, delete from Library, etc. I found that disabling the Automatic graphics switching (Energy prefs) fixes the issue.  I am using a 2016 MacBook Pro 15\" with TouchBar with the Intel HD Graphics 530 chipset and running MacOS High Sierra.  Hey! I love Aerial, but the live images are not working on my 2017 MacBook Air. They freeze. I think its a problem of hardware that doesn't support high images like this. I don't now what to do :(  I got myself a MBP just last weekend, upgraded to High Sierra and installed the aerial screensaver that works perfectly on my 2010 iMac and 2015 MBA. On the MBP, I see the image flash and then the screen is filled with cross line (resembling static). The MBP has no graphic auto switching have installed v1.2 as suggested above but can't seem to get the screensaver working. Any advice? The preview window (not the preview itself) seems to show the moving images well. :( Having the same issue with MBA 2017. Just screen scramble...sometimes it works, but it's random and intermittent.  High Sierra does not think this is compatible. Additionally, I'm seeing stuttering of the screen saver on startup. Thanks for the quick response!  First of all - \r\n\r\nI LOVE your work with this, I was only curious if you were planning on updating to support 4K content now they all the screensavers have been updated with the release of the 4K Apple TV?  This is already discussed heavily in #378   Hey I really love the app. Unfortunately, today I installed High Sierra and when the videos start then it just glitches out. It also happens when preview in the preferences section.   Everyone at my office loves aerial, but we're having trouble identifying the locations.  Is there a key / easter egg that will reveal the place name on the screen while it's running? from pull #285 @kevinawoo made a forked release for those that can't or are too lazy to compile https://github.com/kevinawoo/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3-location-lables/Aerial.v1.3-location-labels.zip\r\n\r\nadditionally my mac desktop background program uses the aerial saver with location label enabled,\r\nhttps://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/Aerial_Desktop\r\n\r\n\r\n great job @kevinawoo! just installed your fork. i'd also like to suggest including the day in the label. for those that like to only see the \"good\" ones, that helps better isolate which aerials to remove from the rotation.  #285 @ohayon originally created this functionality. @byalextran, consider posting that feedback in his pull request.  After upgrading to MacOS High Sierra (10.13) I have noticed the video in Aerials, on occasion, has graphical artifacts which appear at varying levels of severity. On my MacBook Pro I have seen the screen flicker and go completely blank. Hoping that the screen saver gets updated for High Sierra, it's just an awesome screen saver.  the 4k versions are soon to be out, would love to have added those.  Any plans to update this to pull the 4k resolution screen savers from the new AppleTV 4k??  The screen saver doesn't work on my Mac Pro Late 2013 after I upgraded to macOS High Sierra 10.13.0.\r\n\r\nThe screensaver shows a black screen and the words \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS.  Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\" floating on the screen.\r\n\r\nOn my 2017 MBP Touchbar, when the screen saver plays there are graphical glitches when going full screen, while on the Intel HD video card, but when forcing the mac to discreet graphics it works. I found that the screen saver does run if you enable the clock option in the screen saver options It's so stupid, damn Apple ) Thx for your advice with closing **System Preference** and selected **Aerial** screensaver - it works!   As I'm using and loving Aerial on the 5K iMac. the FHD video quality is really lacking compared to the new 4K Apple TV offers. It's a huge difference now, since I can actually see both version in real time. Is it possible to upgrade the videos to 4K standards?  I have Aerial running successfully on an iMac and a MBP 2015. However, it is not working on the new MBP with TouchBar. Do you intend to make this compatible with High Sierra. I love this app and am spoiled!  Run ArielApp in Instruments (or run leaks on ScreenSaverEngine).\r\n\r\nSimple fix attached.\r\n[diffs.txt](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/files/1318707/diffs.txt)\r\n  hello\r\nI have an 2017 Macbook pro 15 and I have install the Aerial.\r\nI just want to report that it's not working - I can't preview the screen saver and it's not loading \r\n\r\nis there any fix ? I have the same issue. It doesn't seem to work on High Sierra - I'm on GM build.\r\n\r\nWhen screensaver should initiate there is a scary flicker. Have attached the image for the same.\r\n\r\n![img_7484](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1756637/30630729-67ffb156-9dff-11e7-88a7-59001cd76624.JPG)\r\n  hi,\r\n\r\nin the config are only \"uncheck all\" and \"check all\".\r\n\r\nI need \"check all day videos\" and \"check all night videos\".\r\n\r\nthat would be great :)\r\n\r\nthanks for the nice prog! +1 \ud83d\udc4d  @alistairmcmillan:\r\n\r\nNo, #11 is auto at local time.\r\n\r\nI want manual select the day/night videos!\r\n\r\nbut the project looks dead here. :(  Looks like we'll finally get high resolution videos as part of the Apple TV 4K.\r\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2017/09/11/tvos-11-4k-apple-tv-screensaver/\r\n\r\nCan't wait to get them on my iMac  I wonder if anyone has found/published the new URL(s) to these yet? Great question. I'm looking for the links for the 4K videos, too. The race is on! I'm looking as well. Seems like they've obfuscated the URLs in tvOS 11 That just means it's over SSL. Just need to do a MITM attack on a demo ATV and should be clear as day @AddoSolutions  Haha, \"Just\". Apple tends to use SSL pinning. Hopefully they didn't in this case, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that route. Yeah, I was thinking about that in the shower. On the normal device, you\r\ncan add a SSL authority, and just do it that way. However, in this case, it\r\nmay be more complicated because I don't think you can do that on Apple TV\r\n Even on regular iOS devices, Apple uses SSL pinning so that even root certs won't fool their critical services. Try opening the App Store on macOS or iOS while running your MITM proxy. You need to disable pinning with https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2 for example Can't you find the screensavers in the IPSW file? I can't check as I'm not a developer. That's what 9to5Mac said though (at least for the screensaver they put on YouTube) The IPSW has a file called Default.mov in the screensaver app that I was able to find. This is probably what 9to5Mac found as well, but it does not include all of the videos, just that one demo. The rest of the videos probably still get streamed from web locations like with tvOS 10.\r\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t able to find any URLs in the IPSW that look like they point to a manifest file, but this is my first time looking through an IPSW and I\u2019m not sure how to extract absolutely everything.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else can find it? \r\n\r\n Good news! I got the URLs. It wasn't in the IPSW, and the URL was transmitted using SSL pinning. Very hard to get.\r\nThese 4k videos are really beautiful. Now I just need to figure out how I'm going to play them. Any chance you can share the URL(s)? :) I'd be curious, too! Yeah! Thats a total tease :) Me three! :)\r\n\r\nWondering how you found them as well! \r\n\r\nMichael Sheaver\r\n703-200-3008\r\nmsheaver@me.com\r\nwww.michaelsheaver.com Sounds like he used this https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2 C'mon, you are killing me! Please add the new 4K screensavers. They're amazing. I'll post the URL here as soon as I release support for 4K. They're using HEVC which doesn't come with system support until High Sierra, so it's taking me a little longer.\r\n\r\nAs for how I found it: It was very hard, took me a long time to figure out, and requires a long explanation. To put it as simple as I can, I had to put my Apple TV running tvOS 11 through a proxy, but since I couldn't use SSL Kill Switch a lot of the connections were hidden. I had to correlate the request for the videos to the request for the sources URL, then since I couldn't see into that request I had to replicate it on the tvOS simulator, where I used a version of SSL Kill Switch that I modified to support this operation. The right modifications were found by using IDA Pro with Hex-Rays to reverse the simulator binaries resposible for checking the trust chain. Then I forged a request as if it came from the new 4K Apple TV.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or want more details feel free to DM me https://twitter.com/johncoatesdev https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/entries.json any idea how to play them?\r\n```\r\n===================== Video =====================\r\nId                          : 1\r\nFormat                      : HEVC\r\nFormat info                 : High Efficiency Video Coding\r\nFormatprofile               : Main 10@L5@High\r\nCodec Id                    : dvh1\r\nDuration (ms)               : 3mn 41s\r\nBit rate                    : 8 297 Kbps\r\nWidth                       : 3 840 pixels\r\nHeight                      : 2 160 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio        : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode             : Constant\r\nFrame rate                  : 29.970 (30000/1001) fps\r\nColor space                 : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling          : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                   : 10 bits\r\nCompression mode            : Lossy\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.033\r\nStream size                 : 219 MB (100%)\r\nTitle                       : Core Media Video\r\nEncoded date                : UTC 2017-07-23 19:18:01\r\nTagged date                 : UTC 2017-07-23 19:18:02\r\nColor range                 : Limited\r\nColor primaries             : BT.2020\r\nTransfer characteristics    : SMPTE ST 2084\r\nMatrix coefficients         : BT.2020 non-constant\r\nMastering display color pri : R: x=0.680000 y=0.320000, G: x=0.265000 y=0.690000, B: x=0.150000 y=0.060000, White point: x=0.312700 y=0.329000\r\nMastering display luminance : min: 0.0050 cd/m2, max: 4000.0000 cd/m2\r\nMaximum Content Light Level : 10000 cd/m2\r\nMaximum Frame-Average Light : 111 cd/m2\r\n``` @alistairmcmillan tried VLC but won't show anything, Potplayer just displays artifacts. @SuperDOS even Safari/QuickTime player fail to open them on High Sierra. VLC displays just a few colored blocks. Haven't tried https://nightlies.videolan.org/build/macosx-intel/ yet There's no way to play the HDR files currently. I opened up an issue with VLC, https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/18813\r\n\r\nI'll be adding support for the SDR files by using VLC Yeah, I am able to open the SDR files just fine in VLC.  Will be interesting to see how that affects performance (if my CPU is gonna be at 100% from this on my 2x 4k monitors :P I have 2x 1070s but I kind of doubt VLC is GPU accelerated. Great point on CPU usage. I'm contemplating supporting conversion to h264, but it takes a really long time to convert each video So, weird thought, but is anyone using High Sierra? You'd think that apple would add support for the HDR videos (considering iPhones are HDR, and shoot HDR video, etc.) I would have to imagine that QuickTime has been updated to support it?? You'd think so, but I'm on the High Sierra Public GM and the HDR versions won't work with QuickTime or VLC. The SDR 4k ones are fine. On my 4 core / 8 thread i7, VLC stutters and is almost unusable with the 4k SDR, QuickTime is around 20% CPU and is fine. Thanks for the heads up @microbug. I'll definitely add in conversion as an option, and default to Quicktime if on High Sierra. Just release a 2.0 that only supports high sierra and up, the others can use the old one \ud83d\udc4d  IMHO. No need to clutter the code, just use Apples APIs to play the videos, they will def be most optimized of them all. Uploaded the SDR versions to Youtube (doesn't support HDR) and let them do the conversion :) . downloaded the converted MP4 version and it runs much smoother in VLC without HW decoding. I believe HDR video makes sense only if the display supports HDR. Software cannot compensate for the lack of HDR support in the display right? Also will 4K be useful if screensaver is being rendered on a 1080p display? \r\nEither ways, hope there will be an option to pick one of the 4 options Apple appears to provide(1080p SDR/1080p HDR/4K SDR/4K HDR). Do let me know if this needs to be put as a separate Enhancement request. Indeed, most displays (including the built-in displays on all current iDevice and Mac products IIRC) don't support HDR so there's no point in using the HDR videos on them. The 4k screensaver might be crisper on a 1080p display than the original 1080p one, it depends how heavily the original was compressed. Someone could do a comparison between the two? Regardless, you'd probably want 1080p on a 1080p display when away from power as downscaling 4k will drain battery faster than playing 1080p. @SuperDOS I wouldn't be that keen on using videos that have gone through YouTube. Their heavy compression turns nice videos to garbage. I'd be happy to do some higher-quality transcodes to x264 if needed, I have a spare machine to do it on. The recent iMac (last 2015) screens have wide-colour-gamut displays (DCI P3). I think this is part of what is improved in HDR.\r\nPresumably an HDR video would look better on a wide-colour-gamut display than an SDR video would? I think transcoding and re-hosting videos breaks the law, there must be a way to use the existing files. @microbug I though so as well but was quite suprised how the converted 4k versions turned out from youtube. I use this videos as screen saver for kodi on my 4k philips and looks great.\r\n\r\n```\r\n===================== Video =====================\r\nId                          : 1\r\nFormat                      : AVC\r\nFormat info                 : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormatprofile               : High@L5.1\r\nFormatsettings, CABAC       : No\r\nFormatsettings, ReFrames    : 2 frames\r\nCodec Id                    : avc1\r\nCodec info                  : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration (ms)               : 8mn 0s\r\nBit rate                    : 10.9 Mbps\r\nWidth                       : 3 840 pixels\r\nHeight                      : 2 160 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio        : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode             : Constant\r\nFrame rate                  : 29.970 (30000/1001) fps\r\nColor space                 : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling          : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\r\nScan type                   : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.044\r\nStream size                 : 624 MB (100%)\r\nEncoded date                : UTC 2017-09-19 06:35:07\r\nTagged date                 : UTC 2017-09-19 06:35:07\r\nColor range                 : Limited\r\nColor primaries             : BT.709\r\nTransfer characteristics    : BT.709\r\nMatrix coefficients         : BT.709\r\n\r\n``` As @spitfire said, re-hosting the videos is likely going to violate the law in many jurisdictions; I know it will in the United States. All transcoding, if that is the route that is chosen, will have to be done on local hardware.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think you should support 4K/HDR on High Sierra only, using Apple's built-in playback support. Hardware decoding is an absolute requirement when you start getting to 4K and higher resolutions. All of this talk about transcoding videos is making this way more complicated than it needs to be. I've been trying to look into @peterrussell's theory that HDR encoded video will look better on the WCG (P3) displays in the iMac and MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\n[This overview of HDR](http://4k.com/high-dynamic-range-4k-tvs-everything-need-know-hdr-contrast-wide-color-gamut-tvs-content-offer/) states:\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, in HDR TV standards, a given television has to also manage what\u2019s called P3 color, or at least 90% of it. P3 refers to the P3 part of the total color spectrum, which is quite a bit larger than the older Rec.709 color spectrum used in previous 4K TV models.\r\n> \r\n> All of the above amounts to what is also called the \u201cWide Color Gamut\u201d ideal among 4K TV makers, which means wider coverage of color spectrum and much smoother gradation between all possible shades in that covered spectrum space. It\u2019s an extended part of developing highly realistic display quality and high quality HDR.\r\n\r\nAlso, [this CNET article](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-is-wide-color-gamut-wcg/) says:\r\n\r\n> As I mentioned before, HDR and WCG often appear together, so most HDR material is also in WCG. Almost all 4K Blu-ray discs have wide color gamut. The same goes for HDR streams from places like Nextflix, Amazon and Vudu. To get an idea where you can get WCG content, check out [Where can I get HDR TV shows and movies?](https://www.cnet.com/news/where-can-i-get-hdr-shows-and-movies-for-my-new-hdr-tv/)\r\n\r\nSo... I think that means yes? I'm still not sure.\r\n\r\n**Follow up question:** does anyone know if you hook up a [LG 32UD99-W](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1312886-REG/lg_32ud99_w_32_16_9_hdr10.html), will it fully display HDR encoded video?\r\n\r\nI recently purchased a [TCL 55P607](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y6FSV5Q/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAMEeAAAAAGgu67sAAAAAWEgeAg) specifically because [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-4k-tv-on-a-budget/) said it was the best HDR display you can get for under a grand. Will my 2016 MacBook Pro be capable of sending it the same HDR content the new Apple TV can? @huebs IIRC, true HDR requires 10+ bits per channel. Anything less and you just spread the finite colors across the wider gamut. If your display supports both 30-bit color and a wide gamut, then it should benefit at least somewhat from HDR videos. For those who are wondering, we are able to play \"url-4K-HDR\" video files found [here](https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/entries.json) with QuickTime in High Sierra by changing the fourCC (video codec identifier) dvh1 to hvc1.\r\n\r\n`vi -b -c \"%s/dvh1/hvc1/g\" -c \"wq\" /path/to/video/file` # Quality and comparison screenshots\r\n> For those who don't want to download pretty ugly (and quite big) HDR videos.\r\n\r\nSo here's a 2 comparison full screen screenshots between the (almost) same frame on both HDR and SDR video. Both files read by QuickTime on macOS High Sierra, HDR file *converted* using @maiwennleclercq's technique.\r\n\r\n> These are JPGs at maximum quality just to reduce file size to upload on GitHub, they were not modified and come straight from the screen capture PNG file\r\n\r\n> **The screenshots actually look like the video in QuickTime**\r\n\r\n## SDR\r\n![dub_aerial_4k_sdr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4186230/31006749-5383ffc4-a4fe-11e7-8dbf-8ada72d3b09e.jpg)\r\n\r\n## HDR\r\n![dub_aerial_4k_hdr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4186230/31006752-58059594-a4fe-11e7-906d-b35771b237ac.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Comprehensive review\r\nViewed on the latest 2017 15\" MacBook Pro, it seems like the HDR video is looking like an ungraded video. It mainly lacks contrast & saturation, in a very noticeable way. Whereas the SDR file just looks gorgeous and richer.\r\n\r\nThis might be due to the fact that QuickTime does not read the HDR file properly. The fact you have to change from `dhv1` to `hvc1` might be the reason the file doesn't get read properly, especially regarding contrast data, I'm not sure. It might as well be the fact the display is not HDR, not sure either.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n\r\nHDR file won't get you any better image than SDR. On the contrary, as long as we do not have a proper way of playing HDR files, they will look ugly on your Mac.\r\n\r\nDownload the SDR. @habovh Thank you for pointing that out. @habovh @maiwennleclercq probably some decoder issue, hope that changes in the future, but for now SDR looks better.. @maiwennleclercq thanks for the technique to play HDR\r\n@habovh I appreciate the screenshot comparison\r\n\r\nJust wanted to give everyone a heads up. I'm currently working on the update. Sorry it's taking longer than it should, work has kept me very busy. I'm updating from Swift 3 -> Swift 4 and cleaning up the codebase. A great designer has reached out and is working with me to give Aerial a bit of a facelift also. More details soon.\r\n\r\n That\u2019s sounds great @johncoates. Patiently waiting for the update! Thanks for the findings. I've downloaded one of these 4K HDR from the `entries.json` file to feed it to my LG OLED C7, which [can](http://www.lg.com/uk/support/product-help/CT00008334-1435836452324-others) play some of the 4K HDR I've thrown at it, but I believe they need to be in a `mp4`/`mkv` container (and HEVC 4096x2160@60P MP@L5.1, Main10 Profile@L5.1 50Mbps). If there is a video format magician here who could give me a hint as to how best convert from one container to another without losing too much quality, I'd be grateful (neither VLC or Handbrake did help). Thanks. My AppleTV 4K arrived today. First thing I did was fire up Aerial and... it's gorgeous.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my last post, I've got a [TCL 55P607](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y6FSV5Q/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AgEAAAAAAAAAAMEeAAAAAGgu67sAAAAAWEgeAg). It supports HDR and Dolby Vision. When I plugged in the Apple TV, it defaulted to 4K HDR. It then offered to try switching to Dolby Vision and then asked me to confirm it was working.\r\n\r\nIn the Video Fomats menu, it lists:\r\n\r\n  * 4K Dolby Vision 60Hz\r\n  * 4K HDR 60Hz\r\n  * 4K SDR 60Hz\r\n  * 1080p Dolby Vision 60Hz\r\n  * 1080p HDR 60Hz\r\n  * 1080p SDR 60Hz\r\n  \r\nThen there's an option for \"Other Formats\", where I find:\r\n\r\n  * 4K Dolby Vision 50Hz\r\n  * 4K HDR 50Hz\r\n  * 4K SDR 50Hz\r\n  * 4K Dolby Vision 30Hz\r\n  * 4K HDR 30Hz\r\n  * 4K SDR 30Hz\r\n  * 4K Dolby Vision 25Hz\r\n  * 4K HDR 25Hz\r\n  * 4K SDR 25Hz\r\n  * 4K Dolby Vision 24Hz\r\n  * 4K HDR 24Hz\r\n  * 4K SDR 24Hz\r\n  * 1080p Dolby Vision 50Hz\r\n  * 1080p HDR 50Hz\r\n  * 1080p SDR 50Hz\r\n  * ...and a handful of sub-1080p SDR 60Hz\r\n  \r\nIf I plug in my 2016 15\" MacBook Pro with the Radeon Pro 460 4GB graphics card, I'm presented with this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screenshot 2017-10-02 17 00 08\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1166532/31104745-95236284-a793-11e7-989f-9a5acee364fb.png\">\r\n\r\nUnless I'm missing something, it looks like there's there currently no way to drive an HDR display using a 2016 MacBook Pro.\r\n\r\nNote that I tried using both a [USB-C to HDMI adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X4S5C7G/) hooked up with the same HDMI cable I used for the Apple TV and a [USB-C to HDMI cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYS3Q5A/).\r\n\r\nThe cable explicitly says it's only capable of 4K @ 30Hz. The adapter says it supports 4K @ 60Hz and has been, \"updated to support 2017 MacBook Pro & iMac with Thunderbolt 3.\"  Has anyone with either of those newer models tried hooking it up to a 4K HDR display?\r\n\r\nMy next step is to try [this 4K @ 60Hz cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07356QRZP/) and see if that gets the OS to present different resolution options. A helpful hint for anyone trying the above: to get my MBP to display an image on the 4K TV, I had to manually disable automatic graphics switching **before** plugging in either the cable or adapter. @sebastienbarre The LG C7 will actually play the .mov files natively, once you patch the dvh1 codec identifier back to hevc.\r\n\r\nThat said, using the latest ffmpeg snapshot build you can remux the Quicktime MPEG-4 into an ISO standard .mp4 and patch the codec identifier in one go with `ffmpeg -i input.mov -f hevc -vcodec copy output.mp4` @benwiggins thanks for the tip.

Works great, looks beautiful on the C7. Now to find a way to override the default screensaver... Does the new Apple TV display only these 9~10 HDR videos meintioned in the JSON feed? The last one had more than 20 videos.  That's pretty much off-topic @sabaatworld, the issue already has a lot of comments, let's try to only post useful information related to Aerial and its 4K support. There are plenty of other places on the internet for your question (to which I don't know the answer) \ud83d\ude0c **SDR 4K Versions**\r\nhttps://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D011_C009_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LA_A006_C008_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LW_L001_C006_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D008_C010_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LA_A009_C009_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/HK_B005_C011_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D001_C001_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LA_A005_C009_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D001_C005_4K_SDR_HEVC.mov\r\n\r\n**HDR 4K Versions**\r\n_Won't open in QuickTime on High Sierra_\r\nhttps://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D011_C009_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LA_A006_C008_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LW_L001_C006_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D008_C010_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LA_A009_C009_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/HK_B005_C011_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D001_C001_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/LA_A005_C009_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/Videos/DB_D001_C005_4K_HDR_HEVC.mov Is there anything I can help with on this? Maybe we can get a V2 Beta 1 released that simply uses the new JSON url and downloads the SDR versions, when on High Sierra? Refactoring to a new version of swift, and updating the UI seems like something to do in another issue/feature.  As aforementioned, this \"feature\" is already getting bloated enough :)\r\n\r\nIn my personal case, I see the Arial UI twice, once when I install it and the second when I check the box in screensavers that says \"Arial\".  I may be speaking for myself, but I would much rather just use the SDR versions for my High Sierra box, just as it is.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Models/ManifestLoader.swift#L76\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet apiURL = \"http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\"\r\nif #available(OSX 10.13, *) {\r\n         apiURL = \"https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/entries.json\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen here:\r\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Aerial/Source/Models/ManifestLoader.swift#L105\r\n\r\nMove the guts of the loop into a separate method, check if \"batches\" is an array or object.  If it's an array (aka the old screensavers) loop.  If not, then go straight to the method.\r\n\r\n(Note I am not a Swift dev, but just spitballing)\r\n\r\nThoughts? Running with the suggestion by @AddoSolutions I hacked together a quick 4k demo. You can live in the future now at https://github.com/esetnik/Aerial/tree/feature/4k.\r\n\r\nWarning this is completely experimental at this point. \ud83d\udc4d  @esetnik Would this slow older Macs down? Yeah I think 4K cpu decoding on macs without decent integrated graphics will cause high cpu usage and battery consumption. I think eventually it\u2019d be nice for Aerial to offer 4K video as an option in settings. @esetnik I think it would be much more useful allowing the user to convert the videos into 2K and then selecting them, no? @esetnik I compiled your branch, but I get the dreaded issue from #4 and can't enable 4k. Did you do anything specific to get it to work on 10.13.1? I have the same problem but it seems worse than #4 because the close and reopen solution doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s possible that we can\u2019t compile with Xcode 9 \ud83d\ude41 (I'm on Xcode 9.1, I might add) Didn't work for me either. Thanks for the suggestion @alistairmcmillan. I\u2019ve activated issues tab on my fork. Happy to accept a PR for fixing the swift 4 bundling. I have limited experience building a screensaver so any help on that front is appreciated. > @esetnik Your fork is Swift 3 code but bundling the Swift 4 libraries. Hence the error message.\r\n\r\n@alistairmcmillan can you comment on https://github.com/esetnik/Aerial/issues/1 regarding the correct procedure for bundling swift 3 libraries? I compiled a release of my branch with Xcode 8. If you just want 4k screensavers now you can download it [here](https://github.com/esetnik/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3/Aerial.saver.zip) @esetnik Thanks for this. I've now installed it.\r\nHowever, I'm looking at cached mov files' details and it seems that all of them are 1080p. Is it supposed to be like that or I'm missing something? Thanks. @UniverseXXX please direct all issues with my fork to https://github.com/esetnik/Aerial/issues. I want to avoid polluting the original thread.\r\n\r\nI am unable to reproduce the issue of cached videos only 1080p. I have updated my release with more detailed logging information.

[MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/MediaInfo) and at the same time of Dolby Vision stuff, FYI we jut have implemented Dolby Vision support in MediaInfo, with detection and display of version/profie/layers, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDolby Vision                             : 1.0, dvhe.stn@fhd30, BL+RPU\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the [Windows GUI snapshot](https://mediaarea.net/download/snapshots/binary/mediainfo-gui/20171201/MediaInfo_GUI_17.10.20171201_Windows.exe) (updates/other OSes [here](https://mediaarea.net/download/snapshots/binary/mediainfo-gui/) (mini 20171201)).\r\n Just an update, I've been running the 4K build on macOS high sierra beta since it was posted here, and it's been great, no issues at all! \ud83c\udf89 https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/378#issuecomment-346098838 @spitfire - hey, was looking at your JSON feed per comment https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/378#issuecomment-329960804 - it doesn't validate properly.\r\n\r\nEach line containing `\"accessibilityLabel\": ` has a trailing `,` character which should be dropped.\r\nTested with https://jsonlint.com/ @carlashley it\u2019s actually a bug in Apple\u2019s feed \ud83e\udd23. We should file a radar haha. D\u2019oh! facepalm.png I completely glossed over the Apple-ness of the URL! Sorry @spitfire!\n\nDefinitely file a RADAR. Have done it for GarageBand loops feed and it has been corrected in the past.\nTho maybe Apple might decide to make it harder to find the videos \ud83d\ude09 Yeah let\u2019s not let them know we\u2019ve found it just yet. Although it\u2019s not valid JSON it still does parse so it doesn\u2019t pose a real technical challenge. I installed @esetnik's fork over Thanksgiving and it looks great. Since I've been back in my office this week and plugged into my external monitors, it had my CPU and GPU running at 50% load on my 2016 MBP. It also was dropping frames like crazy. I think the 2017 models have better/native support for decoding HEVC. If you regularly use multiple monitors, I'd avoid 4K for now. I\u2019m getting a lot of reports related to 4K video playback but it\u2019s odd because the discrete GPU in the 2016 MBP should be capable of decoding HEVC. Can you confirm that playing the cached videos directly in QuickTime also causes performance issues? Do you also have stuttering playback / high cpu usage  4K@60 HEVC video playback in Photos app? I\u2019m trying to figure out if this is a screensaver exclusive issue or extends to other system apps. @esetnik - my problem was trying to parse it in python with `requests` (firstly), then with the standard `json` library :>\r\n\r\nTotally agree - definitely don't want to alert Apple to the fact we're onto it. \ud83d\udcaf  @esetnik I'll open an issue on your fork and go into more detail there. @esetnik I was having playback issues with 4K at first, but after I cached all the videos, playback has been smooth. (Late 2016 MBP)\r\nNo shutter in QT. @esetnik \r\n\r\nThank you very much. The 4k videos are a delight!\r\nStrangely, the issue I had earlier on my mbp 13' (with the workaround of having to enable the clock) is no longer seen!\r\n\r\nI see that there are 15 videos now. Any estimate of when we might be treated to the rest of the videos?!! Thanks in advance. \r\nCheers mate! @hssuhas I\u2019m glad you like it! Unfortunately Apple only shipped the limited set of 4K videos so that\u2019s all we have for now. Maybe they will release more in the future. HDR videos look crap on an IPad Pro 10.5\"\r\n![bb19761d-3d83-4d9a-a2f1-b335692bb19a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/505748/34184262-0f1b56be-e51f-11e7-9803-fdce2e25e114.png)\r\n![5f650c7e-c0c8-4ca5-a820-eb0547400ded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/505748/34184264-0f3c266e-e51f-11e7-9199-7c651fd370d1.jpeg)\r\n @esetnik \r\n> 2016 MBP should be capable of decoding HEVC\r\n\r\nHigh Sierra for now only supports HEVC via Intel.

There's no full HDR HEVC support in skylake Intel period. h265 main10 (the profile used in those videos) is only partially accelerated, just like VP9 was only partially accelerated (and pretty badly at that)\r\nOnly kabylake added full hardware VP9 and h265 main10\r\n\r\nCheck the Intel slide on the anandtech skylake presentation.\r\nhttps://www.anandtech.com/show/9562/intels-skylake-gpu-analyzing-the-media-capabilities.\r\n\r\n> HEVC_VLD_Main10 has a DXVA profile, but it is done partially in the GPU (as specified in the slide above)\r\n\r\nFor a thorough presentation of performance of skylake VS kabylake https://youtu.be/cI-a4WZWwZc\r\n\r\nA quick search of the difference between skylake and kabylake for hevc vp9 HDR will yield 100s of comparison \r\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-kaby-lake-s-hdr/\r\nhttp://www.fudzilla.com/news/graphics/40959-kaby-lake-gpu-learns-hardware-hdr\r\n\r\nHEVC hdr on a macbook pro 2016 will play poorly. Including on late 2016 MBP.\r\nTry the 2017 MBP, with the 8th gen Intel, it's night and day\r\n\r\n\r\n @jyavenard You are looking at the wrong place mate.\r\n\r\nIt uses the Radeon Pro for HEVC hardware accelerated decoding.\r\n\r\n@mattvlasach I also have the 2016 MacBook Pro with Radeon Pro 460. What type of 4K media were you using and does the player you use have Hardware Acceleration support? @jyavenard \r\n\r\n\u201cmacOS High Sierra adds support for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), with hardware acceleration where available, as well as support for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF). Macs with the Intel Kaby Lake processor offer hardware support for Main 10 profile 10-bit hardware decoding, those with the Intel Skylake processor support Main profile 8-bit hardware decoding, and those with AMD Radeon 400 series graphics also support full HEVC decoding.[5] In addition, audio codecs FLAC and Opus will also be supported, but not in iTunes.[11][12]\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_High_Sierra\r\n\r\nChanges > System > Media @chipped did you even try to open those 4K HDR files on High-Sierra on a MBP 2016?\r\nMy guess is that you haven't despite your claims. There's no way you could even open those files on a MBP 2016 with any of the Apple player. (quicktime or safari) They are using dolbyvision variant, and there's no public decoders for those yet, not even VLC will play them.\r\n\r\nFor the others, why do you think this thread exists and so many people report playback issue? (stuttering and so forth).\r\n\r\nEdit: on a MBP 15\" late 2016 (i7 2.9Ghz skylake i7-6920HQ with Radeon Pro 460) the 4K SDR plays in Qt.\r\nVTDecpderXPCService in Activity Monitor is around 108% CPU, QT itself around 8% CPU.\r\nSo all software decoding.\r\n\r\nanyhow, I'm done.... obviously wasting my time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Ok, my MBP is:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) - 10.13.2\r\nIntel Iris Graphics 550 1536 MB\r\n\r\nIt does play in QuickTime Player, but shoots the processor well over 100%.\r\n @jyavenard I figured out your stuttering problem. I have attached a screen recording, read this first and then watch it.\r\n\r\nYou can see the little \"d\" or \"i\" in my menu bar. This is an app called gfxCardStatus and it indicates Dedicated in use or Integrated in use. If you click on it shows it any Dependencies that are asking for the Dedicated graphics card. I always turn off Automatic Graphics Switching on my MacBook Pro so it runs off the Radeon Pro all the time using this app.\r\n\r\nYou guys having probably have Automated Graphics Switching turned on (you can control this in System Preferences > Energy Saver OR select Discrete only in gfxCardStatus menu bar menu. NOTE Must be done after each reboot for either method) and its causing your stuttering problem. Quicktime does not tell macOS it needs a Dependency, so the system doesn't switch to the Radeon Pro. This seems like a flaw and I may submit a bug report about it.\r\n\r\nYou can see when I manually switch to the Radeon Pro that the Frame Rate is perfect and the Processor on the Radeon is loaded up. This indicates Hardware Acceleration is working on the Radeon Pro. When I switch to Automated Graphics Switching the Integrated Intel is in use and it stutters, you can also see the intel GPU is idle as its being software decoded.\r\n\r\nLink to video https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfKLAp2NpYxs9RWaRk2bUoReOvxe0Ero/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nLink to gfxCardStatus https://gfx.io\r\n\r\nThe app I'm using to monitor CPU and GPU stats is iStat Menus https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\r\n\r\nYou're welcome \ud83d\udc4d \r\n  \r\n   @mattvlasach Does it stutter? @mattvlasach I checked the screensaver and it is HEVC Main 10 profile, your Skylake CPU can only hardware accelerate up to Main 8 profile. That's why your CPU usage is high and it's probably stuttering.\r\n\r\nThere you go, stuttering mystery solved. Just have to do a bit of research :)\r\n\r\nScreenshot attached.\r\n<img width=\"598\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-07 at 1 36 17 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1430701/34645971-39151c26-f3b0-11e7-9f38-1b63d3fd04b0.png\">\r\n\r\nJust incase you missed my post before referencing the Hardware Acceleration capabilities, I'll post it here again.\r\n\r\n\u201cmacOS High Sierra adds support for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), with hardware acceleration where available, as well as support for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF).

I haven't had a chance to try your previous recommendation involving Auto Graphics Switching.  That said, given your latest post, I assume that it will not make any improvement in my case due to lack of hardware support for Main 10?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this even makes any sense, but is transcoding to Main 8 possible? @mattvlasach You wouldn't have Automated Graphics Switching as you only have one GPU.\r\n\r\nYou can try downloads this 4K clip which is 8 bit (Main 8) and play it. I tried it using my Intel GPU and it was super smooth and low CPU usage. Hardware Acceleration working well.\r\n\r\nLink http://4ksamples.com/4k-uhd-fireworks-sample/\r\n   The AMD card isn't used for decoding yet despite what the wikipedia entry state (since anyone can modify it, it's not a hard thing to do)\r\n\r\nFor the the 4K videos forcing the AMD cards with gfxStatus gives identical results above as the default, that is:\r\n1- 10 bits videos above aren't played\r\n2- 8 bits 4K ones shows very high CPU usage\r\n\r\nUsing a 2017 MBP with 7th gen intel however works as expected.\r\n\r\nIf Apple didn't automatically switch the GPU to one that can play the content, I would lodge a bug with Apple.\r\nThere should never be any needs to force which GPU is in use. @jyavenard \r\n1. Did you try 10 bit SDR or HDR?\r\n\r\n2. Did you try the 8 bit one I linked above? Maybe your sample is incompatible. Download MediaInfo and provide a screenshot.\r\n\r\n3. Where is your evidence that Apple is not using AMD card for decoding? If you watch my screen recording you can clearly see the AMD GPU processor is working when I play the 4K SDR screensaver with Automated Graphics Switching turned off.\r\n\r\n4. gfxCardStatus simply toggles the Automated Graphics Switching in System Preferences. You don't actually need it to force the AMD GPU. I use it because its nice and easy and displays useful info. All my comments are related to the issue at play. That is *this* bug and the videos provided by https://sylvan.apple.com/Aerials/2x/entries.json (listed in https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/378#issuecomment-337645247)\r\nI don't care about other videos you may find elsewhere. It's about the videos HERE that don't play properly.\r\n\r\nIn your screen recording, we can clearly see the CPU increasing and staying steady the moment you start playback. 25%+ if the GPU was in use isn't normal, it should be around 5%.\r\n\r\n3- talking at WWDC with the engineers involved.\r\n\r\nI've asked my contacts at AMD about the state of HEVC playback and if it has dedicated decoding circuits, or if it's like VP9: they use an OpenCL decoder (so it's accelerated not fully decoded).\r\nA clear issue with their VP9 HW decoder, is that the power usage is fairly high (above 30W) which makes it mostly unsuitable on MBP. The fans start spinning at a fairly high rate making the MBP very loud.\r\nOn Desktop it doesn't matter, on laptop that's not acceptable even if the capabilities are there.\r\n\r\n4. You certainly need to make the switch manually, otherwise your entire earlier comment is irrelevant. @jyavenard The CPU is at 25% because of the screen recording. Usually it\u2019s around 15%.\r\n\r\nThe videos do play properly, the SDR videos play fine. You can see that in my screen recording.\r\n\r\nI solved your \u201cstuttering issue\u201d, which was really that you just didn\u2019t know you had to use the AMD GPU to fix the stutter.\r\n\r\nHDR is not supported by QuickTime so I can\u2019t test it. My stuttering issue? When did *I* ever state I had a stuttering issue?\r\n\r\nYou solved nothing, nor should you assume what a person knows.\r\n\r\nForcing AMD serves no purpose. You keep creating strawman arguments by \"solving\" issues you invented and that people do not have in the first place. \r\n\r\nPeople with 13\" MBP don't care about AMD. If they have a MBP with a skylake they can't play some content.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'm only restating what I first posted.  @jyavenard \r\n\r\n> My stuttering issue?

Will load up but images appears distorted. You can tell movement is occurring in the background, but the image itself does not correctly display. Attempted to uninstall and reinstall to no avail. Checked the logs and do not see any errors that have to do with the screen saver \r\n\r\nI attempted taking a screenshot of the distortion so that you could see what I mean and the screen shot actually shows the correct image. \r\n\r\nThe image is displayed correctly very briefly prior to the image being distorted. It appears that when the image starts moving is when the distortion occurs. \r\n\r\nDisabling automatic graphic switching prevents the issue from occurring. This was not the case prior to High Sierra.  I just want to add \ud83d\udc4d to @ultiferrago's \ud83d\udc46 comment.\r\n\r\nTo me it looks like the frames are playing out of order - or the video is being rendered twice?\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc7e \ud83d\udc9c  I was having problems with the videos playing weirdly too! Thanks, @alistairmcmillan!!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc7e \ud83d\udc9c  I have witnessed the problem on a 16:10 display (MacBook Air MID 2013) but not on a 16:9 display (Mac Mini MID 2011 attached to a HD TV). Both running 10.13 GM. Hope it helps narrow it down. It is working on High Sierra (GM) for me on my iMac Retina and on a 2015 MacBook Pro. It is not working on a brand new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. On my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) - the non-touchbar version - it generally works, but right at the start of the screensaver it appears to start frozen for a split second, then flicker as if it would try to rescale, then start playing normally (at what I believe is the correct aspect ratio). For what it's worth this is tested on internal screen only, running the new default resolution of what looks like 1440x900. Running the GM - `10.13 Beta (17A360a)`. Hi @alistairmcmillan I sure have. I can also report that with the GM of High Sierra the problem appears to have disappeared for me.\r\n\r\nHowever that should not also preclude reporting here as sometimes software can break across upgrades. The number of apps updated shortly after a new OS release that list changes as \"Now compatible with New Version of OS\" or \"Fix Issues with New Version of OS\" are testament to that.\r\n\r\nBy notifying here as well as with Apple, the best chance exists for the right person to identify the issue. I did not assume the problem was with Aerial, or with Apple. I just reported on both fronts.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc7e \ud83d\udc9c  I can confirm I have the same issue on my 2017 15in Touchbar MBP with the High Sierra GM only when running integrated graphics. Switching to discrete graphics works, and is my current work around.

The MBP switches automatically to the Intel HD Graphics chipset to save power and only turns on the Radeon Pro when it detects that it's needed.\r\n\r\nYou can force the MBP to use the Radeon Pro chipset in the Energy Saver panel in Settings. Getting this issue as well on my mid 2015 15\" mbp using integrated graphics - discrete chip works fine. I have a 2017 MBP 13\" w/o discreet graphics and I am encountering this issue Never used High Sierra beta, just updated to High Sierra public release on a 15\" MacBook Pro 2017 and this screensaver doesn't work. Whenever it's triggered, it gives the same glitchy effect you see when you have GPU issues. I have the same problem when I'm playing Final Fantasy XIV or War Thunder in my MacBook Pro 13\" 2016 without Touch Bar at the release version of macOS High Sierra. \r\n Also having flickering issues on my MacBook Pro 15\" Mid2015 model after updating to HS I'm having the issue with MacBook Pro 15\" Touch Bar 2017 - talked to Apple support and they don't seem to have a real solution yet. Turing off Automatic Graphics Switching does make the issue appear less often though. Adding my stats here to potentially help debugging. I am having this flickering issue on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\r\n**Processor** 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7\r\n**Memory** 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\r\n**Graphics** Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB adding my specs and some more context...\r\nI have a MacBook Pro w/Touchbar (13-inch, 2017)\r\nwhen connected to a Samsung 23.5-inch monitor, the Aerial videos work fine (on both screens)\r\nbut without the external monitor connected, the video is distorted as described above.\r\nThis started happening after upgrading to High Sierra. Same issues here on a Macbook 13 inch 2014 after the update to HS Having similar issues on my 15\" mid 2017 MBP. Switching the integrated Intel Iris graphics card off helped. I'm also seeing the issue on a 13\" Retina MBP Early 2015 and 15\" Retina MBP 2013. However, I suspect the graphic flickers are a general High Sierra issue rather than specific to Arial.  Also seeing this on my MacBook Pro touch Bar (15-inch, 2017) running High Sierra (10.13 17A365) when trying to view on the built-in display. Worked fine when connected to external display, but think that the issue is battery vs. power supply. As as workaround, turning off Settings > Energy Saver > Automatic graphics switching allows the screensaver to display when running on battery. I've read through this thread twice, and I don't see a referenced Radar with Apple for High Sierra GM--am I missing it?  Are we sure it's an Apple bug, and not a problem with how Aerial works? Here's what it looks like on my MBP 2017.\r\n\r\n![img_20171001_100026](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32578033/31289949-b9c087b8-aa98-11e7-8753-511ca44086e6.jpg)\r\n @AsydRayn I have exactly the same screen like your photo. I also posted an issue (closed due to duplicate of this issue) #398  @mayhew1955 Oddly, I don't have any of those options under \"energy saver\" on my MBP w/TB 2017. Under Displays setting, I have Default or Scaled.\r\n\r\n> You can force the MBP to use the Radeon Pro chipset in the Energy Saver panel in Settings. apparently these options aren\u2019t available on a 13\u201d MBP. it doesn\u2019t come with the alt chipset Just to confirm @drewwilliams' comment, on a 15\" 2017 MacBook Pro running High Sierra 10.13, de-selecting \"Automatic graphics switching\" in System Preferences Energy Saver allows video playback in Aerial without problem. Re-enabling this setting and the graphics glitching returns. It appears the new supplemental high Sierra update that just dropped fixed the issue on my MBP15\" in integrated gfx mode.  So not likely an aerial bug. Spoke too soon.  The problem does happen, just not quite as fast. Having the same issue on my 2017 13\" MacBook Pro w TouchBar. It works fine on my 27\" 4K Monitor. Do we know this happens on the internal display but not on an external? @jackhcurtis For me it's limited to the internal display; works fine on external displays. Yeah, with external it works. Macbook 12inch 2017. Worked fine on the same OS version with 2015 macbook I think.\r\nBTW the workaround \"show with clock\" works, but of course - it's with clock :) Thanks for the workaround \"show with clock\", it's better than nothing ! I have two MBP 15\" with touchbar.. aerial is not working on the more recent one. Both have automatic graphics switching checked in the settings/energy saver stop screen.. I wonder whether this issue I am experiencing only on the latest MBP is due to differences in graphics cards..\r\nThe one that has no issue has Intel HD Graphics 530 (24-Bit Color).. the latest MBP has Intel HD Graphics 630 (30-Bit Color) I have a 2017 Macbook Pro 13\" without touch bar; I consistently see the same screen as @AsydRayn. Graphics switching isn't an option in my Energy Saver preferences, so I don't know how to fix. I'm on the latest versions of Arial and of High Sierra. Perhaps worth noting: I have caching turned off to conserve the limited space on my MacBook. @Luke, there is no fix yet. But you can get it to work by turning on the clock.\r\n\r\nOn Oct 11, 2017, at 9:36 PM, Luke Deen Taylor <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a 2017 Macbook Pro 13\" without touch bar; I consistently see the same screen as @AsydRayn<https://github.com/asydrayn>.

Strangely it works fine on all displays clock-free if any external display is connected, but looks like the display is dead if it's showing only on the internal display. Displaying the clock with just the internal display also works fine for whatever reason I'm running 10.13.1 macOS High Sierra on my MacBook Pro 17\" with 2.8 GHz Intel Core 17 Processor and, following ultiferrago's suggestion, the graphical glitches I was getting in Safari (extreme pixellation, negative imaging on at least one e-newspaper site), I disabled Automatic Graphics Switching in Energy Saver in Preferences, and issues seems to be resolved.

I observed that when I was working to document this bug using Quicktime to perform a screen capture appears to also resolve the issue. Anytime I was running a screen capture Aerial played back great. When I was not running a screen capture I ran into the same described interlacing issue.  Hi folks, \r\njust wanted to add to the thread how my MacBook Pro w/ touch bar is behaving\r\n after upgrading to High Sierra. At first I got the same scrambled screen shown earlier in this thread by @AsydRayn \r\nAfter forcing discrete graphics I get a static image from the video forever, nothing moving. Now switching back to integrated graphics (monitored by gfxCardStatus helper) I don't get the scrambled screen anymore but the static image as well. Not sure if this helps - hope this can be fixed soon as I love this screensaver! Thanks\r\n![about_this_mac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4440614/34735335-63c7f43c-f56f-11e7-8729-87829520f5b7.jpg)\r\n!\r\n Hi Ryan just a note on the previous comment to help clarify things though it\u2019s not my comment: on 13.2 about this mac no longer shows the Radeon card, so there is a good chance the guy\u2019s computer does have a discrete graphics card.

I hope a fix is forthcoming!\r\n\r\n[Here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441546/35937431-103c730e-0bfb-11e8-8653-41d1a689cc50.jpg) is a sample of the specific issue I'm experiencing; it looks like the video is not at the correct aspect ratio, resulting in horizontal gaps at the top and bottom of the screen. The image you see behind the video is the current desktop wallpaper.\r\n\r\n**Hardware:** MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\r\n**OS:** 10.13.3\r\n Me too! same issue , its not fixed yet on latest HS 10.13.3 Confirmed issue still appearing on 10.13.3. Using a 2017 Macbook, so no option to change graphics chipset. Is it me or turns out I fixed it by enabling \"Show with clock\" in the screen saver settings?\r\n\r\n*Config: \r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\r\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.3* @buzzb0x : Yes, when you enabling \"Show with clock\" this prevent you macbook to switch from your graphic card to the integrated graphics. If you don't want the clock on your screensaver just disable \"Automatic graphic switching\" on your macbook settings (\"Energy Saver\" tab)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17025808/36901290-fbcf8616-1e26-11e8-9746-f56a1d21dbbd.png)\r\n I found some weird behavior. When I only use internal display of my MBP 13 2017, It glitches. but when I use my iMac as target display mode, It's working. even in MBP display. Hope this will helps for fixing issues.. @BenjaminSouchet I don't even have that option, my config doesn't have a dedicated GCU. I have a MacBook Pro 13\" (MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) with integrated graphics, running 10.13.3. Enabling the clock feature results i smooth video; without the clock option, I get the zigzag garbled video. So for me this is a workaround for the moment as also noticed by @buzzb0x  2017 MBP with touch bar. Showing clock also fixes the problem for me. I do think though this might be a problem with the hardware and not necessarily the software. Im going to head into an apple store and show them this thread. I actually already had the display replaced because of this issue but it seems its still happening to me. There is no such a problem on earlier macOS versions with the same hardware, so it's definitely software problem.  Ah ok. Didnt noticed that in this thread. Ill go over it again, thanks. Didn't read the whole thread - but I have a brand new Macbook Pro 13\" 2017 model, and the issue is reproducible as long as I _don't_ select `Show with clock`. If I _do_ select that setting, the screensaver works fine. There is only integrated graphics on this laptop as well, no discrete chip. Just installed on a MBP 13 w/o Touch Bar and can replicate diranged's test. It looks like this is resolved with 10.13.4. I just updated, and tried the screen saver, removing the `show with clock` option, and after an initial video stutter the playback is smooth.  Mine isn't :-( I suppose I should mention that my hardware is `MacBookPro14,3 w/ Intel HD Graphics 630 & Radeon Pro 560`. (i.e. MBP 15\" 2017 w/TouchBar) I can also confirm that the clock workaround is no longer needed for my setup with 10.13.4:\r\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports)\r\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 650 1536 MB Just noticed that when I received a notification about a received email, the screensaver started playing correctly, but as soon as the notification faded it distorted again. This has resolved for me with 10.13.4 on a MacBook Pro Touch Bar (15-inch, 2017). This has resolved for me with 10.13.4 on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2015). I can also confirm that the clock workaround is no longer needed for my setup with 10.13.4:\r\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017, 2.9 GHz, Intel HD Graphics 630) @gwynnebaer I have the same setup as you and it's still not fixed for me when I untick clock. @newtonuk, your experience is exactly the same as mine...clock unticked, I get screen scramble until a notification arrives. Once the notification disappears, it's back to the garbled screen again. While macOS 10.13.4 may have resolved this issue for those of you using a MacBook **Pro** it is definitely still crashing on my new 2017 MacBook. Interestingly enough, it was never an issue on my 2015 MacBook that was running the screen saver on the same version of macOS. I'm not sure if the problem is with the screensaver or with macOS but I've submitted detailed feedback to Apple just in case it's on their end. In the meantime I still have to use the \"Show with clock\" option to get it to work. This issue was resolved for my 2017 MacBook in the macOS 10.13.5 public beta. I no longer have to use the \"Show with clock\" option to get the screen saver to work.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Apparently I spoke too soon. This seems to be resolved when my MacBook is hooked up to an external monitor. Still crashing otherwise. Still a problem for me with 10.13.4 when \"show with clock\" is off or integrated graphics is on. I'm getting the version with a cropped, zoomed in central video and a second zoomed-out copy playing behind it, visible above and below. I'm getting a horizontally-stretched version of the video flickering across the screen **whilst the brightness of the monitor changes**\u2014at all other times it's back to normal in 10.13.4.\r\n\r\n[Another rubbish video](https://youtu.be/nfVaVG7xNEs). Auto-brightness response triggered with a torch. OSX 10.13.4, 15\" 2017 MBP (w/touch bar)\r\nIssue resolves by disabling graphics switching in energy saver settings.\r\nIssue appears to be with integrated graphics solution (drivers?! what is this, a PC?), but not with the discrete graphics chip on systems w/touch bar.\r\nI do not have this issue (same OS version) on my other MBP (13\" 2015) or Air (2015). I have a 2017 15-in MacBook Pro. I see the same scrambled images and have now twice seen spontaneous reboots, which I attribute to Aerial. Fixed in Mojave Developer Beta 6 for me Works for me in this iteration, even without the clock, on a 2017 13\" MB Pro w/Touchpad that doesn't have an \"automatic graphics switching\" option. Fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14 Beta (18A353d)   Have not been able to get it to run for a while, and I now have a new iMac 21.5 in 2017.  I used the migration method to move everything to the new iMac, and the Ariel option appears in the screen saver list in preferences. But it doesn't work  - screen just goes dark.  \r\n\r\nThis is my first time to write an issue here, so maybe it has been previously addressed.  Agreed. Doesn't work on Sierra 10.12.6 :( I see a black screen on preview sorry. Oddly it now appears to be working :)\n\nOn Mon, Sep 11, 2017 at 8:51 PM, Alistair McMillan <notifications@github.com\n> wrote:\n\n> @andrewjohnstrong <https://github.com/andrewjohnstrong> Do you have the\n> latest version installed?

My son showed me that in  our Xfinity ISP router protected browsing was on, and then  how to turn it off.  Then it worked.  Thanks for the help.  Hello,\r\nThanks very much for making Aerials!  I was playing around with it on a macOS 10.13 High Sierra developer beta, and I noticed Aerials seems to have a flickering scaling issue (it rapidly switches between a narrow/wider scaling), and occasionally shows some other display issues like white bars flickering at the top and bottom of the display.\r\nLet me know if there's any additional info or logging I may be able to gather to help.\r\nThanks!\r\nH Sorry, just noticed #374 already pointed out High Sierra issues, I'll close this one.  Is that a code update for compatibility with the public betas of Mac OS X High Sierra?\r\n\r\nI get technicolor lines and bubbles when displaying the screensaver on the public betas (latest as of today).   Hi there,\r\nJust a suggestion for enhancement. I liked the option to play different screensavers on different displays, but for the sake of energy conservation and not having so much happening when nothing is, making only 1 display run the screensaver in a multiple display setup would be the best, in my humble opinion!\r\n\r\nCheers  cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of mac on Sierra\r\n it works, thank you  I 'accidentally' clicked on the 'Download Now'-Button and now I can't stop the download of ALL videos. I suggest putting also a 'Stop Now'-Button next to the 'Download Now'-Button so that I don't have to wait until infinity until ALL videos are downloaded ;-)  panoramic is probably the right word.\r\nit would be nice to display single screen saver spanning over multiple monitor.   Hi there,\r\nI have installed this on a new Mac Touchbar 2017 15 inch and when in screensaver mode, the picture will appear on screen, but it doesn't move when not in preview mode (only moves in preview mode).\r\nThank you Hi, yes I do have the cached box checked-- thanks for any help or suggestions That worked! Thank you!  It would be so much more awesome if Aerial could decide, based on user's local time, to either play day or night videos.  this branch has that feature https://github.com/lhandel/Aerial  Installed and all wallpapers were cached through preview but when it should pop up after a certain amount of time the \"Message\" screensaver pops up instead. Same here; also, sometimes Aerials doesn't autoplay when screensaver is activated, and reverts to this. OS X 10.13 Beta (17A291m) @alistairmcmillan yeah I have Aerial selected. I have also selected another screensaver, rebooted, checked to see if other screensaver works, then picked aerial, rebooted, but still same issue 10.12.5 Chiming in. Tried to replicate if it works on preview and both cases (no play, message) appeared. Still in High Sierra Beta.  @alistairmcmillan Yeah it works perfectly in preview but not on its own with a timer.\r\n\r\nI could have sworn I commented on how this is a hackintosh... although I don't see how such a simple software issue like a screensaver could be related (especially since all other screensavers seem to work) @alistairmcmillan Will debug and report! Just did a test and it only played a second or two of movie, and it was cached. When I record in QuickTime it suddenly works (I'm on High Sierra as well) Also for me the messages screensaver doesn't come up, the screensaver runs for a second and then it begins to stutter @alistairmcmillan Yes, some of them but all show problems, beta 5, on a Mac Hi,\r\nI have the problem as well. My MacBook is a 2017 and I use High Sierra Beta 7 (17A352a). With Sierra it works, with High Sierra I see only small Stripes on the hole Screen. The Videos direct played works without Problems.\r\nCan you help me?\r\nGreetings from Berlin/Germany\r\nMarkus I can confirm a similar issue in high sierra final. I'm also on a hackintosh. Any other screensaver I use gets triggered after the correct interval, but Aerial just does nothing for me. If I use the hot corner aerial comes up immediately and works perfectly, but if I set to 1 minute and wait for timeout no screensaver is shown. Setting screensaver to \"Origami\" or any other causes the 1 minute timeout to work perfectly, it's only Aerial that seems to do nothing.  Any reason why these videos aren't at the same resolution as the Apple TV videos? Watching these videos on a 27\u02ba iMac next to an Apple TV, the Apply TV videos seem significantly higher in resolution. Are the full-res videos available only to Apple TVs? Good question. I also noticed that the videos were low quality (they were about 720p to 1080p, as far as I remember). I thought it was strange as Apple most likely has higher resolutions. Have you done a side-by-side comparison of an Apple TV to a 27\u201d iMac? They don't at all appear to be the same resolution. Am I the only one seeing this? Before writing off my report, I would try it and see for yourself if it looks the same. Could there be some other explanation for the poor video quality I'm seeing? @alistairmcmillan that's a pity! I was really hoping they had some higher resolution versions somewhere. Doesn't make sense with the 1080p Apple TV, though. Definitely a shame. Thanks for the detailed explanation. \r\n\r\nDo we think there's some other explanation for the lower image quality? Perhaps how the video is unpacked and rendered on the Mac? The absence of some magic my TV is doing? @chriscalo Maybe you're looking at it wrong  Hello, Only my com Mac has this message.\r\nHow can I see those sunning landscape again? \r\n\r\nThank you. Thank you! \r\nI can see again! : )   this vision of the screensaver is slow on my MacBook Pro 13inch i5 core 8gb ram and it seem to need some time to load some time it crash  If I was downloading something, and then I left the Mac and the Aerial screen saver active, then I return find all my downloads were stopped.  U know , for Chinese users , it's not easy to download these videos. The connection always be reset for interrupt. I look up video download url from your code, however, found nothing.  \r\nCould U please tell the url where the Aerial download the video ? Then, I can download them in special method, and then put it in my folder.\r\n\r\nMany thanks. \r\nYou did a great job, and i love this project... thanks   I'm running the native resolution on my Macbook (2560 x 1600) and the screensaver looks terrible.  Is there anything that can be done about this?  Any plans to add the new screensavers that have been added to the AppleTV? I haven't seen the LAX one, but I may be missing it..? Have you guys seen it yet?  macOS 10.12.4/10.12.5 I have been having a problem with my network being completely tied up for minutes at a time, sometimes for half an hour, several times a day. It will be tied up to the point that Safari cannot connect to the Internet and neither can Mail. I studied the log files I can find to discover that an unknown process was trying to access NIC ports one after another numbered in the 50,000-60,000 range.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that something is trying to refresh its data from the Internet on its own schedule which is unknown to me, but interferes with my business correspondence. \r\n\r\nI turned off Aerial screensaver and the network immediately cleared. I believe that the Aerial code does not work properly with the networking changes Apple must have made in macOS 10.12.4. \r\n\r\nI should be able to control the frequency and time of screensaver image updates in the 'Screensaver Options' section of System Preferences. This would allow me the control I need to keep Aerial out of the way during business hours.\r\n\r\nAlbert  Wondering if there's any easy way to determine whether I have the latest version (and if not, which version I have) installed. I know I installed Aerial quite  a while ago and according to my `brew list` output, I didn't install using Homebrew. Not sure if Aerial would've auto-updated since install, but if it hasn't, I want to update it. Hesitant to do so by simply downloading master.zip and replacing my existing install at `/Library/Screen Savers/` though (unless that's the recommended method).\r\n\r\nIn case there's some way to tell from what my current install looks like:\r\n![snip20170524_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10353532/26416239/29df1c92-4083-11e7-879e-6d88fd747f4d.png)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! @alistairmcmillan I appreciate your reply. Would you mind clarifying how you can tell I had an old version?\r\n\r\nStrange thing is that after using `brew cask install aerial` successfully, Aerial is installed into `~/Library/Screen Savers/`(rather than `/Library/Screen Savers/`), but the files are exactly the same as what were in the screenshot I posted earlier. Here's the current state, reflecting the `brew cask` install:\r\n![snip20170524_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10353532/26429926/0486fed0-40b8-11e7-9c2c-8e2ce63fca6c.png)\r\n\r\nI've also confirmed that the `brew cask` installation is identical to the release available at https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2, per screenshot of file comparison:\r\n![snip20170524_4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10353532/26429971/44bfade4-40b8-11e7-8930-b31f914a1435.png)\r\n looks like the current cask version is v1.2\r\nhttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/aerial.rb @njm2112 \r\n\r\nAlso, try this link out; it looks helpful for updating a cask:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/31968664/upgrade-all-the-casks-installed-via-homebrew-cask\r\n\r\nI would imagine if that link does not work you can uninstall the cask and then reinstall the cask. In that circumstance the new cask will be official published cask.\r\n\r\nI am guessing that you would only need the most up to date cask for speed fixes or other workarounds introduced with the new commits. My understanding is that \"In terms of the videos\" if apple posts more videos on Apple TV they will automatically be included into Aerial. Can you confirm? Having 55 videos listed as shown in the image below.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-05-24 at 7 47 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11463275/26430234/d2f48dcc-40b9-11e7-8ef7-44b47fa8df31.png)\r\n\r\nI just counted them all up. I have many of mine un-toggled.  seeing a compatibility issue on macOS 10.12.4 on a 2015 MBP. After install, seeing a message in the Screen Saver preview that says \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS.\"\r\n\r\n(btw - this is an awesome idea!) Hey @adilmajid, is this when you install for an individual user or across all users?\r\n\r\nAlso, is this similar to #4 ? \r\nThere is a workaround I reported in that issue. I never made a pull request about it but I did put the workaround in my companion app that puts it on your desktop. https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/Aerial_Desktop  it can;t open   Hey there,\r\n\r\nThanks for making this great saver! I've got it on all of my machines! Presently, (on mac at least) pressing the space bar will pause one of the screens. This could be useful, but I think an option to enable or disable spacebar and arrow keys controls in the settings would be great. Most of the time I slam my space bar to end the screen saver, then sit and wonder why nothing happened, realize it just paused a screen, and then hit a different key to return to the desktop. \r\n\r\nAdding that would be great! Thanks again\r\n\r\n-Alyx  I was downloading all videos and I though it was stuck at something. There is a small piece of progess missing. It's just a visual thing, but I though I'd report it anyway.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"404\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-05-14 at 18 21 11\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1183790/26035794/79627920-38d2-11e7-8adb-659a43798f47.png\">\r\n\r\n  @alistairmcmillan, works on my macOS Sierra 10.12.4, \r\n\r\nAvoid requiring users to manually change screensaver to Aerial.\r\nHowever, if they do manually change screensaver after the command it overrides what has been done.(So no harm will be done.)\r\n\r\nTo automatically set as default screensaver add this <b>terminal command</b> after receiving credentials\r\n### Examples:\r\n\r\nto find out current default screen saver:\r\n0) ```defaults -currentHost read com.apple.screensaver```\r\n\r\n1) to set screensaver as Shell:\r\n```defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver modulePath -string \"/System/Library/Screen Savers/Shell.saver\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleName -string \"Shell\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict moduleName Shell path /System/Library/Screen\\ Savers/Shell.saver/ type 0```\r\n\r\n2) to set screensaver as Flurry:\r\n```defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver modulePath -string \"/System/Library/Screen Savers/Flurry.saver\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleName -string \"Flurry\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict moduleName Flurry path /System/Library/Screen\\ Savers/Flurry.saver/ type 0```\r\n\r\n3) to set screensaver as Aerial ... aerial is at a different path so slight difference.\r\n```defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver modulePath -string \"/Library/Screen\\ Savers/Aerial.saver\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleName -string \"Aerial\";defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict moduleName Aerial path /Library/Screen\\ Savers/Aerial.saver type 0```\r\n\r\ntwo links,\r\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/159992/how-to-change-the-the-screensaver-using-terminal-without-using-preference-panel/283374#283374\r\nhttp://krypted.com/mac-security/mac-setting-screen-saver-from-the-cli/\r\n\r\nAppreciate any feedback and happy to answer any questions.\r\nIt should work on older versions of mac but let me know if any issues. \r\nI am limited in my test capabilities. (Currently only my mac personal computer)\r\nAlso I would appreciate some feedback on if this should be a pull request for Aerial. @alistairmcmillan, I imagined @JohnCoates would see the issue but I just wanted to bring this potential new usability up for discussion thats why I tagged you. I suppose I could have tagged anyone \ud83d\ude04 .  The benefit, if someone is clicking Aerial.saver, I assume they want it as their screensaver. \r\n\r\nTo your point users may not want it to enable by default. Aerial.saver currently brings up screensaver preferences. However, clicking Aerial manually is not in the Readme instructions.\r\n\r\nIf the default screensaver changes without manual interaction the screensaver preferences window will not even need to be brought up. \r\nOr the screensaver preference window could still be brought up. Users would then see Aerial already selected and be able to change to a different screensaver or back to the one they want if so inclined. \r\n\r\nUltimately the main reason to bring in the change is to make it super user friendly. My understanding is that people only click Aerial.saver once. And this would enable with the click of Aerial.saver the downloading and setting screensaver so that everything works in one click instead of 2 clicks and a scroll. Please explain to this novice the differences between:\r\nto set screensaver as Shell:\r\nto set screensaver as Flurry:\r\nto set screensaver as Aerial: @tvwillie, Each one is an individual command and doing the same thing, setting default screensaver. \"Flurry\" and \"Shell\" are other ScreenSavers. I included those as examples so people can verify default ScreenSaver is changing when those commands are run on the terminal.\r\n\r\nThe intent is not for a User to run these commands. Rather to include the \"set sceensaver as Aerial\" command inside the Aerial program so that at one click of \"Aerial.saver\" the screensaver is set up for the user. The other commands: \"as Flurry\" and \"as Shell\" are just examples. \r\nHope that is clear. \ud83d\ude04  @alistairmcmillan, that the screensaver should run the command to make itself the default. \ud83d\udc4d  @alistairmcmillan, precisely! \r\nAt step your <b>step 2</b>, currently Users have to manually set Aerial as default ScreenSaver. \r\n\r\nThis would automatically set Aerial as default ScreenSaver. \r\nMacOS could still launch System Preferences. \r\nOr the program could change to no longer need to launch System Preferences \r\n(that is a usability decision) \r\nThe default screensaver would be set regardless with this implementation. \r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this enhancement: check out my comment on #4 which if incorporated into \"Aerial.saver\" would use this command to automatically solve #4 an open problem users currently have to manually fix. @alistairmcmillan; I will check. \r\nregardless, though it could be useful to automatically solve #4.\r\n\r\ngoing off memory... You are correct if I already have Aerial installed.\r\nBut I will uninstall and install Aerial and report the results \ud83d\ude04 . @alistairmcmillan, I checked here is the breakdown:\r\n1) (optional) If you remove Aerial screensaver\r\n2) go to ScreenSaver window and click on a different ScreenSaver. \r\n3) click on Aerial.saver(try installing it again.)\r\n4) Aerial is no longer my default ScreenSaver. \r\n\r\n@alistairmcmillan do you get the same results in your environment?\r\n\r\n<b>Summary:</b> I think that if you simply uninstall and reinstall aerial it remembered that it was your old default ScreenSaver. However if you are a new user it will not put Aerial as the default. To make the program run the user currently has to do two actions:\r\n1) click Aerial.saver\r\n2) click Aerial default\r\nThey would not need to click aerial. They could simply put their computer to sleep or activate their ScreenSaver through a hot corner.\r\n\r\n@alistairmcmillan, if you want it to run terminal command:\r\n```/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/./ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine;```\r\n\r\nbut ScreenSaver Preferences window may still want to be open in the event that a user wants to customize which aerial ScreenSavers they want to include or not include.  Hi John. My bandwidth usage has sky-rocketed since using Aerial. Love the screen saver though. I'm trying to install it remotely but I'm not having much luck. I tried clicking on the link to Brew Cask but I'm coming up with dead ends. I'm not a developer so I may need some layman instructions. Any help you can provide is appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJustin  Pictures appear MUCH sharper on Apple TV. Can this be fixed for 27\" Retina screen? Understand. Thinking about it, as Apple preps the videos for the Apple TV it would be pointless to make them higher res than what the Apple TV can show. Once that has moved on to 4K, I'm sure it will be better. The illusion of a crisper image on the Apple TV is just that.  You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOs\r\nmine is: \r\nmacOS Sierra\r\nversion 10.12.4\r\niMac 21.5 late 2013 Im on that same version, my only difference is that I am on a 15\" MacBook Pro late 2012 (Retina).  Hope to support 4K video  This screensaver is absolutely gorgeous, and even better than the version on my apple tv (customizable, set as wallpaper etc, its amazing!) the only thing its missing from the apple tv version is it blanks out for a second and loads the next. would it be possible to add a nice cross fade or fade through black transition between videos? that would be the cherry on top! thank you!  Hi. As you know, internal space in Macbooks Air are very limited. So it will be very good if download function only download the videos that are already selected, saving some space. Its a filter in code and i think it will be very well accepted by everyone.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPaludo\r\nBrazil Whow! \r\nThat's a nice new @alistairmcmillan. I have tried using the cache option, and it does not work as (I) expected... I will try this way you said about. Thanks for your help! \r\n\r\n I want to use \"download now\" to get all the cache video first.\r\nBut after click it, it show downloading greenland(which I didn't select) and stuck...\r\nI already check the cache folder it have some other video downloaded(selected before but deselect didn't remove old files)  IE, to be able to choose sets of favorites\r\nlike only night time screensaver to be shown at night Yeah same here. I think I've posted a thread regards to this before and someone else too. Don't think we've got an update on that just yet.  Since Updating to Sierra the screensaver seems to freeze often. i have tried downloading all the videos as well as reinstalling the screensaver.  There seems to be an issue that the CPU usage peaks. When the Aerial screensaver is running, the fans start to work and they don't stop till the screen saver stops. This was not happening before. I did a clean restart because I thought this was another problem, but it persists.\r\n\r\nI have macOS Sierra 10.12.3, retina 13 early 2015.\r\n\r\nIf you need any more information, please let me know. The videos are cached. And I have the last version.\n\n\n> On Mar 23, 2017, at 8:26 PM, Alistair McMillan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Which version of Aerial are you running?

Unfortunately, I am having this problem too. New iMac out of the box running OS Sierra 10.12, upgraded to 10.12.6. Installed Aerial and got the dreaded message. Tried the fix a few times. Also deleted and reinstalled. I won't have this iMac after today, but I'd be interested in the other steps to try to establish what might be causing the error.  Quick follow up for those who might be looking for answer. I had given up on using Aerial, chose another screen saver, then left the machine alone and running. When I came back to it, about 30 minutes later, I opened the system prefs/screensaver and noticed that Aerial now showed a picture in the choose frame. I chose it and it worked. Maybe it needed time to populate a video? At any rate, that process worked and it's up and running in all it's splendor. Ok. That's fine. My point was that I followed your instructions to open system prefs/screen saver, select Arial ScreenSaver, close System Prefs (leaving Arial Selected), then opened it expecting to see Arial work, per Your instructions. It did not work. I did this a number of times. Just did not work, period. I think this is where many people reporting having the same experience as me are getting confused. Perhaps it works every time for you, that's great. But you should understand, as many users are reporting, that the procedure you are recommending just doesn't work every time. That's all I am saying. I don't understand the where's and why's, bug or not,  but I do understand what I experienced. So maybe others can keep my experience in mind and hopefully not give up on Aerial. I think it's the best screensaver going on the Mac or any platform right now. And that is exactly why I posted my experience, due to your invitation :)  Thank you for posting the other steps. I do set up and maintain all kinds of Macs for people. If the issue with Aerial happens again, I'll send you the data. I didn't mean for my post to reflect badly on you in any way. I understand it is a bug in the OS that Apple hasn't responded to yet. I appreciate that you took the time and effort, and used your skills to bring Aerial to the Mac as a screen saver. I always set Aerial as the default screen saver, and it's a pleasure to see the look on my clients faces when I demo it for them. Ah, my bad. Thanks or your helping contribution.

Read the [comment docs](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/pull-request-comments).  Currently, I am experiencing a bug which causes the aerial videos to freeze. I am using a MacBook Pro 15\" (2016 with Touch Bar). All videos are locally cached.  ##The problem is that in nearly 99% of the cases, the screensaver freezes when playing the video \"Los Angeles - Three\" (the video which is showing the beach and the Santa Monica Pier).\r\n\r\nI would be very grateful, if you could solve this problem. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nSebastian In my case, it randomly freezes. At work I have a 3-display setup, and I set the screensaver to display different aerials on each monitor. Sometimes 1 or 2 out of the 3 screen freezes. \r\n\r\nI am running MacOS Sierra 10.12.3. It is a MacBook Pro, MacBookPro11,5. +1\r\n\r\nI am seeing the same issue. Multiple (2) monitor situation --> only one of the videos pauses while the other is playing as normal. I have not encountered a situation where both videos are in a paused state. Nor have I noticed this type of pause behavior when running with a single monitor (though I admit that I don't run in single monitor mode very often). For me, the LA beach one always freezes right from the beginning. There is another one that always freezes (I think it's the LA highway one, or the airfield one, or both maybe..). I'm on a Macbook Pro 13\" 2015. All other video's are playing fine. I also made sure I have all the video's cached, and I do.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just checked and it's actually Dubai Four and LA Three (this is the beach one) that's getting stuck for me. I just disable them for now until this is maybe fixed. It is a known bug, unfortunately unresolved yet, check here: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/278 That bug happened to me, and my power went out unexpectedly. So it booted back up and the screen was set to 720p or 1366 x 768. Before it was 1080p. So I changed it back to 1080p by holding down the option key and clicking on Scaled in Display Preferences and selecting 1080p, and now all the videos play as expected. So try setting the resolution to 720p or your screen's resolution, then switching back to whatever you had set it for to begin with, and I think maybe it'll work.  hi I have just downloaded Aerial and installed it. When I go into my screen savers to select it this message come up.\r\n\"You cannot use Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS.

Video is playing as normal when the Screensaver starts, but after some time, it always stuck there and the screen froze.  Hi John,\r\n\r\nFirst, I love this screen saver for my Mac, it catches everyones' eye and I pass it on to them. It would be cool to see the name, in some nondistractive way, of the location on the screen when the screen saver is on. So when viewing a screen from China it would display \"China\" in one of the corners either the entire time or just for several seconds once it starts.\r\n\r\nThanks for creating this package!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason  Great screen saver. I've noticed that fairly frequently Arial will freeze after switching to a new video. It will run as normal but eventually the new video will not start. Just an image. It will no longer \"fly\" so to speak. After waking up the screen, and letting Arial start again, or, starting it manually, it runs fine but will eventually freeze again. It's not on any particular video. I'm using a late 2011 iMac 21\" screen running Sierra. I have 16gb of storage. I have done restarts just to be sure there are no issues lurking. Any ideas?  Not compatible with the latest OS X :(  The previews are taking a long time to load.\r\n\r\nExpectation:\r\n1. Quickly see all available screen savers (It could be an static image for optimization, that would be more than enough)\r\n2. Disable the ones I don't like\r\n3. Clicking cache all should cache only the ones that I left marked\r\n\r\nWhat is happening:\r\n1. Preview is taking too long to load (it's probably loading the whole video. It stay black while it's not loaded (possibly related: #14))\r\n2. Not sure if cache only downloads the ones I selected (because it takes so long)\r\n\r\n[![screenshot](https://s30.postimg.org/4xawotftt/Screen_Shot_2017_02_11_at_19_11_33.png)](https://postimg.org/image/7re229hzx/)  You see this amazing aerial movies in screen saver but you don't know where they are. An option to display the location this movie was filmed will be most beneficial. Would be nice to have such option, missing it too.   # [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/317?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#317](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/317?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/commit/d73333d52ccef5f68121dd342ff1c53f59401a94?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.04%`.\n\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff            @@\n##           master    #317      +/-   ##\n=========================================\n+ Coverage   14.16%   14.2%   +0.04%     \n=========================================\n  Files          13      13              \n  Lines        1490    1521      +31     \n=========================================\n+ Hits          211     216       +5     \n- Misses       1279    1305      +26\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/317?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage \u0394 | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [Aerial/Source/Models/ManifestLoader.swift](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/compare/d73333d52ccef5f68121dd342ff1c53f59401a94...295f31241c72be10a2fa61e5b6c6a725f5843f7e?src=pr&el=tree#diff-QWVyaWFsL1NvdXJjZS9Nb2RlbHMvTWFuaWZlc3RMb2FkZXIuc3dpZnQ=) | `8.74% <\u00f8> (-0.84%)` | :x: |\n| [...urce/Controllers/PreferencesWindowController.swift](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/compare/d73333d52ccef5f68121dd342ff1c53f59401a94...295f31241c72be10a2fa61e5b6c6a725f5843f7e?src=pr&el=tree#diff-QWVyaWFsL1NvdXJjZS9Db250cm9sbGVycy9QcmVmZXJlbmNlc1dpbmRvd0NvbnRyb2xsZXIuc3dpZnQ=) | `10.78% <22.22%> (+0.28%)` | :white_check_mark: |\n| [Aerial/Source/Controllers/Preferences.swift](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/compare/d73333d52ccef5f68121dd342ff1c53f59401a94...295f31241c72be10a2fa61e5b6c6a725f5843f7e?src=pr&el=tree#diff-QWVyaWFsL1NvdXJjZS9Db250cm9sbGVycy9QcmVmZXJlbmNlcy5zd2lmdA==) | `61.19% <50%> (-1.11%)` | :x: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/317?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `\u0394 = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `\u00f8 = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/317?src=pr&el=footer).

What city was it showing etc?    All of a sudden about a week or 2 ago the videos stopped showing and I got a broken play icon. I thought it was just an auto update issue, so I thought I would try and wait it out. Well then never came back, so today I went to the settings and at first it showed all the checkboxes of the videos, but none of them showed the preview. So I tried toggling to a different screen saver and go back. Now all of the video checkboxes are gone.

I have loaded the aerial screensaver on 2 systems running 10.11.6 (15G1212). The screensaver starts, but then the movement \"freezes\" after 2 secs. I am using the latest version.

But it was the same I had.\r\nI never shut up the computer\u2026 now, using Aerials, I have to turn off, because let the mac work all night is wasting energy and processor.\r\nI don`t want to remove Aerials so the thing is that I still waiting for more answers.\r\nI`m with the last version of Aerials\r\nAgain, Tkx for the help\r\nJPVeiga Well great news. I installed the latest version and then uninstalled it and my Mac has no problems anymore. Very strange. Thanks again and great job with the screen saver. Hi John, tkx again - no, my Mac is all in one - 21.5\u201d \r\nWell I like to try to uninstall - but I don`t know how - the app are not in the app launchpad.\r\nwhat you think I have to do?\r\nTkx \r\nJP ```\r\n2017-01-11 22:37:13 -0500 \r\nAssertion status system-wide:\r\n   BackgroundTask                 0\r\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\r\n   UserIsActive                   1\r\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\r\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\r\n   ExternalMedia                  1\r\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0\r\n   NetworkClientActive            0\r\nListed by owning process:\r\n   pid 49(powerd): [0x0000000600088000] 11:02:06 ExternalMedia named: \"com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted\" \r\n   pid 100(hidd): [0x00004ec20009892a] 00:25:13 UserIsActive named: \"com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle.4294968170.11\" \r\n\tTimeout will fire in 1796 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease\r\nKernel Assertions: 0x104=USB,MAGICWAKE\r\n   id=503  level=255 0x4=USB mod=12/31/69, 7:00 PM description=com.apple.usb.externaldevice.14400000 owner=Ultra Fit\r\n   id=506  level=255 0x100=MAGICWAKE mod=1/11/17, 10:44 PM description=en0 owner=en0\r\nIdle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler\r\n``` sorry the delay - I had my site hacked and my computer was on quarantine for precaution\r\nI got to have answers as soon as I get my Mac back!\r\ntkx\r\njp  A black bar across the bottom subtly displaying the location of the video would be very cool!  Perhaps in the Options panel, add come credits and also the version number. Need version number to verify which version I'm running or if it's even a beta version (see some bug reports asking for version number) +1 I downloaded v 1.4 and I can tell it is with the new features. But it says 1.2 in the bottom right.\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-11 at 12 40 11 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40175/46819880-d6d38980-cd52-11e8-95a7-0fc2272c4765.png)\r\n Yep you're right. I went back to look just now, since closing Prefs earlier. I see \"1.4\".  The cache goes and sites in C drive which is already cramped. I want to place the videos some other partition and route the videos to the screensaver. Is this possible?  I love this screensaver, thanks for putting it together! Since so many of the locations are places I haven't seen and don't recognize, it would be cool if, overlayed on the video somewhere, text would display the location of that video. It could be small and out of the way, like lower left corner or something, so as not to take away from the awesomeness of the videos. Thanks for considering!  Hi,\r\n1) Cache size information: It would be a nice addition if the the cache size was displayed somewhere in the setting pane as it can become quite large.\r\n2) Purge cache: A purge cache button is **essential** as more and more video are added and apple still use very small for their entry level machine.\r\n3) Limit cache option: In the same order of idea, it would be interesting to have an option to limit the cache size. As older video get deleted from the cache, it would make the app display the newer video that are not cached yet.  The Aerial.saver package is not from an 'Identified Developer'. \r\n\r\nUsers often use machines from employers that only allow the installation of apps from Identified Developers. \r\n\r\nCan the package be updated with an Identified Developer easily without issues or lots of work? @SullMcIntyre Info on the general process is [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/how-it-works/).\r\n\r\nI found this information on [code-signing for teams](https://codesigning.guide/) but it's entirely up to the core team if this is a direction they want to go in.\r\n\r\n> TL;DR : You can fork and use your own license but be respectful of the core team's wishes.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would imagine that this would be a pretty big headache for relatively low return. With that said you could always fork the project, get your own developer ID through Apple, and add your key to your fork. But of course in that scenario I would hope that you would make a very clear distinction between your fork and the original and not make any claims or representations about the original material that would go against @JohnCoates ' license or the entire team's work. You could always maintain it as a private repo.\r\n\r\nAlso please note that I'm not on the team and I have no legal training so if you are interested in the suggestion above you'll be responsible for your own due diligence.  Hi, amazing ScreenSaver, but I have noticed that the screenSaver does not comply with the Energy Saver presets. If the ScreenSaver is running and a preset to put the display to sleep is set for a given period of time, the display will never go to sleep. Hope you can fix this...\r\n Evidently not.. ;-) \nThanks. just downloaded the latest version, I was running a Beta. \nThe download locations in GitHub are a little convoluted.\nJC\n\n> On Dec 29, 2016, at 11:13, Alistair McMillan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> There was a bug with this a while ago, but John fixed it.\n> \n> Are you running the current version? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/296#issuecomment-269643732>, or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AXrY8C6X_Ep-FwABPwBPqixrM-HXC36Mks5rM84kgaJpZM4LXpKG>.\n> \n\n Everything working OK now...  John,\r\n\r\n  Will you be writing this screen saver for the Linux community also? I would love to have something like this on my Linux boxes.  Put iMac into Screensaver mode using Hot Corners. When I came back to my machine a few hours later it was a sleep with the display blacked out, as I expected. When I attempted to wake the machine I saw the Aerial screensaver start, and it never stopped or would be interrupted by the keyboard or trackpad. I've been using the stock screen savers for 8 months and never had an issue.  Started using the Aerial screensaver today and it locked the first time I used it.   With all due respect, the fact that caching occurs via the screen saver I am skeptical that the ONLY way this  can hang is the OS.\r\n\r\n I'm sorry I removed the screensaver from my machine. I looked before removing it and the operating system didn't seem to record anything.  Sorry to leave you hanging, I just don't have the time to go through troubleshooting it with you.  Screensaver not compatible with macOs 10.12 Sierra Thank you very much solved  I installed the Aerial screensaver on my iMac running El Capitan by following the instructions at https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial. Upon activation, the screensaver displays the message, \"You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X.

Be great to have this in the main version @kevinawoo's fork worked on my machine. \r\n\r\nBecause Aerial.saver was correctly compiled.\r\n@ohayon's fork did not work for my machine. \r\nIf the code were updated id give it a thumbsup!\r\nBut I don't have any authority. Just another programmer saying thanks. \r\n@ohayon @kevinawoo @alistairmcmillan  I made a forked release for those that can't or are too lazy to compile it.\r\nhttps://github.com/kevinawoo/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.3-location-lables\r\n\r\nYou can download it here https://github.com/kevinawoo/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3-location-lables/Aerial.v1.3-location-labels.zip @kevinawoo, nice. If you want to see the label with aerial on your desktop;\r\nI added the Aerial.saver with the label fix into my Aerial_Desktop application. \r\nhttps://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/aerial_desktop In case you guys want to quickly update your code. Not sure how it behaves when you are trying to make a new .saver because I have not looked at the code but the current @kevinawoo's Aerial.saver will remain working when you update the fork.\r\n@kevinawoo @ohayon \r\n```git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git;\r\ngit pull upstream master;\r\ngit rebase upstream/master;\r\ngit push -f origin master;``` @ohayon, so I thought that I would have to increase label size for my grandma who has macular degeneration. Right away she whipped out \"magnifying glass\" on her iPhone. \ud83d\ude02  \r\n\r\nShe preferred the label at that size because it did not take away from the content and only needed to look up the location label when unaware what location she was viewing.\r\nSo far I have gotten six people to download @kevinawoo's Aerial.saver all reviews have been positive about label size. \ud83d\udcaf  @JohnCoates Any thoughts on this? It seems like a great feature. Feel free to install from my fork here: https://github.com/ohayon/Aerial. I can also build a release so it's easier if that's helpful. \ud83d\ude80  @ohayon any chance your fork is brew installable? Hey @travi - it isnt currently, but I can make that happen for sure! that would be huge. the ease of installing the old version with brew is the whole reason i don't yet use your fork. @ohayon, @kevinawoo \r\nYou can script location labels to be enabled by default in bash.\r\n## Read some screensaver information information.\r\nbottom of the result had the key of interest \ud83d\ude0b\r\n```bash \r\ndefaults -currentHost read com.JohnCoates.Aerial\r\nshouldShowNameLabel = 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## turn labels on:\r\n```bash\r\ndefaults -currentHost write com.JohnCoates.Aerial shouldShowNameLabel 1\r\n```\r\n## turn labels off:\r\n```bash\r\ndefaults -currentHost write com.JohnCoates.Aerial shouldShowNameLabel 0\r\n```  When I've tried loading the Ariel screensaver on my iMac and MacBook, no images load as screen saver or in preview. They had worked previously, but will no longer load. Same issue here; presenting first frame of the video, like it's a static image instead of a video. Running 1.2, reset the cache and downloaded all content. No proxy or firewall. Yep, confirmed that I'm using 1.2 and all videos are cached. I deleted them and re-downloaded them a couple days ago just to make sure cache wasn't corrupt, to no avail. Yes, same issue on MacOS Sierra 10.12. I'm having this issue on macOS Sierra 10.12.2\r\n\r\nI tried downloading `v1.2` and `v1.2 beta 5`\r\n\r\nEdit: This might belong in another issue; My screensaver is saying \r\n> You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of macOS. Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\r\n\r\nEdit...: I checked #269 and the screen saver works, but the preview and options for the screen saver did not work. After launching the screen saver (with Alfred) a couple of times, I went back into settings and everything was working as expected. Strange bug.   I suggets including a feature that would choose the screensaver depending on the time. So, after sunrise, it will choose screensaver that are shot during the day, at night, ones shot a night, at sunset, shot sunset, etc.   Hi John,\r\nMay I know if the new screen savers from the Apple TV which debuted a fews days ago will be included in Aerial real soon? \ud83d\ude04\r\nThanks!

Only the first image of the video is shown on the screensaver, but there's no playback at all for new videos. Old videos do play correctly. All videos are correctly cached. \r\n\r\nWhen previewing using the button in the setting panel, new videos play normally.  No issues here, they work fine for me. Are you running the latest version? You could try resetting your cache settings and/or Download and cache all videos?\r\n\r\n![pasted_image_20_12_16_08_57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1049693/21342479/6dd9971c-c692-11e6-9a03-1f6096a5cd56.jpg) I've done all that. Running latest version. Now it seems to only halt playback with one video from Dubai day, though I've tried to clear cache multiple times.  Most likely a bandwidth issue. On one network (work) I had less than 5Mbps bandwidth and experienced the same thing you did on all videos that were not cached. However, at Starbucks all videos played fine, even those not cached. So it seems that the playback needs a higher bandwidth to keep the videos going. I have the same issue, I thought it was fixed but vids seem to freeze randomly. I have latest version (tried re-installing and re-caching vids but nothing). Thank you all. @alistairmcmillan That one among others. \r\n\r\nAs @Syden10 says, it seems to freeze randomly. (I also have the last version, and videos are all cached and play fine when played from the Finder).\r\n Same here, it's random but indeed with the newer files. Using latest version and everything cached. Sometins it freezes at the start and sometimes in the middle. So that would mean the following 450Mb+ videos would be problematic:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/Library/Caches/Aerial $ find . -type f -size +450M\r\n./comp_HK_H004_C008_v10_6Mbps.mov\r\n./comp_HK_H004_C013_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov\r\n./comp_LA_A008_C004_ALT_v33_6Mbps.mov\r\n~/Library/Caches/Aerial $ \r\n```\r\n\r\nHave you tried playing those cached video files in quicktime? Do they play fine in there or do they stutter as well?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ open ~/Library/Caches/Aerial/comp_HK_H004_C008_v10_6Mbps.mov\r\n``` \r\n\r\nMight it be hardware related? Do you only experience it in a multi-screen setup or also in a single screen setup? What kind of machine do you have?\r\n\r\n_No issues here on my Mid 2015 15\" Retina MacBook Pro (2.5Ghz Intel Core i7 with Intel Iris Pro GPU) on 3 displays (internal, external HDMI and external display port running mac OS 10.11.6 El Capitan._ To anybody who is experiencing issues ;) Here they all seem to play fine through quicktime, although I do recognize some of them for being frozen previously, even though a second try seems to play them fine as well until some other gets stuck. Machine is late 2011 13\" MBP (crappy intel HD 3000 - topped to 512), freezes happen both with external or native screen only. Thanks for your time. Same issue here. Old videos work fine. New ones are frozen. Late 27-inch iMac, 3.2 GHz Intel Core i5, 24 GB Ram, running the videos cached. have also this freezing issue of the new videos on my mid 2012 macbook, and on my Mac mini too Videos are freezing for me as well. I'm using a 2015 15'' MacBook Pro. I appreciate the OP bring up this issue... really hoping for a solution. Same here, freezing sometimes @ MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) / 2,5 GHz Intel Core i7 / 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 / NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB. I have the same problem.

I have seen freezes in both single screen (main laptop screen) and in my three screen setup (more noticeable in the three screen setup cos I run three different videos so higher chance of occurring).\r\n The videos are freezing me for as well. First time installation, videos are cached. I hope this can be resolved. Would be great to use the program. I wonder if this could be related to _macOS Sierra_?

Great news! seems fixed after 10.12.4 update, at least on my end. Thanks to all, regards. So far so good for me too. \ud83d\ude0a  Just updated to 10.12.4 and reenabled all the videos in the Screen Saver options and haven't had a freeze since.  \ud83d\udc4d  Still freezing here. Los Angeles Day 3 froze after I re-enabled it. I had previously disabled everything except Iceland to keep it from freezing. Sierra 10.12.4, dual monitors on 2015MBP, display different on each monitor option.\r\n\r\nALL videos are only every showing the first frame only. Resetting caches not a fix. Resetting in a fast-internet area and re-downloading videos not a fix. Setting same on each display not a fix. Disabling \"cache videos as they play\" not a fix.\r\n\r\nSeems to be worse SINCE upgrading to 10.12.4, in opposition to previous comments...\r\n\r\n I noticed that this only happens when enabling local caching for videos. When I turn cache off, I don't see the freezing. I'm updated to the latest version. I run my iMac overnight for backup. Morning is when I find frozen screen savers. I disabled each one that froze and found them to be: Hong Kong Day one and three, and Los Angeles Day three. I also disabled all of Dubai and Liwa, because I couldn't care less about those places. Works fine now. Yeah, spoke too soon.  I noticed a couple of freezes over the past week.  I'd rather not to have to turn the cache off though as downloading each video repeatedly doesn't seem to be very efficient. Having the same issues as others in this thread but i have noticed one thing.\r\nI have a Macbook Pro and if i unplug the power and run it on battery the screensaver has not frozen.\r\nI have tested twice with about 50 min screenssaver run.\r\nOnce i plug in power it will freeze randomly after 10 min or so.\r\nAnyone seen this?\r\n\r\nOn my iMac it never freeze.\r\n\r\nI use MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with macOS 10.12.2 I had uninstalled the screensaver because using it conflicted with my VNC software and made it difficult to get to my desktop. This was the vault of the VNC vendor, as I found that most every screensaver created a conflict. So I changed to another remote app. When I reinstalled the screensaver and enabled caching, I could see the screensavers downloading individually, each with a progress bar. This isn\u2019t something I remember seeing in my initial install. All the videos are working now.  Upgraded today to macOS 10.12.6 and screen saver been running without freeze for several hours. I thought the problem was gone until I noticed that one of my videos was frozen yesterday.  10.12.6 seems to be much better for me too, haven't seen the freeze (particularly multi monitor) for a while now.  Apple has released 21 new screen savers for the Apple TV, it'd be great to see these flow into a new version of Arial.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work! Most of our office has this screen saver running and we all find it very soothing.\r\n\r\n[http://www.macrumors.com/2016/12/16/apple-tv-new-aerial-screen-savers/](url) Ha, just came here to say same:\r\n\r\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2016/12/16/apple-updates-apple-tv-aerial-screensaver-with-new-hd-videos-featuring-dubai-greenland-los-angeles-and-more/ I don't know what triggers it to pull the new ones. But I still only have China, Hawaii, London, New York City, and San Francisco. fwiw, I have the new ones listed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"620\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-16 at 1 38 43 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2723/21279419/f98e21ac-c394-11e6-95e2-261adac41d51.png\">\r\n\r\nI didn't do anything other than open up the screen saver preferences (although they were already there waiting for me). If you don't have them yet, I'm assuming it's probably a caching thing, and you'll get them as Apple's CDN updates over the next few hours. @alistairmcmillan Thanks. Looks like I didn't have the newest version. Mine we're in the list but not working. Reinstalling the screensaver worked though (this time via brew) i didn't have to do anything - the new screensavers just displayed :-)\n\nOn Sun, Dec 18, 2016 at 10:46 PM, Alistair McMillan <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Closing as duplicate of #276\n> <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/276>.\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/277#issuecomment-267812090>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABdq8ZCakA2kLOhrhlvqGykZqsIEeqXKks5rJQDcgaJpZM4LPloA>\n> .\n>\n  Apple has added 21 more video/locations to Apple TV. \r\n\r\nLocations of new video sources here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/12/16/apple-tvs-gorgeous-aerial-screen-saver-gains-21-new-videos-watch-them-all-right-here/ Wow! Did not realize. Yes, I can confirm that the new locations get picked up automatically. Thanks! Why is this still open? Fair enough   The videos appear to be low res and don't look nearly as good as they do on my AppleTV/TV combo at home https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B50igKAfYyPCcDdQV25yc21sQzQ\r\nThese are the hi-res versions of the videos. Download them and place them in the Aerial cache folder\r\n\r\nThe original post - https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/257\r\n Also, see that the result of the discussion on Issue #257 (the one where Cristian provides the link to the enhanced videos) is that the improvement will be done programatically via OpenGL/Metal filtering, so that battery impact is small, and no additional downloads are required.  hey, \r\n\r\nAbout every 10 days the cached videos folder gets reset and I have to download all the videos again.  Is this due to the autoload by Apple?\r\n\r\n-S I completely forgot that I have cleanmymac scheduled to run once a week. It clears all the cache files which includes the videos.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help   Hey, \r\n\r\nthe clock is not aligned by center on 15' MacBook, it is shifted to the left a bit. Seems like currently the clock position is calculated based on the resolution of 13' MacBook (maybe there is some hardcode here instead of fair calculations?). \r\n\r\n  I noticed over the past few days the screensaver has been freezing, so I updated to 1.2 Beta 5 and now it works. Except when I try to open the screensaver options, System Preferences freezes. Happens every time I try to open the options panel.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674092/20985224/6aab2340-bc78-11e6-8045-f735a77c9683.png)\r\n No I don\u2019t, and I\u2019ve tried it on multiple networks; still crashing consistently. I have the same issue. Yeah I'm able to view that Strange, I'm no longer getting the freezing issue. Not sure when it resolved though I am also able to view that. \r\nI am also no longer getting this issue, though I'm not sure when it was resolved? Yeah, I think it can close. One of those annoying self-resolving mystery bugs\u2026  I have noticed over the past couple of months that my Mac, which I don't touch often but leave on, showed tens to hundred of times more \"Data Received\" than Data Sent in Activity monitor. \r\n\r\nI could not figure out what it was until I used the little snitch app, which showed a large amount of data usage from my screen-saver after sleeping for a few hours. \r\n\r\nI open this issue to ask that you please make it more known that this application **Streams** the screen savers, and doesn't store them locally.\r\n\r\nI've been hunting the issue for months and am disappointed to see that this beautiful app here is the problem.\r\n\r\nThank you. This started happening for me as well. Thing goes crazy to 7GB and more. The beta needs to become the main version ASAP. They've just released a whole new set of videos. It's been linked as the main version for a while from the Readme https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial\r\n\r\nEdit: I've labeled it as final now  Thought it would be neat to have this avail on Windows. Seems possible, just curious if you been asked. Nice work! I love this on my macs family. \ud83d\udc4d   Just says it doesn't work with this version of macOS and to check with you to get a new one :( seems to be working for me fine.\n It's definitely not only affecting the preview. It doesn't work when the screensaver comes up. I reinstalled it and it's still not working.\n That error message pops up on the full screen, with system clock after inactivity and/or by using a hot corner.\n No, I don't have anything of the sort. In fact I never used screen savers at all before I found out about this project. I just restored my hard drive through Migration assistant though.\n https://i.imgur.com/HooNUOp.jpg\n I'm facing the same issue. Did you manage to resolve it? @alistairmcmillan Cool.. that resolved it. thanks. Had this issue, and doing what was suggested above fixed it for me. Yep, the fix was to close and reopen the System Preferences window. :) Lovely screensaver, thank you!  Have tried closing and reopening SysPrefs, rebooting, deleting and reinstalling. Still get the message.\r\n\r\nOSX 10.12.2 (was happening on 10.12.1 as well), XCode 8.2.1. Happy to provide any further debug information you might need. Yes. I am seeing this as well, on a mid 2011 imac, running SIerra 10.12.2\r\nPer above instructions.\r\n\r\ncwd\r\n/\r\ntxt\r\n/Applications/System Preferences.app/Contents/MacOS/System

aerial.saver in both /Library/Screen Savers, and in /Users/peter/Library/Screen Savers/ - deleted both, and reinstalled with homebrew - seems to work OK now.  \r\nin case it helps, for me, I had to overlay the brew-installed version with the downloaded version in ~/Library/Screen Savers, then in the Preferences pane switch from Aerial to another, and then back.  Not sure what of all that actually made things work, but it works now... That did not work for me.  I uninstalled, restarted, installed using brew, went to preferences, selected aerial, closed preferences, reopened preferences, it still did not work.  i restarted computer, opened preferences, still not working.  Then I installed from download over top of brew install in ~/Library/Screen Savers.  No dice.  I switched to some other screen saver, then back, no restarting preferences, and it started working.  So, just stopping and restarting preferences did not work for me.  I am not sure if it was that the brew version was corrupted and the downloaded one was not, or the switch to another and back, but either one or both of those steps in addition were needed to get it working for me (10.12.2 on 2013 Mac mini). I was having this issue and it went away after launching the screen saver a couple times (with Alfred). \r\n\r\nThese are the steps I went through:\r\n1. Select Aerial Screensaver\r\n2. Close settings\r\n3. Launch screen saver (with something life alfred, hot corners, or set your screen saver timer to a minute...)\r\n4. Repeat step 3 a couple of times\r\n5. Go back to settings and check if your computer is on fire (screen saver options and preview should work...?)  the first two data badges of README.md (via shields.io) not working. Page not Found after clicking on them  Awesome screensaver.  I just have the issue of noticing excessive downloading of content or something when the screensaver is running.  It runs into the 100's of MB each time it runs.  I've had to disable it just to save my data plan.  Isn't it possible to download all content and keep it locally rather than downloading something at each time the screensaver runs?\n\nPlease advise,\n\nAfricanTechie\n Thanks, let me give it a shot ASAP.  \n Superb - all done and working like a charm without additional downloads while running...  Thank you very much for the prompt response and solution.\n  The screensaver no longer works after upgrading.  Is there a new release on the way that is Sierra compatible?\n  It would be nice to have the option to use scale to fit rather than scale to fill for vertical displays. The screen savers look quite pixelated when stretched vertically by 2x or more.\n\nThanks for the hard work!\n I also use portrait displays, so anything around better support for them is always a gift. I also use vertical displays, but find that scale to fill helps with bringing the focus. The screensaver activates when I'm away, so I like to find the screen full with the video, not so much the resolution. \r\n\r\nAlso, by getting the videos from Apple, we can get better versions if they ever provide better versions \u20144K content, for instance, for a next-generation AppleTV\u2014, and I'm wary of using different sources.\r\n\r\nLong story short, if you implement this, please make it a preference.  First of all, I love the project. I think it's a great screensaver. This isn't a complaint but an idea for a feature. It would be cool if the ariel views synced with our local time. So if it's day time, a day view would play and if it's night time, a night view would play. There are even a few ariels that seem to be morning or dusk that could fit in those times. The reason why I think it would good is so our eyes won't be strained from the sudden change in brightness (mostly at night). I use Flux to change the screen color as it gets later into the night and sometimes it can be jarring when a bright webpage/window pops up. Either way, it's a great screensaver and I look forward to using it more and more.\n  I have really enjoyed the Aerial screen saver.  I hope you update it so it can be used with Sierra.\n\nArthur Gooding\n Aerial on Sierra works fine for me.\n it works eventually but produces crash error during installation.\n its on the hackintosh. I installed Sierra yesterday using clover and looks good and stable - it used to run Yosemite flawlessly for the past two years+. (240GB SSD, Core2Duo E7600, 460GTX, nvidia web drivers, 8GB ram). \n\non topic:\nI just tried installing Aerial again on top of the existing installation and provide you with the requested screenshot - no errors this time. Maybe the crash-error-message was a hackintosh glitch---\n I think it was maybe System Preferences related due to unrecognised developer or smt. Cant be sure of course just guessing.. Seems nice and stable now.\n I can't make it work, correct install and I see preview, but when the screensaver starts only black screen.\n\nImac 12.1, Sierra clean install\n\n*edit, LittleSnitch was blocking the connection, now it works!\n Just got really excited to use this. Downloaded latest and it just displays an image. The images rotate but the video doesn't seem to play. Sierra 10.12, MacBook Pro. \n\nAt hotel, perhaps not the fastest internet is causing the issue.\n Never mind! Just needed time to load. Really excited to use this. Any chance of doing a Space on like the Apple TV space app?\n Mine isn't working at all. It stays about 30 seconds in a black screen then when the video starts it freezes almost immediately. Same thing happens in the preview.\n @alistairmcmillan 1.2 Beta 5, I deleted the version I was running and installed the lasted yesterday, still doesn't work. Yes, I have tried caching it, but it says \"Connection fail: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1001\" and some other word I can't read.\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"captura de tela 2016-10-06 as 12 07 24\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22651557/19157980/76870c24-8bbd-11e6-84dc-7c2be2235e26.png\">\n @alistairmcmillan Oh I see, I'm actually in my university and here there's a few things blocked, I didn't know this would be blocked. Anyway, I'll have to try caching at home then, see if it works. Thank you for helping.\n  Both in the preview window and the actual screen saver just shows a black screen \n I'm using a VPN which seems to be causing the problem. Installing the beta and downloading the videos seem to have fixed it. Thanks \n  Would be cool if we could set a cutoff for day and night times and have the screensaver only display Night videos past a certain time and Day videos otherwise.\n Duplicate of #11\n  In Settings > Energy Saver, I have my displays set to turn off after a time period. I noticed that my displays will never turn off when I use Aerial as a screensaver.\n I unchecked \"Wake for Wi-Fi network access\", and after a brief test of setting the screensaver to launch after 1 minute, and the display to sleep after 2 minutes, it seems to work. Closing this.\n @alistairmcmillan Great, thanks!\n  It would be awesome if this could also display the time, and while I know OSX offers the option to overlay a clock on top of the screensaver, I always hated how it is placed on a random location over it.\n\nWould you consider including a proper clock on top of this? If so, I'd be happy to help figure out the design.\n  Now that the screensaver is using cached versions of each video, those can be replaced with sharper versions. I have applied a sharpen filter to each video in AE and re-rendered them, which should make these a little better looking on retina displays.\n\nThis is by no means a resolution increase and they still look blurry, but the improvements are noticeable. If anyone wants the videos, download them here: goo.gl/q8lTBN (will take a while to upload)\n\nTo replace the files, just drop these into /Library/Caches/Aerial/\nFile size is almost double, but if you think it's worth it, you are welcome to use these.\n\nHere are two screenshots comparing before and after:\n![01-old](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7927870/18022984/eb6ad328-6beb-11e6-8b5e-1af807b424f7.jpg)\n![01-sharp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7927870/18022987/ebc4da1c-6beb-11e6-8a4a-0e691660416f.jpg)\n![02-old](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7927870/18022985/ebbe5a16-6beb-11e6-9ea1-de15bc0e444e.jpg)\n![02-sharp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7927870/18022986/ebc49ebc-6beb-11e6-8ba6-05374c0f3ba3.jpg)\n Thanks for your effort!\n Thanks for this!\n Thank you!\n Thanks, these are great!\n I have converted 6 people to use this, it is awesome. \n Happy to hear you guys are enjoying these. It's a shame Apple couldn't be bothered to film these at a higher resolution, but in the meantime we have to make do with solutions like these.\n Great work, looks much improved! I wonder if it would be trivial to add a sharpen filter into Aerial using something like https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2\n I made these in AE and I tried to tailor the level of sharpness for each video so that it looks good, but not over the top (these still are low res and there's only so much you can squeeze out of them). So no point in adding the filter on top of the new videos.\n\nIf you meant doing this programatically for all users, instead of using pre-rendered videos, what you'd have to consider are performance issues. Is that processing framework not going to overload most computers and drain the battery if it has to constantly apply sharpening filters to 1080p videos for half an hour straight?\n I was proposing doing it programmatically for all users.\n\nYou pose a good question. As far as battery draining, I believe that users who run Aerial off of battery are in the minority. Even so, I don't think that a sharpening filter written as a GPU shader would actually add any negligible performance issues. If it was written as a CPU routine, I believe your point would be very valid. Either way it would definitely be an optional feature. Just throwing the idea out there since your results look very nice.\n It can't hurt to have it as a toggle. If you do decide to try it out, I'd be happy to look at what values each video needs (since it's just a number in AE and I cannot translate it to whatever GPUImage2 uses).\n Okay I'll definitely pass it by you if I end up coding it. I've been\nrestructuring and cleaning up the code the last few days, it might not hurt\nto add a new feature!\n\nOn Friday, September 23, 2016, Cristian Moisei notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> It can't hurt to have it as a toggle.

I noticed there are lots of unmerged PRs for this project. Last release (beta) was 8 months ago. Is development stalled? Why aren't these PRs getting any attention\n Huh. No idea. I hope not. But I have releases for Swift 2.2 and 3.0 on my fork now if anyone is interested in them.\n Compiling against 3.0 was just a fun project for myself, to learn some of the new syntax. Compiling against 2.2 has a tangible benefit if you have other screen savers that are compiled against 2.2. System Preferences has a weird bug that makes Swift screen savers crash and/or not work if you switch between two compiled against different versions of Swift (something about it trying to load the libraries for the wrong version) and that was happening to me.\n Well\u2026 All of the other Swift screen savers I use have actually been updated to 2.2. It may not benefit everyone if they're using screen savers built with outdated code, but there's certainly no harm in updating to 2.2 and since a lot of other developers seem to be updating their screen savers to the latest versions it's likely to be beneficial to quite a few people (myself included).\n\nAt this point choosing the version to compile against is arbitrary (if compiling against 2.1, what happens to people with screen savers compiled against 2.2, 2.0 or 1.0 even? -- and so on), so I don't think it hurts to update to the latest stable language release.\n  I'm getting the dreaded\n\n> You cannot use the Aerial screen saver with this version of OS X.\n> Please contact the vendor to get a newer version of the screen saver.\n\nI'm not sure what changed; this was literally working this morning and I've not done any OS updates...\n Nevermind! I thought I was up to date, but I'm not.\n Interestingly enough, I hit this very same issue while messing around with starting another screensaver of my own. I wrote my own [Bitcoin Price Screensaver](https://github.com/colindean/BitcoinPriceScreensaver) in Objective-C in 2013 and wanted to do up something else just this past weekend. I don\u2019t think I came across that same article, but another article said something like \u201cif you get the dreaded \u2018ask vendor for a new version\u2019 message, it means you forgot to do <step that embeds swift differently>\u201d. Thanks for the article, though, it was a good read.\n  It seems that this screensaver overwrites the \"Turn display off after:...\" - please can you look into that? At night it is convenient if the display turns off.\n\nThanks for a great product!\n Thanks - yes that did the trick.\n  I haven't looked over your code yet, but it would be cool to have the screensaver only choose night time aerials at say 20:00-05:00 system time and day aerials otherwise.\n    Hi,\n\nI just installed the newest beta and I think the speed of the video is a bit too high. Is there a way to adjust it so it moves a bit slower?\n It seems like J, K, and L (on your keyboard) controls the speed? For me it looks like L will speed it up, K will\u2026 freeze it? And J makes it go backwards? Try playing with those keys when the video is playing.\n Interesting, thanks!\n  Screensaver freezes after few seconds.\n\nOs X El Capitan V 10.11.6 beta\n Hey John,\n\nthanks for your quick reply. \n\nI\u2019m using the 1.2 beta 5, and i\u2019ve cached all the videos.\n\nMight be because I\u2019m using Os X beta 10.11.6\n\n> On 8 Jun 2016, at 2:07 PM, Alistair McMillan notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Which version of Aerial are you using?

OSX 10.11.5, Aerial 1.2 Beta 5. Not seeing any obvious/related errors in Console.\n Yes, have all 34 videos cached. Also, when attempting to preview the screen saver I usually just get a black screen instead of the videos.\n @alistairmcmillan I'm using a 2015 MBP. Confirmed that there's only one copy (`/Users/c/Library/Screen Savers/Aerial.saver`).\n\nStrangely, the issue has resolved itself (wish I could tell you what changed). I won't close the ticket since I'm not the OP, but you can consider my ticket resolved. ;) Thanks for the quick response and the work on this project.\n +1\n\nEnvironment: iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014), macOS 10.11.5\n\nPlay Different Aerial on each display is enabled.\n\nWhen the screen saver starts, the movies are animated for about 20 seconds, then they freeze. Tapping the space bar starts the video on my main screen again (and tapping it again pauses the video once more). Any other key or mouse click exits the screen saver.\n Hi. The screensaver still freezes, whether doing mirroring or separate videos for separate displays. It will start the video and then just freeze the video image. _Sometimes_ the middle display will show the full video for _some_ of the videos but never on either extended displays (which I have 2 other running).\n\nRunning:\niMac (27-inch, Mid 2011)\nOS X El Capitan 10.11.6\n3.1 GHz Intel Core i5\n4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 RAM\nAMD Radeon HD 6970M 1024MB\n And yes, running the v1.2beta5\n worse case scenario is manually delete the folder\n\nxxxx@xxxxMBP /Library/Screen Savers/Default Collections\n\n$ ll\n\ntotal 0\n\ndrwxr-xr-x  19 root  wheel  646  2 Aug  2015 1-National Geographic\n\ndrwxr-xr-x  11 root  wheel  374  2 Aug  2015 2-Aerial\n\ndrwxr-xr-x  11 root  wheel  374  2 Aug  2015 3-Cosmos\n\ndrwxr-xr-x  10 root  wheel  340  2 Aug  2015 4-Nature Patterns\n\nSo in there (insert your user name where xxxx is) and remove 2-Aerial and\ntry again.\n\nTo be honest, apart from the blank black screen ages ago, it;s been solid\non both normal OSX and beta OSX on my Mac Mini.\n\nHappy to take questions.\n you're right - it's where the photos are. hmmm. ok i'll keep checking\n\nOn Wed, Aug 3, 2016 at 3:33 AM, Alistair McMillan notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @moooooooo https://github.com/moooooooo Are you certain that folder has\n> anything to do with this Aerial screensaver?

It seems to run \"sometimes\" but often not, freezing occurs. I have plenty of RAM and HD space so.... I guess this is supposed to work for El Capitan?\n This is happening to me on 10.12 \u2014\u00a0I have all videos cached and it works for a little while, but after the screensaver cycles through several videos it freezes.\n @alistairmcmillan It's a mid 2012 13\" MacBook Air (MacBookAir5,2). Running a single, external display with the laptop closed.\n Here a MBP late 2011, 10.12.2, all video's cached, latest version (1.2). Same issue as @timgonzales \r\nFirst video works fine, once it cycles to the 2nd video, it freezes.\r\n\r\nNo screens attached, just me and mij MBP :)  My screen saver freezes every so often too. They're all cached, latest version (1.2), macOS 10.12.2. **UPDATE 3:** Ok, it definitely appears to be the transition as at least one video that worked before has frozen.  That said, I've never seen either the Hawaii or San Francisco videos freeze.  This is also reproducible across three different macs, one of which is older.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2:** Check that....testing original theory still.  The same screen savers keep freezing...\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**  Ok, this is NOT due to any specific screensaver, but rather the transition from one to another.  The first one always seems to run, but I've had it freeze as quickly as the second one or as slow as several hours later.  I would suggest either having the screensaver log to `/var/log` or something to try and pin this down.  I can say for certain that the old version I was using did not have the freezing problem.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've noticed it's the same screensavers freezing (at least for me).  The two I've noticed so far are:\r\n\r\n* comp_LA_A008_C004_ALT_v33_6Mbps.mov (Los Angeles 3)\r\n* comp_HK_H004_C008_v10_6Mbps.mov (Hong Kong 1)\r\n* comp_DB_D001_C005_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov (Dubai 1)\r\n* plate_G002_C002_BG_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov (Greenland 2)\r\n* comp_HK_H004_C013_t9_6M_HB_tag0.mov (Hong Kong 3)\r\n\r\nI will keep running it to see if there are others, but I've disabled these for now. comp_DB_D001_C005_t9_6M_HB_tag0 freezes here to...\r\n\r\nI've noticed that screensaver on a 2nd screen doesn't freeze, only on my laptop screen. Freezing on transition here as well. As a stop-gap, I have switched over to using Save Hollywood to play the cached movie files as it doesn't freeze and progresses through the various files without issue. I see many commenters reporting the _version_ of Aerial they have installed.  How can I determine the version?\r\n...and yeah I'm having the freezing issue too.  Sometimes only on the secondary display. Just wanted to note that I seemed to have circumvented this bug by deleting all the cached screensavers, and opting to NOT use that option to cache the videos ahead of time. For several weeks now, I have not experienced a screensaver freezing.  Hey, \n\nFirst of all, awesome freakin app you have going here! I am just getting into programming (javascript) and I can't wait until I have the knowledge to design something like this in the future. \n\nQuestion to you, I want to add this Aerial app to the background of my landing page for my final project, any tips or pointers on how to go about doing something like that? My page is bootstrap btw. \n\nA million thanks in advance for your help! \n\n</Cheers!>\n   Maybe you can cut out a new release (_1.2_) and update the cask?\n  First off, great work. This is the best screensaver I've ever seen.\n\nI've cached all videos and sometimes it works fine and the menu is visible. Other times the \"Main\" options menu is missing the list of videos and the preview is black as well as the screensaver failing to display, just black.\n\n![screen shot 2016-05-20 at 10 50 39 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5822866/15437014/834cddf0-1e79-11e6-9a61-56789dc9c2fb.png)\n\nOSX El Cap 10.11.4\n\nI'm happy to do any debugging you need me to to isolate the issue.\n Sorry yes, same issue with beta 5, I've updated the title.\n\nOne bit of additional detail. It appears the 3 pieces of functionality can fail independently, which is making narrowing down a pattern for you more difficult. Just now I had the preview displaying correctly but the settings window was blank, while the screensaver was also black. Early I had the preview and settings blank with a functioning screensaver. Also, I suspected maybe it was a connection issue but I've never been unable to browse directly to the json.\n Sorry just updated the other comment before seeing your question. I am behind a proxy, and suspected that might be the issue but I can hit the json fine. Is there another url I need access to? Is it possible to force offline mode?\n Ok, I've checked the logs and I do get an error when viewing preview.\n\n> Jun  8 12:38:39 WMac System Preferences[3804]: Aerial: Error retrieving content listing.\n\nThen when opening settings I get\n\n> Jun  8 12:38:59 WMac System Preferences[3804]: [12:38:59.881] <<<< AVPlayer >>>> -[AVPlayer outputContext]: No figPlayer found, cannot set picker id\n> Jun  8 12:39:00 WMac System Preferences[3804]: [12:39:00.287] <<<< AVPlayer >>>> -[AVPlayer outputContext]: No figPlayer found, cannot set picker id\n> Jun  8 12:39:00 WMac System Preferences[3804]: [12:39:00.287] <<<< AVPlayer >>>> -[AVPlayer setOutputContext:]: No figPlayer found, cannot set picker id\n\nFinally, while attempting to play screensaver and getting a black screen\n\n> Jun  8 12:41:44 WMac ScreenSaverEngine[3812]: Aerial: Error retrieving content listing.\n\nI'm still able to browse directly to http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json and receive the json\n I think it must be something in my work network that sometimes doesn't allow it or something. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It would be amazing to be able to download everything once, and then have it never try to make any network connections so it would consistently work, but I realize I very well may be the only person with this need. I can live with it working sometimes.\n I've cached everything. That was my assumption as to how it would work as well. I don't know why it ever does not work with everything cached.\n  iMac info:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1229786/15170599/c371073c-1779-11e6-86fb-828e3070b7b7.png)\n @alistairmcmillan  No\uff0cshow below:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1229786/15174340/bb56051a-1793-11e6-9bc7-5b17ec181322.png)\n @alistairmcmillan Thanks, I just click the button below\uff0cit works:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1229786/15183709/dc0e6ab4-17c4-11e6-8a3c-010a79c083a6.png)\n @alistairmcmillan Oh no, only a few can and others are download failed.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1229786/15183949/e2c630de-17c5-11e6-87f0-e2d709bd1f2a.png)\n  Currently when the video switches it jumps to the next one, it would be great it they could fade between each other to make it smoother\n  I'm noticing new aerial videos on my appletv. But they are not listed where I expect them to be : http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\n\nI guess http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json is outdated?\n\nI say this as if I use this screensaver, but actually I have my own script to get videos. I assume both our tools work the same but the list is just not updated. Maybe a new list file with the recent update? Basically I'm wondering if you have any idea where the new videos are coming from.\n\n-Alex TD\n I just noticed some of the new videos as well, glad to see someone has posted about it already.\n No idea what the new URL is. I actually used the Apple TV simulator to get\nthe first one. I don't have an ATV 4\ud83d\ude15\n\nOn Friday, April 8, 2016, broderik notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I just noticed some of the new videos as well, glad to see someone has\n> posted about it already.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/223#issuecomment-207720114\n I don't know any programming but I do have an ATV4 and I'm pretty good at following instructions. Would it be a relatively simple process for me to somehow find out where my ATV is getting the new videos? Some kind of network monitoring utility?\n @broderik You are correct, one could observe network connections of the Apple TV and look for the screensaver downloads.\n I've used [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com) in the past, it should work for this use-case too (it offers a free trial). You basically have to tunnel the TV's networking through your computer by configuring the TV to use your computer as an HTTP proxy. Keep in mind it might not be very straightforward to do - I'm happy to help, but I don't have an Apple TV. The Apple TV also caches the videos, so you might have to force your Apple TV to redownload them by forcing a low disk space scenario or by restoring the Apple TV to factory settings. And once you've found the movie downloads, they should be easy to recognize, assuming they are hosted on [a1.phobos.apple.com](a1.phobos.apple.com) just like the screensaver directory. Make sure you take a couple of screenshots of the request metadata etc, the problem might just be a new parameter. Would be great someone with an Apple TV could do it \ud83d\ude0a\n I would certainly love to help try to capture that info, but I do have a few questions after doing a bit of research on this. The networking settings on the ATV only allow me to change the IP or the DNS (by default they are both \u201cautomatic\u201d). I can probably add a HTTP proxy by creating an Apple Configurator profile and loading it on there. Will that be necessary if I use Charles? I\u2019ve never used that program before so I\u2019m not sure of it\u2019s capabilities.\n Might be easiest to simply sniff the traffic from a mirrored switch port or (if you have a sufficiently capable router) using tcpdump directly from the router.\n\nI have an ATV4 and I can try this later when I get home.\n\nThe only problem is if the ATV downloads via HTTPS then it would be more difficult to intercept.\n @lukehamburg Did you have any time to look at this? Unfortunately I couldn't find any new aerials using the simulator. The same link from above is still embedded in some executables, sadly the simulator doesn't show the aerials, so it's not possible to record the traffic this way.\n I just ran Wireshark on my router and booted up my ATV4.  The only URL I saw containing references to Aerials was that same one: http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json\n\nI will keep investigating.  Not sure where else they could be coming from.\n Maybe the new aerials came included in a software update? Would this be a possibility?\n Can't speak for everyone but I've noticed some new ones appearing at the \"old\" feed.  So I think that's still being updated.  And I ran some packet captures on my network trying to find an alternate address but could not detect one. Thanks @alistairmcmillan \n tvOS 10 has even more new videos. Be good if we can get these included also. \n  Hello! First of all, thank you very much for your work. I'd be awesome to have this screensaver. Unfortunately, the software is telling me that this screensaver cannot work with my OS X version, that is pretty strange, as long as I have El Capitan 10.11.4 (on an iMac mid-2010). Am I doing something wrong? I've already tried the Beta 5, but the problem is not solved.\n\nThank you very much\n\nBye\n\nLorenzo\n Confirmed. I get a Kernel Panic when the screensaver launches on 10.11.4 2015 Macbook Pro Retina.

No issues.\n\n@Ryukashy That message comes up now and again for people and just as mysteriously goes away itself. If you still get it I'd recommend making sure you have Beta 5 installed, making sure you've deleted all other versions (check `/Library/Screen Savers` and `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers` as it can be installed in both) and rebooting just to be sure.\n\n@tjjohnsto While it's not impossible, it's pretty unlikely that a screensaver could cause a kernel panic. From the information you've posted above, you have disabled the rootless feature in El Capitan and turned off KEXT signing. Do you mind if I ask why? Third-party KEXTs are much more likely to cause kernel panics than a screensaver.\n beta 5 is just fine on my 10.11.4 machine, as well.\n Hello, I get a strange issue with your screen saver and 'iOS Saver'.\nI get the error message then a quit system preferences and it work but the other screensaver can not be used. Here is a gif of the issue.\nI've also contacted the iOS saver developper.\n\nI run OS X 10.11.4 on a late 2015 27'' 5K iMac.\n![screen recording 2016-04-02 at 09 35 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7252820/14225114/549e980a-f8b7-11e5-9499-4ccbccb7cb25.gif)\n @iStuffs I don't think the problem is with Aerial or iOS Saver. I've seen this when switching between other screensavers. I think it's a bug in System Preferences. \n @alistairmcmillan Yes, it looks like a System preferences bug. But all the 3rd party screensaver are not impacted (for instance 'Watch OSX' work just fine). If we can see what is in commun between the screensaver involved, we can submit the bug to apple and it could be solved sooner and benefits the user experience of your screensaver.\n Not my screensaver, it's John's screensaver. :)\n\nBut yeah. Would be useful to figure what is triggering this System Preferences bug and report it to Apple.\n This bug has been perplexing me since launching Aerial. It might have to do with Swift? No idea.\n @JohnCoates @alistairmcmillan I'd have to agree with it being a bug with System Preferences. Maybe it doesn't play well with the Swift libraries, but I am not 100% sure on that. I've been trying to replicate the issue for iOS Screen Saver on my machine to no avail. Hopefully Apple patches the problem or another solution is found so I can release an update.\n Dear Alistair,\n    thank you for your help. Now the screensaver is working, probably\nyou're right. It's just a temporary issue. Thank you again.\n\n2016-03-26 12:18 GMT+00:00 Alistair McMillan notifications@github.com:\n\n> I've been running the screensaver on two machines running 10.11.4 now\n> since it was released.

Then when you select another Swift screen saver it tries to use those same libraries again. However if the screen saver was compiled against a different version of the libraries you get the error. If it is compiled against the same version, no error.\n\nTo prove this. Download and install https://github.com/soffes/clock-saver/releases/tag/v0.5.0 and https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5 and try to switch between them in System Preferences. I always get the error. They are compiled against different versions of Swift.\n\nThen download and compile the source for both. Because you are compiling them yourself they'll be compiled against the same version of Swift (and have the same version bundled inside). Install the resulting saver files and try switching between them. It works reliably for me.\n\nI've logged a bug with Apple as rdar://25569037 and you can see it here https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5023195543371776. Hopefully it makes sense. I should have been asleep hours ago.\n\nBTW @Chaser53 The problem doesn't seem to be with your version of the iOS Screensaver (the Quartz Composer file version). The problem @iStuffs seems to be having is with Christian's original Swift version. Note in @iStuffs screencast the screensaver says \"iOS Saver\" whereas when I try yours it is listed as \"iOS Lockscree...\". :)\n  Screen saver is pausing when Mac connected to secondary monitor.\nOne of screen just shows paused video and other keep running normally.\n By default the screensaver streams the videos from Apple's servers. So the videos can be affected by network conditions. With the latest beta you can cache all the videos on your computer and the screensaver will play them from there. Try the latest beta, enable the caching options and see if it plays any better for you. Let us know how you get on.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.2beta5\n I get the same issue. It's really actually paused.  If you click on the screen (escaping out of the password prompt) then press the space bar it resumes.  Maybe it pauses when it reaches the streaming limit.  I'll try out the latest beta thanks!\n Hi, so I downloaded the beta but I am still facing this issue :(\n\nCan you guys confirm if it was resolved for you after downloading the beta?\n It pauses for me even in the preview.\n Hey @alistairmcmillan, I downloaded the latest beta only\n\nFrom your comment on #172.\n\n> Select the Cache pane and tick the \"Cache Aerials As They Play\" box.\n\nThis was checked by default.\n\n> Finally click \"Download Now\"\n\nThis is currently in progress for me, lets hope this will fix it :)\n Hey @alistairmcmillan \r\n\r\nYeah, so it worked for me after I cached all the videos.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help :smile:   there's no optional item for select in screen saver options \n Hi @lorichueng could you give us more information on the problem you are seeing?\n Just cannot work. I am 10.11.4 beta6 , too. \n I redownload the stable version and reinstall. It works fine! Thanks. \n sorry for long time with no reply.\nmaybe it's just the bug on OSX . Now , I upgrade it to 10.11.6 Beta , Aerial works fine \n  I was caching the videos using the new Cache feature in `/release/1.5.beta` went to lunch which eventually let the computer to go to sleep and came back to find an error message which for us devs is ok, but I can see a user going like \"what?\"\n\nHere it is:\n<img width=\"596\" alt=\"screenshot_2_22_16__1_30_pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/694585/13228150/64266208-d968-11e5-9b2e-4b9769392267.png\">\n Totally agree! Thanks for making this issue\n  Aerial screensaver starts but display never turns off even though it is configured to turn off after ~10 mins both in power adapter AND battery mode. Macbook pro mid 2015, OSX 10.11.3. Disconnecting all USB peripherals did not help\n\nideas?\n ok thanks will try\n It wasn't the screen saver fault, I had processes preventing sleep, thanks!\n  I've configured the Aerial screensaver, running, e.g., after 1 minute of inactivity.\nI would also need to trigger the black screen/disk disabling features of OS X (e.g., after 1 hour of inactivity), but I realized that with the last version, the black screen is never triggered, not even after a whole night.\nHow to trigger it, maintaining the Aerial screensaver?\n I was also experiencing this behavior: screensaver starts\u2026\u00a0but then terminally does not power off the display when Energy Saver is set to: 1h. Rather, it kept the display on all night long.\n\nBut after installing 1.2 Beta 5, the display now turns off after an hour of inactivity. I was apparently running v1.1 previously.\n\nThis is on a MacBook Pro, running El Capitan 10.11.3.\n  I'm running the screensaver with 3 displays (laptop + 2 external displays) and I'll often see two of the screens playing the same video. I don't recall seeing the same on all 3.\n\nAnyway, it'd be nice to always have each screen show a unique video.\n I have the same issue. Be great to have this fixed. \n I have the same issue too, would be great if fixed and even better if each screen display a completely  different city\n  I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 (fresh clean installation) on a 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. Everything was fine with Screen Saver preference pane:\n<img width=\"669\" alt=\"screen shot 1\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17095595/12865925/cb26fefa-ccdd-11e5-9050-200d28692ddf.png\">\n\nI've installed Aerial 1.1 and my Screen Saver preference pane got broken:\n\u2022 now it has just 1 column in screen saver chooser menu\n\u2022 screen saver preview area is different size\n\u2022 there're some weird gaps and borders in preview area\n<img width=\"669\" alt=\"screen shot 3\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17095595/12865927/cb5d9ff0-ccdd-11e5-8c45-ec41ee7bb373.png\">\n\nI've tried removing Aerial 1.1 \u2013 no luck, also installing Aerial 1.2\u03b25 didn't help.

Then it switches to 1-column and preview area grows a little.\n\nPlease help me get it back to normal. I just got all my stuff back together after a huge migration so I really don't want to create a new user or do a clean OS X installation. I can provide any logs \n Looks like it prompted a bug in the OS X Preferences panel by chance. I'm not able to reproduce it, and after Aerial has been uninstalled it has no possible effect on that panel. \n\nSorry that your screen savers are in a single column.\n Thanks for responding. I've found [another report](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7038374?start=0&tstart=0) on the the same issue so it appears to be a System Preferences bug indeed. I'd better Google more or ask at MacRumors if anyone has a fix.\n  Hi,\n\nI installed the Aerial screensaver and found a really annoying bug.\n\nIf I select it to be my screensaver it didn't work. When I play it start a black screen. If I try to remove it, the Mac send a file to the Trash and the Aerial stays in the options for screensaver. If I try again it send another file, the names are like this:\nAerial 09-25-05-617.saver\nAerial 09-25-08-138.saver\n\nWhat should I do?\n  After I updated El Capitan with the recent security update a couple days ago, I've noticed my mac waking up to a black screen with movable cursor.\n\nHas anyone experienced this lately? Essentially, my computer stays on all the time but the display goes to sleep after 15mins.\n\nI am using the most recent beta with all the screensavers downloaded.\n  I've been getting tons of these error messages in the Console:\n\n03.02.16 13:29:03,585 ScreenSaverEngine[22225]: [13:29:03.585] FigClientHandledCustomURLProviderSendResponse signalled err=-12663 (kFigHTTPError_ParamErr) (No matching request found) at /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia/CoreMedia-1731.15.33/Prototypes/FigHTTP/FigClientHandledCustomURLProvider.c line 754\n\nFull log here: http://pastebin.com/shN6E2CN\n\nAm I wrong in assuming they are caused by Aerial?\n You're right that it's caused by Aerial.

However, I've found a solution:\n- if the screensaver reports \"please contact the vendor\", leave the screesaver selected and close System Preferences,\n- reboot,\n- check back to Desktop & Screesaver to see if Aerial works. In my case it took 3 reboots.\n  (note: same \"false alarms\" happen for iOS Screensaver, for example)\n No, just a single copy for sure.\nIf I used a hot corner, the effect was just as expected - error message across the screen. Same thing after timeout. However, both methods are working now after reboots.\n The latest iteration of Mac OS X (10.11 El Capitan) sets different permissions on applications based upon whether they are signed my a valid developer and the user has the opportunity to override those permissions in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Allow apps downloaded from. I wonder if something inside of that may be causing the erratic behavior being discussed here;\n\nJust a random thought.\n > Is it all working for you now though? Are you happy to close this issue?\n\nYepp, feel free to close it. It's great!\n  I would love to see if this exists for Linux desktop environments. Or have this ported. It would show great support for the open-source community.\n It would complement beautiful environments like the latest plasma really well!\n  I am currently working on creating my own Manifest and videos for Aerial-like screensavers. Currently to use a custom URL in this, one needs to patch the source and recompile, but it would be tremendous if it simply had a preference for it.\n I would also find this very useful.   I have installed aerial earlier ,it was wonderful ,but now I  want to uninstall it !Delete directly in system preference setting can't work!  it seems that i install it for all users on my mac ! \n  Hi, my screensaver was playing perfectly until this morning.

Was very strange.\nI am all sorted and enjoying my screensaver again.\nIs it possible to set these up with own content?\n thanks, I\u2019d love to keep up to date with developments.\n Got it as you said \"Black screen: Try disabling Little Snitch, or try the latest beta release\" I changed the rule in Little Snitch on \"ScreenSaverEngine\" to allow outgoing TCP on port 80 now working.\n  Hi John,\n\nI'm posting here too just in case if the email doesn't work. As i was saying in the emails. I was hoping you could bring the following features to the future update if possible! \n\n-Fade-in & fade-out between videos\n-Videos played based on time (using GPS for accuracy e.g. sunset moment or night time moment)\n\nI believe the above features would surely bring the experience to another level. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSteven Chen\n  letting you know that screen saver presences is not working inside of system preferences and hope this is resolved.\n Try deleting the old versions and reinstall aerial, it worked for me.\n No problem seemed to be solved \n\nThanks \n\nElliott trester \n\nSent from my iPhone\n\n> On Jan 28, 2016, at 4:50 PM, Alistair McMillan notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @ElliottTrester are you still having a problem with this?

A Restart didn't help.\n\nI'll  run Ariel to see if it starts downloading the videos. \n After running Ariel for 4 hours, it doesn't look like it's cached any video. There aren't any in the Applications folder.\n I was getting connection errors when I tried to \"Download Now\" and the \"Current Video\" progress bar would glitch. Each time I pressed the download button again, but then I un-ticked \"Cache Aerials As They Play\" and pressed the download button. It said connection error again, but I left it with the glitching progress bar, and they're now downloading.\n  Today Aerial took all available disk space. I think that it needs to be an option to limit the cache size.\n It shouldn't use that much. How much space do you think it used on your Mac?\n The cache with the current videos consumes ~4.5GB.\n Do non-selected videos also gets cached? \n I wouldn't think so, but never tested that.\n just wanted to chime in here. not sure if this is the right place, but it seems so. \n\ni'm an IT admin at a tech co, and i noticed one of our engineers was using over 209GB of bandwidth with itunes in 30 days.  over 90GB in a week!  all the traffic came from itunes which was odd as that's not normal at all.  after much debugging, we pinpointed to host  `apple.com.edgesuite.net` which points to akamai CDN, which apple does use. \n\nthis did not explain why this user used so much bandwidth when he streams music from pandora, not itunes. then he told me about this screensaver aerial that he recently starting using..and boom!  found it.  3 monitors, streaming this beautiful HD video every time his computer screensaver starts.  \n\nhas anyone else noticed this extreme bandwidth suck?  209GB in a month is huge and will make you reach data caps with most home ISP plans. he told me the code has been updated to cache the data stream so bandwidth will be less.  has anyone done tests on this?\n\nhighly curious and will be conducted my own tests with the old and new code of aerial.\n @fady try beta version. It has \"cache\" option.\n\n@alistairmcmillan I just have downloaded \"all cache\" (using button \"Download Now\" in screensaver settings), and:\n\n``` bash\nx@x:~/Library/Caches$ du -sh Aerial\n4.5G    Aerial\n```\n\nIt's still OK, as I've selected all available videos, but maybe it could be optimized it in some way? SSD space is still bit pricy, especially in Apple's computers...\n +1 for this.\r\n\r\nMy current cache size for Aerial is 10GB! That's way too much. You can disble some of the aerials to decrease it.\r\n\r\nGood thing would be having an option \"Limit cache size to: nn GB\". Better would be to delete cached MOVs when their corresponding checkbox is deselected in the preference sheet. I ended up disabling  @vit0rg  @WebVeteran - select in system prefs setting first and then deleted accordingly from cache using: http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/000/Features/atv/AutumnResources/videos/entries.json as reference I would also like a `limit cache size to n GB` option! HDD space is a much larger problem for me than bandwidth (no data cap), so would prefer to have all videos enabled and re-download videos every now and then than to occupy a large amount of space.   Hello, I would very much love to have an option to upload a (company) logo in gif/png, then choose in what corner (or center) I'd like to show it and how big it should be shown (adjust with a slider in options?).\n\nThis way I'd love to have your screensaver in company meetings with customers! \n @glouel, this is a good idea if you can pull it off.  ... based on location sunrise and sunset.\n Duplicate of #11 \n   Delete directly in system preference setting.\n - cache folder\n   Hi @coryoso sorry it took so long to look at this. Can you please rebase? @glouel I think by \"More understandable\" he means closed:)   Right clicking on the screen saver and clicking delete did not remove the screen saver for me. This is really needed because I had duplicate arial screen savers and didn't know which one I should delete.\n Good. But should probably update it to also mention the Cache folder. No point keeping 5+GB worth of MOV files if they aren't being used.\n In the location provided I have only symlink to brew files location. Perhaps it would be possible to uninstall directly from homebrew?\n It would work. I'm just pointing out that there's no mention of it in the proposed Uninstall section, and that might lead to removing only the alias.\n  How might I be assured that I will receive notifications of updates for Aerial Screen?\n Atom RSS feed: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases.atom\n  This screen saver works great, but it seems to override my setting in Energy Saver to turn off the monitor after 15 minutes - the screen never turns off.\n\nLate 2012 Mac Mini running 10.11.2 here.\n\nThanks.\n  I can't figure out how to enable this feature.

I'll try it out.\n Yes. Thanks for asking. It is just awesome.\n  This is a great project, but please include an option to just use default speed settings and not have keyboard input (i.e., J/K/L, Space, and arrow keys). I and others use space bar and arrows among other keys to wake our Macs from sleep or screensaver, and having these reserved by the screensaver prevents them from being used to authenticate and resume a session. A simple system preference setting to enable or disable these would be fantastic. Thanks!\n I absolutely agree. I use the spacebar to wake my mac usually and i keep getting flustered and confused when the screensaver just stops instead of waking up my mac\n  Retina MacBook Pro 15\" 2014 running hot under 10.11. \n\nIs there a possibility to reduce quality ?\n :-1: \n Same issue on MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)   I experienced the same issue and this happens even in preview mode\n @markiv @raghvendra-iiita-work Which versions are you running?

John has fixed a number of issues and added a caching feature since the 1.1 release.\n  Not sure what else to say. This seems to work and is just fine in preview mode, but when starting the screen saver via hot corners and with the timer it just shows a black screen. Tried all of the different options for the screensaver independently, so it's definitely not just one city's day or night mode messing it up.\n\nThis is on a 13\" 2013 rMBP.\n Which version are you running? And if you're not running the latest beta could you try it and see if caching the videos helps? :)\n I had the same issue, but installing the latest beta and enabling caching resolved it!\n Same issue for me. Tried the v1.2beta5 with caching on and even downloaded all the videos. Works in preview but black screen otherwise.\n Scratch that. I'm a moron. My hot corner was set to put my display to sleep. Works after I pulled my head out of my backside ;P\n  Have an option to enable the display to slowly reduce the display brightness after a set amount of time to save power\n @glouel this is awesome. I can confirm there are a few options not available. see screenshot. also, the asleep time does not display, and when I 'preview' the screensaver, the brightness adjusts, but then doesn't adjust back. would you like logs?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"621\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-24 at 1 50 21 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22992333/47460724-fa0b2980-d793-11e8-850f-3ede822c5df1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nand P.S..

Thanks for your help and thanks so much for creating this.\n-Running Yosemite 10.10.5, 2012 Mac Mini\n\nRyan\n The screensaver will either be in `/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Screen Savers` or `/Library/Screen Savers`. You can just delete it from there and it'll disappear from System Preferences.\n Please close this issue if you've solved your problem.\n  This can reproduced on a MacBook Pro and a Thunderbolt Display.\n\nOS: 10.11.1\nHardware: Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\n @grabber24 It's the same manufacturer they are both Apple products. It plays on both screens the same picture and it freezes after 1s or so.\n\nMacBook: 2880 x 1800\nThunderbolt: 2560 x 1440\n\nTotal of 8,870,400 pixels\n\nMy guess is it's just pushing too many pixels.\n Which version are you using? The latest beta allows you to download and cache the videos so they play off your hard drive. Otherwise they are streaming from Apple's servers and the performance of the playback is dependent on your network connection and any proxies/etc sitting between you and Apple.\n Your guess isn't right, I drive the screensaver on rMBP and 2 Full HD, at home same setup like you. For testing I added a 4k Screen but even then there was no difference. I play on all devices different spaces and it shows most times different videos.\nPlease check your cached files. Try to play them in a video player. \n That's the point, the user shouldn't have to mess with cache for the .saver to work.\n\nBut yes, I tried it with the last stable and the latest beta. Also cached the videos and it still stalls.\n Do the videos from your cache play in a video player? Does it work without your TB Display?\n @mattmischuk Does it play okay if you just try on the Macbook Pro on its own? Just curious cause I'm pretty sure your Macbook should have no issue drawing to both screens. If it still stalls when it is only playing on your Macbook screen alone then there is something else at play here.\n Yeah, if my second display is not connected it works fine.\n I noticed this issue too, assumed it was a network problem, but all of the videos are now cached and still seeing it stall on a MBP (late 2013) + 2TB. Usually one screen will keep playing while the other two stall or are black (no consistency on which screens though). The videos play just fine when played from Finder.\n\nAlso just tried it with screens disconnected and it stalled once out of a few tries. So I'm guessing this may not be to do with the extra displays, except that they make it easier to see the issue.\n Start it in X-/AppCode and lookup the error message, there should be some errors in the log.\n @glouel Close this it is fixed in 1.4.2  Please make this high-definition (like on the Apple TV)! Right now it looks blurry and not as appealing on the retina MacBook Pro. Other than that, everthing is awesome. Keep up the good work!\n These videos have been encoded by Apple at 1920 x 1080 resolution, 30 frames per second, at constant single digit bitrate (each video is between 3 to almost 8 Mbit/s). That _**is**_ high-definition and is close to the best quality that the Apple TV can display.\n\nUpscaling these videos to fit the native resolution of your MacBook would not provide the same perceived quality as viewing them on a television through Apple TV, so there's nothing that can be done on this end to improve your experience.\n\nGiven:\n1. Providing these videos at larger resolution provides no added value to Apple TV owners because they would have to be downscaled to fit the television's resolution.\n2. Providing these videos at higher bitrates would result in larger file sizes (and hence increased bandwidth usage) with very little, if any, perceivable increase in image quality to Apple TV owners.\n\nTherefore:\nI wouldn't expect Apple to distribute higher quality versions of these videos anytime soon unless they decide to include these videos in a new screensaver for OS X (which would render this project unnecessary).\n\nYou get what you pay for.\n  Getting this error about 30-60 seconds after clicking the \"Download Now\" option under cache settings.\n\nThe error is cut off so I can't see the whole thing. Can't resize the window and can't select the text to copy and past the whole thing.\n Not sure what happened, but I don't understand your replies.\n I'm getting this \"connection-fail-error\" when trying to prefetch the videos (options > cache > download now). But this only happens while behind a firewall. No problems at home.\nAre you behind a firewall, too?\n\nJust a guess: The videos are downloaded from a source that can not be reached through port 80 / 443 and therefore blocked while behind a firewall?\n Yes, I am behind a pfSense firewall at home and work.\n @krohn Do you happen to be running a proxy of any sort on your network? (Squid, Squid3, etc?)\n @jacobgraf \nYes, at work I am behind a Squid and a firewall and a second one and this and that and and... Nearly everything is blocked ;-) Trying to download ends up in an timeout like described by you. \nAt home, I have full access to the internet and the download works just fine.\n\nI'm sure you'll see it in the logs of your pfSense Firewall what exactly is blocked and you should be able to define an exception if you have access to the pfSense configuration. \n\nIf not, a dirty workaround might be: Find someone near you with full access, let him install and download the files. You'll find them in /Library/Caches/Aerial/. Copy them onto your machine and enjoy.\nGood luck!\n I clean installed macOS High Sierra, and was going to re-download the Aerial videos, but it seems I now get this error too. I've tried on WiFi and on Ethernet (granted it's the same network), and turning of macOS's Firewall, but all to no avail. Any advice? @alistairmcmillan Yup, I downloaded v1.2 on High Sierra (had been using that version since its release on El Cap/Sierra previously). It's my home network, and I had previously downloaded the Aerial videos fine. (I guess I should have just backed them all up offline before wiping my Mac, but I figured I would be able to redownload them.) The only other system protection I have is Sophos Home for Mac, though that's always been active on my system previously too. @alistairmcmillan Hmm yeah, both are fine. I just tried again, and Aerial cache started working. (Maybe it's because it's morning now where I am, perhaps the large file sizes triggered a temporary block last night when I was first trying, not sure.)\r\n\r\nCame across a separate issue though, where System Preferences would keep unexpectedly shutting down (i.e. crashing) after the first video was downloaded. I checked out the manifest list .json and manually downloaded the second video to the cache folder, and tried the automatic caching again and it continued. Eventually System Preferences crashed again a few more times, but I just repeated the steps. Managed to finally get all 50 (non-duplicate) videos cached. (Oddly enough, the crashes happened on two Dubai and two Hawaii videos. Who knows.)\r\n\r\nI guess we can close this/my case now. Thanks @alistairmcmillan for your help (and for posting the .json link)!  Is it possible to set it to auto update? or have a button to check update in the settings? That will save the trouble to check the update here\n +1\n\nWould be great! Could get it to check for Video and Screensaver updates at the same time :)\n +1\n\nWill be great!\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1 This feature is ESSENTIAL. I don't want to go check for a new version from time to time...\r\nAny news on it?  Hi there,\n\nI installed Version 1.1 and when I selected Aerial from my Desktop and Screensavers, the preview is black and there were no screensaver options available. I also tried the Beta 5 and it was the same issue. I run OS X El Capitan.

When I use any other screen saver it disappears after 15 minutes, but I cannot find a way to do that with these specific ones. I've tried to change the Energy Saver preferences, but that doesn't work. Any ideas?\n Which version of Aerial are you running?\nAnd OS X version?\n\nI just tried to put my screen to hibernate after 1min, and Aerial stops\n Thanks for responding. I have OS 10.11.1 and I can\u2019t tell what version of Aerial. It doesn\u2019t show up.\n\nOn Nov 7, 2015, at 4:41 PM, Ole-Martin Bratteng notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhich version of Aerial are you running?\nAnd OS X version?\n\nI just tried to put my screen to hibernate after 1min, and Aerial stops\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/150#issuecomment-154760486.\n Can you try to install [1.2 Beta 5](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/download/v1.2beta5/Aerial.zip)\n Thanks again.

In what way is it not working for you?\n Restart my computer. And it's kind work now. \n Hey,\nA small heads up, I'm experiencing some problems on 10.11\nA have iMac 27\" 5K with a secondary monitor (DELL 24\") and after a couple of seconds of screen saver, both screens stuck with the frame of the running screensaver. I think this is a bug on 10.11 because if I run it with no monitors connected it works wonderfully!\n\nHope this will be fixed. Thanks for this awesome screensaver!\n Doesn't work on 10.11.2 beta though\n  I just discovered there are Beta versions that let us cache the videos, so I downloaded the Beta 5 to my machine running Yosemite (10.10.5). Unfortunately, clicking \"Change Cache Location\" doesn't do anything, nor does clicking the displayed path to the cache location (the icons/folder names right above the buttons).\n\nClicking the 'Change Cache Location' button works fine in Beta 4 on another (older) machine, btw.\n\nMy issue might be related to #145 though the user who opened that one wasn't very clear about what their actual issue was.\n Related: the default cache location with this version seems to be `HD/Applications`, which I don't think is suited for downloads like these.\n\nIn the Beta 4 it's `User/Library/Caches/Aerial`, which I find much better (though `User/Library/Application Support/Aerial` might also make sense).\n It was always working for me, I just couldn't change the cache location. I haven't updated the software since, so the situation should be unchanged. Are you asking me to update?\n I had a look, and changing the cache location seems to work now. (:\n\nDunno what went wrong previously, but also don't know which version I currently have installed (there doesn't seem to be a way to check from within the Screensaver? I don't remember where I put the original files). If it's the same version I have no idea how this problem could have changed without me doing anything about it. :P\n\nThe only thing \"off\" I noticed is that the last letter in \"Cache Aerials As They Play\" is cut off, as if there were something wrong with some of the elements in that window.\n\n![screen shot 2016-01-29 at 14 04 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/559572/12676436/8cd57a9c-c692-11e5-9d7a-4c3e71da1d9d.png)\n  You know, like a shortcut to get there.  Or just make the displayed path clickable...\n Pull request https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/pull/153 could give you that function\n  Would be nice and helpful to see the version number in screensaver setting. :+1:  Thx.\n Good idea. :P #128 \n  I can't loading the screensaver without internet connection.\n\nI have installed 1.2 beta 4.\n\nno problem with or without little snitch active or not.\n perfect!!!\n  I downloaded the latest beta 4 version of 1.2 Aerial and installed in my retina Macbook pro with 10.11.1 OS X. But I still have black screen problem, and no continuous playing, no offline mode, no cached file after playing and more. Did I install the right version? I cannot attach the saver file in this issue, please check the compatibility with 10.11.1 or check the version release seed! I really love this set of screensaver and really appreciate the work you have done. I will keep my ones on your project and try my best to help you test the features and suggest new features.\n\nSince I'm not a coding guy so maybe i cannot help you with the coding part, I just want to suggest some features, like one-click caching, sync play along time period, etc..\n\nThank you for bringing the great piece of applet! \n I have cached them manually by the methods from another thread. Thanks for the help and the new release!\n\nBtw how can I install the latest version of the screensaver if you release new features? I just downloaded the new saver file and install it but it appears as a new saver not a replacement in the system preferences. \n  It appears it doesn't allow the display to go into sleep\\standby if the aerial screensaver is active.\n\nExample: In Energy Saver, I have Computer Sleep set to Never and Display Sleep set to 15mins. After 15mins, the screen should go into standby\\black but instead it stays active with the aerial screensaver.\n duplicate.\n  For folks with drones, maybe they can submit PRs of own aerial videos here on GH, and then it gets exposed on the screensaver as selectable option when it calls home to gh-pages.\n\nOnly merged videos are made available to the screensaver.\n +1 for this.\nbeing able to include something like this in a screensaver would be amazing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tmbeLTHC_0 \n YES! The ability to add in a list of Youtube video urls and randomize them would be amazing... There are some killer videos out there that would be great as screensavers.\n Duplicate of #41 \n Ahh. Thank you Alistairmcmillan, but that doesn't have the option for Youtube videos...\n\nso..... Not a duplicate.\n i had the exact same thought last night with the sun youtube video\n +1\n Or just add the ability for the user to add custom videos using a simple interface.\n\nSomething similar to what Satellite Eyes does with custom basemaps\nhttp://satelliteeyes.tomtaylor.co.uk/\n  Any chance we're having Linux support?\n :+1: \n Aerial can already be done in Linux with standard software and a tiny bit of configuration. See this for example: https://gist.github.com/Dhertz/9dd69eaad092d0c0fe96\n :+1: \n  Can you please make this for the Amazon Fire TV? It could be side loaded.\nAerial is already on everything that I own (3 macs and 2 PCs) and that would be the cherry on the icing of the cake that is awesomeness. \nSeriously John, amazing work! So grateful for people like you in my tech life. \n  Running the screen saver seems to keep El Capitan 10.11.1 from sleeping. (At least on my MacBook Pro 13 Early 2015). If I have the \"put display to sleep\" slider set to 1 min, everything works. But even sliding up to 3min seems to disallow sleep. My assumption is that the video files are more than 1 min but less than 3 min in length, so the OS considers it a new operation when the new video starts. (Just my guess)\nI really love this screen saver but it's expensive for the monitor to run all night as happened last night.\n +1\n duplicate of #129 \n dup of #23 BTW\n @tiagratim Which version are you running? Beta 4 should fix this issue.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases \n Is beta 4 new today? I didn't actually notice a beta designation when I downloaded Monday afternoon. Sorry if this duplicated another thread, I'm new to Github. \n\n> On Nov 3, 2015, at 10:12 AM, Alistair McMillan notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @tiagratim Which version are you running?

The macbook's lid is always closed.\n  Currently the video stops playing after some time. So when I leave my desk for a coffee and come back, this awesome screen saver shows a freeze frame, which is a bit sad. It would be super-duper, if the video is started over in a loop (or if it starts playing another video).\n If the videos stop playing it is most likely due to a network glitch as the videos are initially downloaded direct from Apple's servers.\n\nWhich version are you running? With the latest versions the videos are cached, so once they've all played once they'll be playing directly from your machine, until Apple update their source files with new videos.\n I'm already using the version including cache. As far as I can see, videos are only cached, if they could be downloaded completely. After about a minute or two all these videos come to a \"natural end\". :) The screen saver then freezes. I mean, it shows the last frame. My suggestion is to restart the video or play another one. That would be great.\n Having the same issue, the beta seems to play around 2 or 3 different scenes then freezes a couple of seconds after starting the next scene.\n From what I have seen (I am not a dev) if a network error occurs scenes will freeze and not restart.\n\nCould this be because Aerial is not trying to reconnect after a dropout?\n So what happens normally, if the end of a video is reached? Or what SHOULD happen? :)\n\nCan you confirm, that the video normally starts over again or another video is started automatically? As far as I can see, I have no network issue, that occurs DURING the playback of a video (since I cached almost all videos when I was not behind a proxy).\n It should keep playing different scenes continuously. \n plays here 2 sec, then freezes (10.11).\ndownloading the videofiles and placing in ~/Library/Caches/Aerial helps.\nsee #136 \n  Energy Saver settings on screen sleep and computer sleep are ignored.\n dup #129 \n see #23 \n @IndigoHomme Which version are you running? Beta 4 should fix this issue.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases \n  After downloading the new beta version I ended up with two icons (and instances apparently) of Aerial in the screen saver chooser menu. \n\nAlthough right clicking on either one presents a \"delete\" and move to trash option, neither one actually works, so there is no way to clean up the menu and leave only the most recent app version. \n\nRunning Yosemite 10.10.5 on MacBook Air Core i7\n Two files. One is called Aerial and the other called Aerial 3 due to the duplicate download of the same title. I didn't override the default file title it created when I downloaded the beta version.\n Awesome. Thanks. Killer job on this. \n I have the same issue but how can I remove them? If I right click and choose Delete Aerial and choose \"Move to Trash\" nothing happens?\n\nI have tried restarting too.\n @chrislowthian If you chose to \"Install for all users\" when you first set up Aerial, then you'll need to manually remove the old version from `/Library/Screen Savers/` (note, that's the Library at the root level of your drive, not the one in your home folder). This appears to be a bug in the System Preferences app \u2013 it won't delete Screen Savers that are installed for all users.\n @beornlake Thank you that worked perfect, much appreciated!\n  Hey - awesome screensaver.  But I noticed when I installed on my El Capitan system that the Energy Saver doesn't kick in to turn off the monitor when this screensaver runs.  I have the saver to run after 5min of inactivity, then for the monitor to kick off after 15min.  This doesn't seem to work w/ this screensaver.  \n @sethjustin Which version are you running? Beta 4 should fix this issue.\n\nhttps://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases \n I have the same issue and have beta 4. Didn't fix it for my early 2015 MBPretina. \n Yep.  I have the Beta 4 release.  :/\n this is an issue for me on Sierra. my monitor ends up staying on all night long now.\n @alistairmcmillan I did as you said, set my display to turn off in 1 min, activated the screen saver from a hot corner, waited over a minute, display never turned off. \n  To make it easier to catch problems caused by people running older\nversions.\n\nUsing the CFBundleVersion number to indicate 1.2 beta 5, based on the answers here http://stackoverflow.com/q/19726988/35794 and Apple's documentation here https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001431-102364\n r03111068981@gmail.com\n +1\n +1\n @JohnCoates - Please merge this!\n    The Check boxes list is missing to select the cities.

When I install and set up the screensaver (and click on the Preview), everything works fine. But when screensaver automatically launches after the set time (1 minute), I can see only black screen, nothing more. I've also downloaded a beta version with offline caching, but results are same.

Upgrading to 1.2beta5 appears to resolve the issue. Thanks!\n  It may be my computer settings, but it looks like since I started using this screensaver, my screen never turns off. I'll sleep all night and wake up to a bright screen with the screensaver up. Can we look into this for saving energy?\n I was just going to report the same! My displays don't sleep anymore either. I've verified that the displays are set to sleep in Energy Saver and they do sleep if I go back to my old screensaver. Thanks!\n  This feature allow screensaver play day videos only during the day (from 6.00 to 20.00) and play night videos only during the night (at other time)\n Awesome @faizrr! That's the first thing I thought when I downloaded this Screensaver. I was thinking \"What if we could set up a preference to make the videos time sensitive...\"\n\nI was planning to do that on the weekend and submit a PR, when I decided to look at the pending ones. \nThankfully someone had already submitted a PR for this.Hope it gets merged. \n Awesome^2!\n Huge +1 on adding this feature. \n A bit more complex but cooler: adding a way to know the day's sunset/sunrise time of the user's place (for example, using external APIs like the [Wolfram Alpha's](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api)). That'd be better than selecting specific hours since countries/seasons have different daylight duration.\n\nAn extra bonus: if the screensaver activates near the sunrise/sunset time, it could show one of the sunsets or sunrises available! But as they are of low duration, maybe it isn't such great idea\u2026 :(\n I didn't know this was already raised as feature suggestion. count me in +1\n\nP.S Flux has a GPS which detects when the sunset happens. Perhaps is something that can be integrated in the software. It doesn't have to be exactly sunset, but perhaps more accurate by differentiating night time or afternoon. It differs as in some areas like Nuno-agostinho has mentioned, winter would go dark much quicker in UK, or if it's cloudy or foggy (more of a weather thing now, but this would hugely depend on the video source available from Apple i guess). This would bring the experience to another level. \n +1\n +1  struck's a lot and does not play most of the time..image is only displayed \nunresponsive in settings panel\n I'm having the same problem... the videos play if I manually activate the screensaver. If I let it activate automatically, the videos don't play. A still image is displayed instead.\n\nUpdate: today I noticed a video was playing on one display but not the other.\n\nI'm running Aerial 1.1 on El Capitan 10.11.1 on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) with a second monitor (Samsung) connected by HDMI\n\nI have \"Play different Aerial on each display\" enabled.\n\nThanks for listening, it's such a great screensaver.!\n Hi there. The same problem happens with my computer, and my low speed internet connexion (2 Mbits/s). A pre-load button could be effectively fine for me. On screensaver start, only fixed image is displayed, like if the video couldn't be downloaded. So, i'm waiting for the next beta release.\n See https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/115 for a possible solution.\n Thanks Meinhard\n\nI\u2019m not running Beta 4 - it doesn\u2019t seem to support the different Aerial on a second display option.\n\n> On 6 Nov 2015, at 11:15 PM, Meinhard Gredig notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> See #115 https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/115 for a possible solution.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/81#issuecomment-154395330.\n @resist888 John hasn't removed that feature.

It'd be great to have a small bit of customized text as an overlay somewhere on the screen.\n John, do u have a roadmap?\n +1 Wow! Better late than never! \ud83d\ude04   Just an enhancement. I noticed a lot of screensavers (specifically OS X defaults ones) you can press the esc key to exit the preferences menu. Just something to make it a little more refined and streamlined. \n Just looked thru other [native] settings and noticed that this is normally the case on screens that have buttons **Cancel** and **OK** (e.g. _Network -> Advanced_)\n\nHowever, Esc doesn't work on screens that only have **Done** button (e.g. _Mission Control -> Hot Corners_).\n\nSo maybe the point of this issue is to change the buttons from \"Done\" to \"Cancel/OK\"\n Great point! I say close this ticket. Won't fix. It is perfectly fine now.\n  Not sure if this is possible, but on portrait orientation displays (screen width is less than screen height) or even any display that doesn't have an aspect ratio that matches the source content it would be nice to have a \"fill screen\" option that scales and crops the video to fit the screen. Current behavior letterboxes (black bars top and bottom) the content and this effect is particularly pronounced on portrait orientation displays.\n Turns out this is just a Mavericks bug. Upgraded to El Cap and everything works as expected.\n  I can see the starting image but there is no movement. It just isn't loading I guess. Please help if there's anything that I can do! This seems really cool!\n @austonib If you\u2019re using an older build, try hitting the spacebar once. Pressing spacebar, J, K, L, or the arrow keys appears to send keyboard input directly to the QuickTime player which can cause Aerial to sit at a still frame. I had this happen accidentally on my own machine. (See issues #21 and #67).\n\nThe newest 1.2b4 release appears to intercept keyboard input, so the above shouldn\u2019t be a problem with the newer versions.\n Awesome thank you! It works now and this is awesome!\n  Since I installed your screen saver on my iMac running el capitan, mac will not sleep. Screensaver runs continuously\n Duplicate of #23 \n  When I activate Aerial via a Hot Corner, it runs for a few seconds and then exits back to the Desktop.\nThis happens on my Late-2013 iMac running OS X 10.11.1 (15B42). My Early-2015 MacBook Pro does not have this problem.\n\nConsole messages (this is from two activations/exits of Aeriel):\n\n```\n10/29/15 4:45:03.540 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.540] <<<< AVPlayer >>>> -[AVPlayer outputContext]: No figPlayer found, cannot set picker id\n10/29/15 4:45:03.540 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.540] <<<< AVPlayer >>>> -[AVPlayer setOutputContext:]: No figPlayer found, cannot set picker id\n10/29/15 4:45:03.645 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.645] FigFileForkOpenMainByCFURL signalled err=35 (errno) (open failed) at /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia_frameworks/CoreMedia-1731.15.20/Sources/Platform/Darwin/DarwinFile.c line 451\n10/29/15 4:45:03.645 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.645] <<<< FigFile >>>> FigFileForkOpenMainByCFURL: opening url \"file:///var/folders/lh/b4g8t0h105n6nppb_1lwrslm0000gn/T//MediaCache/CachedMedia-VgrLZV\", path \"/var/folders/lh/b4g8t0h105n6nppb_1lwrslm0000gn/T//MediaCache/CachedMedia-VgrLZV\" options 0x00000480 failed errno 35 Resource temporarily unavailable\n10/29/15 4:45:03.645 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.645] FigFileForkOpenMainByCFURL signalled err=35 (errno) (open failed) at /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia_frameworks/CoreMedia-1731.15.20/Sources/Platform/Darwin/DarwinFile.c line 451\n10/29/15 4:45:03.645 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.645] <<<< FigFile >>>> FigFileForkOpenMainByCFURL: opening url \"file:///var/folders/lh/b4g8t0h105n6nppb_1lwrslm0000gn/T//MediaCache/CachedMedia-LeKuZQ\", path \"/var/folders/lh/b4g8t0h105n6nppb_1lwrslm0000gn/T//MediaCache/CachedMedia-LeKuZQ\" options 0x00000480 failed errno 35 Resource temporarily unavailable\n10/29/15 4:45:03.645 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.645] FigFileForkOpenMainByCFURL signalled err=35 (errno) (open failed) at /Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/CoreMedia_frameworks/CoreMedia-1731.15.20/Sources/Platform/Darwin/DarwinFile.c line 451\n10/29/15 4:45:03.645 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:03.645] <<<< FigFile >>>> FigFileForkOpenMainByCFURL: opening url \"file:///var/folders/lh/b4g8t0h105n6nppb_1lwrslm0000gn/T//MediaCache/CachedMedia-2kETZX\", path \"/var/folders/lh/b4g8t0h105n6nppb_1lwrslm0000gn/T//MediaCache/CachedMedia-2kETZX\" options 0x00000480 failed errno 35 Resource temporarily unavailable\n10/29/15 4:45:04.451 PM rtcreportingd[7273]: AutoSubmitPreference is 1\n10/29/15 4:45:04.470 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: GVA warning: failed to get a service for display id: 4128828\n10/29/15 4:45:04.475 PM ScreenSaverEngine[24769]: [16:45:04.475] <<<< IQ-CA >>>> piqca_setUsePreQueue: (0x7fbf36003400) rejecting report of layer being serviced -

I was actually just doing some troubleshooting \u2013 my workstation did something else weird this evening, so I rebooted the entire system and Aerial started working just fine. Don\u2019t know if my problem before was a system issue or an Aerial issue. Can\u2019t repro anymore, so maybe close this?\n\n---\n\n_Update:_ Been trying to get the 1.2 beta to work, but I just get a black screen. 1.1 is working just fine right now. Very curious.\n Just tried 1.2b4 and it\u2019s working like a charm.

Makes me wonder if my video hardware is insufficiently study.\n\nThanks, Victor\n I'm not using a hot corner, but I'm having the same issue with the exact same setup. The preview works, but when the screen saver kicks in, I just get a black screen.

I have my display set to sleep after 15 minutes but it will not do this when I run the Aerial screensaver.  I'm running El Cap on an iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011).

Hitting the spacebar will resume the movie.  This is on a mid 2011 iMac with standard BT keyboard and mouse running El Capitan.  Beautiful screen saver but unusable for me in the current state.\n Is this related to #54? I thought it was freezing, but it wasn't. I was pausing it accidentally.\n The problem is it will stop playing after switch `movie` unless you press the `space` key\n +1, same problem here. It plays for about 1-2 seconds then pauses. I have to press spacebar to get the movie to continue playing. Sometimes it plays, pauses, and then plays one more time before pausing indefinitely.\n @alistairmcmillan Nope, not anymore! \n Pausing in Windows version  Dear Sir, I would like an option that display's the title of the screensaver.

I installed your screensaver a few days ago and just love to see the same beautiful videos I already love from my apple tv. But I always found it sad on the Apple TV, that there was no option to have a label, what I was looking at. I really hope you can add this feature for the Mac.\r\nIs there any update? :) +1  Cannot install the developer unregistered error message is given. Latest Safari and system from Apple.\n You have to manually allow the installation. Go to the Security & Privacy section in System Preferences and click the \"Open Anyway\" button and provide admin credentials.\n\nA faster (but less explicit and informative) way avoid this warning is to contol+click on the Aerial.saver file and click \"Open\" in the context menu.

My screensaver is password locked. When I hit the spacebar, assuming that it'll bring up the password box like it does on other screensavers, it instead pauses the video. \n\nMaybe that's a desirable thing for some reason I'm not seeing, but in that case, it would be better as a non-default option users who need it can turn on. \n\nThe space bar, by default, should bring up the password prompt (or exit the screensaver) just as it does for almost all other screensavers.\n Also worth mentioning since the issue is similar: the J, K and L keys manipulate the video too. L speeds it up, J rewinds it, and K pauses it, but doesn't unpause it. Maybe default Quicktime controls?\n\nIn any case, anyone whose password starts with any of these characters is going to get really confused.\n :+1: this is really annoying\n Thanks :D\n Confirmed! Thank you so much, John. This is the best screensaver ever. Everyone who sees it is immediately like, \"Whoa, where did you get that?!\" I tell them, of course.\n AWESOME! +1\n  I am running OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 on a Macbook Air. I have the configuration \"Require password 5 seconds after sleep or screen saver begins\" in the Security & Privacy control panel. However, when using Aerial, this setting does not seem to be honored - whenever I move the mouse to stop the screen saver, NO password is required.\n Duplicate of #33 \n  Whenever you disconnect wifi connection aerial does not longer works\n Duplicate of #43 \n Sorry but I can't find the solution to the problem\n The problem you're having is that the screensaver streams the videos from Apple's servers. It doesn't contain the videos itself. So if you disconnect from the internet then it can't reach the videos. Which is why people are asking John (the developer) to add an \"offline\" mode on that other issue. :)\n @puchysv @alistairmcmillan \n\nI published a basic offline mode version. You can download and have a try. \n\nhttps://github.com/yourtion/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3/Aerial.saver.zip\n  I usually use arrow keys to unlock my Mac, these are quite reachable and I'm sure I won't get any unnecessary symbols in my password field afterwards. However, Aerial seems to go to per-frame mode when I press arrow keys instead of starting the unlock procedure. \nThis issue is not compatible with #21 \n @JohnCoates, thanks!\n  Already mentioned in pervious issues.  Would like to have screen turn off as selected in energy savings settings. Otherwise no issues experienced in El Cap. Great work!\n Duplicate of #23 \n  Could there be any way to store the video files offline?\n\nThis project is absolutely stunning, but for an example here in Australia most of the population is limited to less than 300kb/s (which can't support streaming decent quality video).\n\nCheers!\n YES, please add offline capability for people with slower connections, like me :P\n +1\n Duplicate of #43 \n I already add a basic cache. You can try it on https://github.com/yourtion/Aerial .\n\nTry to download this one https://github.com/yourtion/Aerial/releases/download/v1.2/Aerial.saver.zip\n\n@damian-w @jpshelley @harule \n @yourtion I saw your PR, and I'd recommend following what @JohnCoates mentioned before I test it out.\n :+1: \n :+1: \n I published a basic offline mode version. You can download and have a try. @jpshelley because the bad network and I work offline so the offline mode is needed.\n\nhttps://github.com/yourtion/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3/Aerial.saver.zip\n\n@koengsen @dazorni @damian-w @alistairmcmillan \n Just tested out the new beta @JohnCoates. It is amazing. So much faster. Great work! :tada: \n Thank you :) great stuff\n Thank you kind sir!\n  Installation instructions are a bit confusing, I edited the instruction to be more clear for everyone.\n  I have a late 2008 MacBook Pro running OS X El Capitan 10.11. After downloading Aerial, this is what I have to choose from.\n\n![screen shot 2015-10-28 at 6 41 06 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15360611/10787497/52739dee-7d3f-11e5-948f-d26e082cde12.png)\n Same here. Was working last night when I first installed.\n +1 for the same issue\n +1\n @stan-man did your mac has QuickTime or playable .mov extension?\n :+1: \n\nInstalled it a few days ago, was working fine, today it does not work anymore.\n @stan-man @rikro @katieorenstein @austinfox @pylebecq Which version are you running? Does your version have the cache options in Preferences? https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases\n @alistairmcmillan I'm running version 1.0. I did not see any cache related option in preferences, I only have an option called \"Play a different video on each monitor\" (sorry, might not be the accurate name, I'm translating from french)\n @pylebecq Try the most recent beta. John has fixed a number of bugs and added a caching feature that lets you play the video from your own machine instead of streaming from Apple's servers.\n Alistair, I was running the original release, and have now updated to the\nmost recent and all is good ... really like the caching piece! I'm also now\nwatching the repo so I'll be aware of future updates. Thanks.\n\nOn Fri, Nov 6, 2015 at 11:29 AM Alistair McMillan notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @pylebecq https://github.com/pylebecq Try the most recent beta.

Using the latest beta did the trick.\nThank you for your help and your work.\n  During enjoying ur saver, I find sometime it can't show the video.\nChecking the code, it just plays the mov on apple site.\nCurrently, I'm downloading the video and trying to rebuild the code to support offline mode.\nDo u think it's necessary ?\n Aye, quite critical for me since my accommodation limit my data. Don't want to load the video from the web again and again\n @guoyida the video is quite big as 5GB+, u can try download first\n actually, I already did. what if create a link and play the local video?\n Once you have the videos downloaded locally, you can use the SaveHollywood screensaver to play them.\n\nhttp://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/SaveHollywood/about.html\n How to download the video?\n @lihanst just check the json in the AreialView file\n I already add a basic cache. You can try it on https://github.com/yourtion/Aerial .\n\nTry to download this one https://github.com/yourtion/Aerial/releases/download/v1.2/Aerial.saver.zip \n\nI would try to add offline mode first\n Thank you. I tried that 1.2 version just now, and found  the \"Screen Saver Options...\" dialog doesn't open properly.   Issue reported here:  https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/65\n\nThis is the same problem I had with the 1.1 version.  And so I reverted back to the 1.0 version and it's working fine...\n I published a basic offline mode version. You can download and have a try. Because the bad network and I work offline so the offline mode is needed.\n\nhttps://github.com/yourtion/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3/Aerial.saver.zip\n @Fofer you can see the release note https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/releases/tag/v1.1\n\n_Previous version required Yosemite, 1.1 is now Mavericks compatible, but will show videos in aspect ratio mode instead of fill mode._\n @yourtion: thanks for the release note, but I have been using Yosemite this whole time...\n\nIn any case I just downloaded the 1.2beta version and it's working for me, so that's been fixed.  Thanks @JohnCoates!\n\nI then tried the 1.3 version and the same problem (the \"Screen Saver Options...\" dialog not opening properly) came back.\n\nSo I reverted to the 1.2beta version and will stay here awhile...\n  Read cache `mov` file from `~/Downloads/AerialMovCache/`\n for issues #24 \n @JohnCoates It's the base cache now. My idea is users can download the video themselves because Chinese has bad network.The base case is cache on-demand and user can put the cache file on cache directory manual and I working on it now\n @JohnCoates I already finish cache on-demand and user can put the cache file on cache directory manual function. Try it.\n Can you merge pull requests first because the user from china can't use Aerial without cache? I will try to make them working in the same stream\n +1 for adding the self cache option.\n\nI have no idea if that's possible, but for making it user friendlier it would be better to have a nice user interface allowing users to click a \"download\" button for each video they want to cache.\n @dimsav I will try to add it late,it's the most basic cache feature for those person in bad network like me.I add a basic offline mode now.( https://github.com/yourtion/Aerial/releases/download/v1.3/Aerial.saver.zip )\n\nI will try too add the feature to let user start download manual.\n :+1:\n  It would be a lot more graceful if Aerial faded each scene into each other when a scene ends rather than cutting to the next scene. Given the calming nature of these video clips, a five or six second fade give or take would make it a lot less jarring. \n :+1: \n +1\n  At first, thank you bring this to mac, but I found a probelm after install or copy to ~/Library/Screen Savers. \n Its working fine for me . just double click on the file and it itself gets installed. No need to copy it.\n Same here. Installing an preview is working, but its not starting like my regular screensaver. Display stays black.\n Do you have have Litte Snitch or an other firewall installed?\n not working for me too with copy to  ~/Library/Screen Savers and with install is stay black \n For me it install when double clicking, but the video stops after 1-2secs of loading, is this normal?\n @tobsen Thanks, that was the point. Didn't notice it...\n Got a similar issue. I am behind a firewall though, could that be an issue? Also using multiple displays.\n Didn't work for me due to Little Snitch, but after updating the rule works perfectly, thanks!\n I am on Mac Book Air with El Capitan and the screen saver starts and the animation runs between 1 and 3 seconds than stops or freezes, no recovery or continuation. No Little Snitch installed, firewall is the one that comes with El Capitan. Any thoughts? \n\n1st Update... Downloaded the \"signed\" version posted in one of the other threads, which works somewhat better, i.e. it runs 3-5 seconds and can then be restarted by pressing the spacebar, which gets it to run between 1-2 seconds before it stops again. \n\n2nd Update... see Update 1, I changed location now and can say that it seems to be related to available Internet bandwidth, i.e. speed and buffering. When I am on a 6Mb or higher connection then things get better, but what seems to have the highest effect is to wait for the first \"freeze\", give it 30+ sec and then hit the spacebar to continue. Then it runs for a good while until it stops again. Not what it is intended to do, but at least one gets the idea of what it is supposed to be like. ;-)\n\n3rd Update... Updated to 1.2. Beta 3... No improvement over 1.1 signed. Actually, the only version that recovers and seems to keep caching in the background when the animations is haltet is 1.1. signed, which continues when one waits before hitting the spacebar again. Interestingly enough the spacebar should call it out of ScreenSaver mode, but does not. Not a problem though, as I always hit the ESC to get out of the screensaver. Nice work though, will love it when it works. :-)\n My issues still persist BUT they appear to be happening behind a firewall only. On my home network the screensaver works fine.\n Yes, thought it to be a firewall/router related issue, but I have tried it\nat multiple homes and the results seem to be random. I have more the\nimpression that it has to do with resource loading on the laptop, the\nnetwork latency or the server where the video gets served from. I say that\nmainly, because it seems random between the various themes. Sometimes they\nwork, sometimes they don\u00b9t. Are the various themes/videos locally stored or\nare they network server, or are they only the first time network served and\nthen cached on the local drive?\n OK, downloaded the new version. It seems to work. I will watch it under\nvarious conditions and report back in a few days. Thanks for the update. -\nBerthold \n the new version work for me now~ only when preview. when my computer go to real screen, still show black screen sometimes. I am in china, maybe it's the network issue\n @alistairmcmillan that works!\n  Since installing the screensaver my computer will not shut down the display or sleep the HD. I have verified that all my power management settings are correct. I am running OS X El Capitan on a 2009 iMac 24\". \nThank you for porting this to Mac!\n Same here. iMac Mid 2011, OS X 10.11.1 El Capitan.\n Same issue on my MacBook Pro plugged to the Cinema Display. OS X 10.11.1 El Capitan.\n Duplicate of #23 \n  Love what you've done with this. My desktop wallpaper now looks incredible when I choose to run the following command in an open terminal window:\n\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background\n\nThis isn't an issue, just a note. Thought it was worth mentioning for those that weren't aware of this neat little trick.\n I made a script with it and bundled it into an app, when I need to clear my mind, I just open the app.\n @agucova could you please share your script \ud83d\ude04 \n @joshnh, @agucova, @zongren \r\nthis application that I wrote uses a launch agent. (open source feedback appreciated)\r\nhttps://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/Aerial_Desktop\r\n\r\nIt never opens more than one instance of Aerial. It loads from sleep or from startup. It automatically selects Aerial as the screensaver but that can be changed rather easily. It is meant to be incredibly simple click to install/enable click to uninstall/disable.\r\n\r\nWant to switch to a new video after its already running? click uninstall and install and your desktop background will be different.\r\n\r\nMeant to be super user friendly for my friends who are not programmers.\r\n\r\nDoes exactly what you are looking for and if you do not want it on all the time you can click uninstall and install it whenever you want. My laptop MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012) can run for 6 hours without needing a charge. So it does not consume a lot of resources. Chrome usually more expensive. Regards, Michael Dimmitt.  I start the video, there is a very short lapse where it works (100ms or less), and then it freezes permanently, I'm in a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) running OSX 10.11. I really don't think is a graphic performance problem, since this mac has a Intel Iris 1536 MB... \n This happens every time. I tried reinstalling and every normal troubleshooting step.\n Have same problem\n`MBP (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)  OSX 10.11`\n I have seen 4 issues, all in El Capitan (10.11)\n If I press space, it lasts a little longer, and pauses again (As I said, 100ms or less)\n I'm on a mid 2015 MacBook Pro and am not having any issues. Although occasionally it pauses for a second or two while buffering towards the start of the screensaver.\n I have the same problem\n`<MBP (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) OSX 10.11>`\n Same. iMAc-Late 2009: video in freeze after ~1000ms, then screensaver options are empty - can not select any video.\n Same problem here on a Mac Pro (Early 2009).\n I have 3 screens with OS X 10.11. I can play the same aerial shot on all three, but if I choose to use a different shot for each screen, it freezes like the others have mentioned. 2 of the 3 screens will eventually buffer, but 1 will stay frozen. Not the same one every time. \n Beta 5 working for now for me - after 5 testes all is ok. Will test more\n  The computer does not go in sleep mode anymore when screensaver is playing .\n +1\n Duplicate of issue #32 and possibly issue #23 .\n There is a possible solution proposed in the first post of issue #23 (duplicate of this one)\n  This is an extremely common option (available on all Mac screensavers as far as I know) but I'll make the request explicit: I'd like to make it so I put my screensaver on, and after X seconds with the screensaver on, it would require my password to regain access to the desktop.\n The option to \"Require password [ immediately | 5 seconds | etc ] after sleep or screen saver begins\" is available under the Security & Privacy preference pane in OS X. It's implemented at a system level, not within the screensavers themselves.\n\nTry it yourself. Just tested it myself here and it works okay with this screensaver for me.\n I'm familiar with how it works, and I haven't changed that setting. This screensaver just isn't behaving the same as other screensavers for me. Maybe this is just local to my machine?\n It's asking for my password as expected. I have \"Require password 5 seconds after sleep or screen saver begins\" set, and the password dialogue comes up as expected in that case. \n\nExtra cool bit: the video continues playing behind the prompt's blur overlay, so the blurred colors continue to shift slowly as I type my password in. Nice.\n\nI'm running OS X 10.11.1.\n I'm on the latest version of Yosemite.\n\nI went in to check my password settings, and it had changed to \"require password after 1 minute\" instead of the previous setting \"5 seconds\". Even as I'm writing this, I'm aware it sounds like I'm making this up. But there is no way it was set to 1 minute for long, as I use this computer for work and made sure it locks quickly. \n\nIt's possible a recent OS update reset this setting, and I just hadn't noticed until changing screen savers. Feel free to resolve if it's not reproducible. \n  Hi!\n\nI love your screensaver! Very very nice work :+1: \nUnfortunately my Mac is not able to shut down the monitor anymore.\nNormally I can set some time in the System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> Turn display off after x minutes \n\nWould be awesome if you were able to fix this :D\nBut I am guessing you have heaps of new issues just today ;)\n\nThanks again for the awesome work!\n Possibly related to issue #23 .\n I think this is a duplicate of #23, not just related.\n  Unfortunately Aerial doesn't work correctly!\n John might need a little more information on the problem to fix it for you. In what way is Aerial not working for you? Do you get an error message? Does it not launch at all? Do the videos hang?\n It doesn't launch partly. It looks like someone pushes pause when video is streaming. That's all\n\n\u041e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441 iPhone\n Same problem here? Maybe? (Look my latest issue)\n  I am running Yosemite, version 10.10.5.

But once it starts running it looks like it get stuck. I restarted my computer and tried again and nothing. I am running OS X 10.11 in a Retina MacBook Pro 2013 i7 8gb. If you need more info feel free to contact me: carlosmunguia30@outlook.com  You have made a wonderful job with this screensavers, I hope you could help!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nCarlos Mungu\u00eda\n Same here, again (Look my latest issue)... 3 and counting.\n  Note that this same screensaver works perfectly on my identical iMac using identical Mac OS version at home.

All works, however, when pressing spacebar it pauses the video, but for only 1 screen, (the main screen) and not the secondary screen.\n\nIn my case, my main screen is the external monitor.\n  Error states its not compatible with OSX. I'm currently running el capitan 10.11.1.\n\nThanks for making this awesome project open source!\n Here's a screenshot\n\n<img width=\"412\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-10-27 at 10 03 35 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1015885/10764051/030b2f40-7c92-11e5-97d3-14fc6eac4a4c.png\">\n Try this suggestion: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/4#issuecomment-151557047\n  Can someone alter these files and maybe make them available for the iPhone/iPad ? \nMaybe a jailbreak developer could package it as a tweak? \n\nBattery drainer or not. I'm surely not the only one praying for this?\n @RuggedBrother Seeing as the iPhone 6s has received Live Wallpapers in iOS 9, something could be made out of these videos.\n I just hope they're not copywritten. \nI've posted the idea on Reddit in the form of a request. \nI also reached out to avfew developers via Cydia. \nI honestly don't think there's much else I can do, just hope word of mouth spreads.\n This screensaver is currently dedicated to Mac only right now.\r\n@glouel Maybe leave this one open but otherwise........... Close  I'm using a 15inch macbook pro(mid 2015) with OS X 10.11.  And when I launch the screen saver, I just saw a black screen with nothing.  Hope to fix it :)\n I have the same issue, only this issue is only present when I do not have a scaled resolution.\n\nI prefer to use a more space resolution, and then the screensaver does not work.\n\nIt does work when I put the screen on default resolution.\n I just use the default resolution, still not work\n I use the hot corner to launch the screen saver. When I launch it, the screen seems to be pure black.  After a short period of time, until I need password to return to the desktop. I clicked 'X' to cancel it and back to the screen saver. Strange thing happened, it just works! And I don't know why. ( poor English :( )\n I have the same issue. I get a black screen when I try to run on a 15 inch MacBook Pro\nHere is the error I'm seeing in the system log\nOct 27 12:37:02 selma5 ScreenSaverEngine[17116]: [12:37:02.674] <<<< AVPlayer >>>> -[AVPlayer setOutputContext:]: No figPlayer found, cannot set picker id\n I too have a 15 inch MBP and while the preview works, I get a circle with a line though it when the actual screensaver starts.  \n Mine is working now. I noticed in another thread about Little Snitch blocking it, so I checked and it was blocked. I made a rule to allow it and now it works fine.\n I have a mid 2015 15\" MacBook Pro running 10.11.1 and am not having any issues at all.\n Maybe the network problem cause the issue\n  Is this available in a crisp 5120x2880 resolution for the iMac 5k? Screen saver looks great, but would be absolutely jaw-dropping in 5k. Thanks!\n These are loaded directly from apple servers. since apple tv only supports 1080p, that's the resolution they provide. there won't be 4k until apple decides \uf8fftv supports 4k. I doubt about 5k anytime soon. \n Kind of sucks that they are only available in 1080p.\n _shakes fist @ apple_\n +1 I would love this. At least for MBP retina. It does not look as sharp as on apple tv, which is even a bigger screen.\n\nMaybe Apple are now also streaming 4k or retina versions of the screensavers through their API? Worth investigation. \n +1 This is probably why they haven't added the screensaver to macOS themselves; the videos don't look great on a Mac.  Hello Aerial team,\n\nI have noticed that the screen saver preview and the actual screen saver does not load. Both of them start up on my screen with the initial frame of a city but won't start even after a couple of minutes. I am running El Capitan. I hope this helps! \n  The app installs and is displayed in Screen Saver preferences pane but will not execute. \n I experienced this issue and cloned the repo to check it out; however, once I built Aerial.saver in XCode 7.1 the screensaver began working.  After this, the preferences pane stopped working.\n\nSummary:  Running Aerial.saver directly from GitHub, I can access the Preference Pane and set my options, but the video will not preview and the screensaver will not run.  After building from source, the preferences pane is inoperable, but the screensaver works.\n\nI'll try to take a look at this tonight unless someone beats me to it.\n Also try this suggestion: https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/issues/4#issuecomment-151557047\n   +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n :+1: \n +1 \n Please!!\n\nIdeally, this would be based on sunset/rise times (like f.lux's auto dark mode switching), and even that can't be very hard to implement.\n +1\n For when is the next release scheduled? I'd like to see a beta containing this change. \n +1 +1 +1  ![screen shot 2015-10-27 at 1 01 42 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4676105/10758730/1d598086-7cab-11e5-8899-8d0a11e27ead.png)\n This is gatekeeper in OS X stopping it. You have 2 options.  You can right click the .saver file and select \"Open\" then the dialog will appear again but this time with another button labeled \"Open\". Click open. This will allow the application to run. The other option is to disable gatekeeper. In System Preferences, Select \"Security & Privacy\", On the \"General\" tab, in the lower section \"Allow apps downloaded from:\" select \"Anywhere\". You may need to unlock this pane using your admin password if the settings are locked.\n @alistairmcmillan @travislent Nope. I refuse to install any unsigned apps. Asking users to disable protection against malware or install unverified apps is a horrendous thing to do. Had to go through the code and compile and sign it myself.\n  I am attempting to use this screensaver at work, where we use a proxy. I have installed but the images do not load. After a period of time, a play button with a line through it appears - indicating the content could not be played.\n\nProxy has been set in network settings and inside terminal profile.\n I have the same issue as well, the screensaver does work fine at my home though.  Our proxy is network based and does not have any settings on our computers that I can find.  \n I have the same issue as @Gatewayy and cannot influence the settings\n  When using on my MBP 13\" 2015 model, with an external monitor, a different video is shown on each of the screens, but only one plays, the other seems to freeze. OSX 10.11.1.\n Additional information:  I'm running MBP 13\" 2015 with OSX 10.11.1 with 3 monitors.  This issue occurs sporadically and typically only affects 1 of the 3 monitors.  It is not limited to external monitors and has happened on my built-in screen.  It seems to affect some videos more than others and occasionally, the videos will resume after a 10-15 second delay.  When the screensaver begins, all videos play for 1-3 seconds and then one of them will hang.\n  I cannot enable one of all the screen saver : \n![screen 1 - copie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14280044/10755225/9fcfd574-7c9c-11e5-903f-f10a237d7dca.jpg)\nAny solutions ?\n![sans titre - copie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14280044/10755262/d6c2677c-7c9c-11e5-9aa6-b61171015e21.jpg)\n No, nothing\n ![sans titre - copie](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14280044/10755422/099478ce-7c9e-11e5-9c27-ce886fe413b8.jpg)\nthat \n Not working after restarting\n It's working now, thanks you\n  Selecting the screen saver in system preferences, gives the following erros in the console.app:\n\n```\n27.10.15 10:48:00,819 System Preferences[55536]: Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints:\n(\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb148428c70 NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484da660'-'.width == NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14a993ea0'-'.width>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb14842baf0 NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14aa19320'-'.trailing == NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14a993ea0'-'.trailing>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb14847dcc0 NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14a993ea0'-'.leading == NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14aa19320'-'.leading>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb14a99ab20 NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484a0a70'-'.trailing == NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484da660'-'.trailing>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb14a9918e0 NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484da660'-'.leading == NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484a0a70'-'.leading>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb148489470 NSImageView:0x7fb14847dc00.centerX == NSBox:0x7fb14aa18b00'Aktive Ecken'.centerX>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb148428d30 H:[NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14aa19320'-']-(29)-[NSImageView:0x7fb14847dc00](LTR)>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb148438170 H:[NSImageView:0x7fb14847dc00]-(29)-[NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484a0a70'-'](LTR)>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb14a998950 NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14aa19320'-'.left == NSBox:0x7fb14aa18b00'Aktive Ecken'.left + 34>\",\n    \"<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb14a99ab70 NSBox:0x7fb14aa18b00'Aktive Ecken'.right == NSPopUpButton:0x7fb1484a0a70'-'.right + 35>\"\n)\n\nWill attempt to recover by breaking constraint \n<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7fb148428d30 H:[NSPopUpButton:0x7fb14aa19320'-']-(29)-[NSImageView:0x7fb14847dc00](LTR)>\n\nSet the NSUserDefault NSConstraintBasedLayoutVisualizeMutuallyExclusiveConstraints to YES to have -[NSWindow visualizeConstraints:] automatically called when this happens.

I think this happens because of our company firewall/proxy. I can't load the videos directly from apple nether.\n Yea I have the same error, really odd - can't load the videos on the webpage either.\n So I guess the screensaver is not to blame here. What could be a way to prevent such errors is to download the files before playing them since I can wget the files but can't stream them\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/knS90qB.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N3RoK8n.png)\n How about go ahead and update your os to the release version. It is working fine on 10.11.1.\n Thanks for the suggestion.

I'm on 10.11.1 (15B42) as well and here everything works as expected. Great project by the way. Would be cool to see configuration possibility that the night views only show after sunset or a specific time. \n How did you build it? Which version of Xcode?\n\nCan you post the console logs?\n I am getting the same error in OSX 10.10.4, using the precompiled saver.\n Maybe the following will help debug the issue:\n\nType in the terminal \n`open /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app` to activate the screensaver. Be sure it is selected beforehand.\nAnd grep your system.log for ScreenSaverEngine and post it here:\n`tail -f /var/log/system.log|grep ScreenSaverEngine`\n Weird: now it works, but I haven't done anything yet...\n Wierd!

Broken for me on El Capitan 10.11.6.\r\n\r\nUnderstood that it's possibly a macOS bug with Swift though at this point, as per link above. I was almost about to post that it didn't work, because I closed SP and went back in, but I missed the fact that you said select this screensaver, then exit, then re-open. That did the trick, thanks.\r\n\r\nI wish there was a \"Me too\" button for Apple bugs like there is for Sonos sw issues, for example. Or any sort of a vote, really. I get the same error. I'm using 10.12.3\r\n @alistairmcmillan, @JohnCoates, after alistair's previous comment I did some experimentation. Does not solve the underlying problem, but does create a solution where users will not have the issue any longer. relates to #349 \r\n<b>terminal commands:</b>\r\n\r\n```defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver modulePath -string \"/System/Library/Screen Savers/Shell.saver\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleName -string \"Shell\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict moduleName Shell path /System/Library/Screen\\ Savers/Shell.saver/ type 0;```\r\n\r\n```defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver modulePath -string \"~/Library/Screen\\ Savers/Aerial.saver\"; defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleName -string \"Aerial\";defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver moduleDict -dict moduleName Aerial path ~/Library/Screen\\ Savers/Aerial.saver type 0;```\r\n\r\n```/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/./ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine;```\r\n\r\nThese are terminal commands. As terminal commands they are not currently very useful because as Alistair mentioned a user could manually close and reopen System Preferences. However, if incorporated into Aerial.saver as commands at the end. Then users should no longer see the problem and the fix will be automatically handled. Another benefit would be Aerial would by default be the screensaver. Which was the goal of #349. \r\n\r\nThis solved the problem for me which was still occurring as of: <b>Sierra 10.12.4</b>\r\nwhich only had issue when clicking <b>\"Install for this user only\".</b>\r\nThis issue never presented itself when clicking <b>\"Install for all users of this computer\".</b> @alistairmcmillan, \"Aerial.saver\" currently runs and sets everything up. \r\nBut then, I agree something with Apple causes issues. \r\nHowever, turning it on and off should fix that. \r\nAnd Aerial.saver can turn it on and off.\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to make a pull request so that you can see what I am talking about? Using the newest version on 10.12.4, same issue. However, I fixed it quickly by going into Terminal and changing the permissions to match the other Screensavers.\r\n\r\n\"chmod -R og+x Aerial.saver; chown -R root:wheel Aerial.saver\" @kennyluk, interesting. I wonder if that was the cause of the issue. \r\npotentially all that needs to be changed is the permissions in a pull request. \r\n\r\nAny others find this as a solution that works for them?\r\n<br>Do you really have to use chown? would the chmod command be enough?\r\n`chmod -R og+x Aerial.saver`\r\n\r\nThe permissions might be an issue for zipped files. If that is true. I may have a workaround.\r\nSo let me know if the `@` permission needs to be removed when the file is extracted from the  zipped release file.  You have to use Xcode 8 (I tried 8.3.2 in High Sierra) and compile while change compiler to Swift 3.0 \r\nProblem will disapper.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"426\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-12-20 at 00 03 26\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/485713/34178724-429d9d7c-e519-11e7-8fcf-b55465f67a2a.png\">\r\n  Aerial is a great program that runs exceptionally on my Mac, but I also have a Windows laptop and would love to have a similar system run on that. I understand that Aerial is written in Swift so porting would be difficult but I thought I'd just leave this here in case anyone wants to work towards it \ud83d\ude42.\n @A1fus what version of Windows are you running on?\n Might be worth waiting for when they open source Swift? Might be easy to port then. \n @elliottregan Not really, most frameworks used here (and they are quite powerful) won't be available to other platforms so it won't mean an easier port (the pure Swift part here is pretty tiny).\n @llahnoraa I'm running the latest Windows 10 build.\n In a moment, display screen saver when there will be caton black screen, and video playback.My system is EI Capitan.\n One of the problems of developing an equivalent on Windows is that Windows doesn't support QuickTime movies natively and Apple stopped supporting their QuickTime for Windows SDK a wee while ago (2006?).\n\nI have some ideas though. :)\n Okay so @cDima has made [his own version](https://github.com/cDima/Aerial) of Aerial specifically for Windows.\n @A1fus indeed, it works on my Windows 10 latest build machine and leverages Windows support for MP4. \n Thanks, John, for the link.  We can actually utilize GitHub's CDN for files like these. Makes the repo cleaner.\n\nhttps://vinkla.com/posts/upload-images-github/\n :+1: Yeah, this is mostly for cleaning up the repository with redundant files.\n  Seems AerialVideo should have a better description? \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3w1fkrefd57hiz7/Screenshot%202015-10-26%2022.19.16.png?dl=0\n Ha! I was going to submit a PR.
