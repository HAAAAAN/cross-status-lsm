I don't know if it is intended to work like it does, but while playing the ladder levels and simulating them, I noticed that if I submit my code for both teams (Red and Blue), they end up fighting each other (several times in the first matches), and one of them falls behind. This makes it somewhat impossible to be the best of both teams' ladders.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to prevent players from fighting against themselves.  When choosing the programming language to use in the campaign through the PlayHeroesModal, the description of the programming languages appears twice.\r\n\r\n![repeated](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/20393692/a9323814-acd4-11e6-9d6a-36839c508904.png)  Will reopen if CLA is signed.  Hello, @hikla! Thank you for contributing. Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that we can merge your pull request?\n Will reopen if CLA is signed.  When spectating ladder games in the levels \"Cavern Survival\", \"Dueling Grounds\", \"Multiplayer Treasure Grove\" and \"Harrowland\", I can't see the whole map, because it is zoomed in. If I try to zoom out, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the most of the spectated games, they always seem to end with a time out (without any of the teams winning). These examples are from \"Dueling Grounds\", where all the matches I saw timed out:\n- [1](http://direct.codecombat.com/play/spectate/dueling-grounds?session-one=555a18956dcc3985057e849d&session-two=555c9b54a9f1558605b323e2)\n- [2](http://direct.codecombat.com/play/spectate/dueling-grounds?session-one=549208fc214f153f07061be9&session-two=561399b65428fd8905f32759)\n- [3](http://direct.codecombat.com/play/spectate/dueling-grounds?session-one=555a18956dcc3985057e849d&session-two=553af1c0f435a38b0512289f)\n\nI think the code never runs, because the heroes just stand there doing nothing.\n  The levels \"Gems in the Deep\", \"Kithgard Gates\" and \"Winding Trail\" use the keyword 'self' instead of 'hero' when playing in the language Lua.  Awesome work, @CatSkald! Thank you for contributing.\n\n/cc @nwinter - are you available to answer @CatSkald's questions?\n  Awesome, @Justinschut! Thank you \ud83d\udc4d\n  While the default code for CoffeeScript levels uses the keyword \"hero.\", the autocomplete uses \"@\".  If I click the 'Open Item Shop' button in the level 'The Raised Sword' after I try to defeat the munchkins and I am prompted to buy more armor, the modal that opens breaks the game and I can't close it. I can no longer reproduce it either. But when I saw the issue, I was playing with the hero 'Alejandro' in a brand new account using the CoffeeScript language.\n\nNote: I think that when this was happening, I was receiving every achievement twice.\n  Hello, @FilipStappers!

Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that we can merge your pull request?\n\nRegarding the coverage, you don't need to make any change, because it is not relevant to the changes you made.\n \ud83d\udc4d\n  Did you meant to remove the image at 'app/assets/images/level/popover_border_background.png'?\n  I don't know if it would be easy or not to implement, but it would be nice if there was a \"Version History\" for achievements, similar to those in the other editors, because sometimes it is hard to tell if the save actually had effect on the achievement being edited.\n This seems more like a UX problem; it should be made clearer that changes have been made. Adding version history would be too complex a solution.\n If there was some kind of visual feedback when changes are saved successfully, it would be enough. I just suggested the version history, because it leaves no doubts.\n  When I try to access a poll through the poll editor ([example](http://direct.codecombat.com/editor/poll/after-playing-codecombat-how-interested-are-you-in-programming)) without having access to it (like when I'm logged out or logged in with a normal account), I get this error in the console:\n- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'build' of null @ PollEditView.coffee:58\n\nNote: Similar to #3266.\n  /cc @nwinter\n  Always up-to-date!

This basically just changes the upsert session handler to create a new session if there isn't already a session _for the language set in the classroom_. This also updates the student and teacher views and endpoints, filtering out sessions by language so that progress and level progression takes the separation into account.\n  The graphic bug is confirmed, and in our bug list. This is not the only hammer that has this issue.\n  Hello, @AndriuVGA! Thank you for contributing. Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that we can merge your pull request?\n No problem \ud83d\ude09\n  In the homepage, there are two buttons in the top right of the page (for students it's \"Continue Playing\" and \"Go to My Courses\"; for campaign players it's \"Continue Playing\" and \"View My Profile\") and both of them redirect to the same page, which seems redundant to me.\n  Hello, @alirezasamimi100! Thank you for contributing. Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that we can merge your pull request?\n @alirezasamimi100, can you sign the CLA? It is really easy.\n Thanks, @alirezasamimi100\n  While I was simulating some Cavern Survival games, the simulator crashed twice:\n\nFirst time:\n- ------------------- Destroying  Simulator and making a new one -----------------\n-  Populated defaults for Level Cavern Survival in 24ms @ CocoModel.coffee:100\n- |Hecate's Cheryl| Modern javascript detected, aw yeah! @ Angel.coffee:57\n- |Hecate's Cheryl| Worker initialized after 4641ms @ Angel.coffee:57\n- SuperModel report ------------------------ @ SuperModel.coffee:22\n- 98 resources. @ SuperModel.coffee:23\n\nAll resources have the loaded property set to true, except a thang (I think it was \"Health Potion Large\").\n\nSecond time:\nAll resources have the loaded property set to true, except one 'thang_names'.\n  Don't know if it is intended or not, but when I hover over a dot of a locked level (the grey ones), the cursor isn't changed to an hand.\n  Switched us to Swagger, which provides a [spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) for APIs and an ecosystem of related libraries. Some possible later improvements:\n- Split the API into several files, using schema references\n- Have API endpoints use swagger files to parse and enforce parameters\n- Document internal-use routes as well\n- [Generate a JS client](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js), which both server tests and client (such as Backbone models/collections) can use.\n\n[Check out the docs](http://19nqw4-codecombat-staging-codecombat.runnableapp.com/api-docs), which is just an interface generated from `swagger.yaml`.\n\nAlso set up `PUT /api/users/:handle/license` so that third parties can grant created users access to the classroom version. As part of that, refactored some more redeem code into Prepaid.redeem.\n  \ud83d\udc4d\n  Hello, @Juchuhsu! Thank you for contributing. Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that we can merge your pull request?\n Thank you, @Juchuhsu \ud83d\udc4d\n   This is the basis for third parties to incorporate CodeCombat as part of their curriculums and programs. These third parties can:\n- Create users\n- Give OAuth2 identities\n- Grant premium access\n- Fetch progress info about the users\n\nSince third parties will both be interacting with CodeCombat as an API Client and logging in their users as OAuth2 Providers, these roles are in two separate collections: `Client` and `OAuthProvider`. The `OAuthProvider` collection can also eventually be used as the basis for existing identity integrations we have: Facebook, G+ and Clever.\n\nPrepaids have been slightly extended to serve as a record of 'purchases' by third parties. They're currently used for buying premium access for other users (type `'terminal_subscription'`) and for licenses bought by schools for course access (type `'course'`). The former is for a length of time (months), the latter is for a specific time frame (from date to date). With this new version, the `'terminal_subscription'` type can now be for a specific time frame, and that's used also to keep track of how much has been 'spent' by these third parties. I also added `clientCreator` to be clear when a prepaid is made by an API Client as opposed to a user.\n  Awesome, @Justinschut \ud83d\udc4d\n  Thanks, @cundamic\n  This was more to satisfy the JSON schema requirement(?) that schemas be identified with and available at a URL. We don't use it ourselves, internally. Instead we package schemas with everything else.\n  There is a typo in the code of the level Keeping Time in the JavaScript laguage: while in the comment it says to collect coins in the first 30 seconds, the code says `hero.now() < 35`.\n  Awesome, @cundamic \ud83d\udc4d\n  Thank you, @kumabotz!\n  Thank you for contributing, @HelloSeaNation!\n  Hedge Magic will need to be adjusted if we go with another project level.\n\nWill also need to differentiate start/end tracking pixels by HoC activity, but we don't have those yet.\n  /cc @nwinter\n  Thank you for contributing, @bragagia!\n  Thank you for contributing, @pagrette!\n  Still happening:\n- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'compile' of undefined @ SpellView.coffee:656\n- module.exports.SpellView.saveSpade @ SpellView.coffee:656\n- (anonymous function) @ SpellView.coffee:1\n- module.exports.SpellView.onContactButtonPressed @ SpellView.coffee:580\n- publish @ backbone-mediator.js:128\n- module.exports.PlayLevelView.onContactClicked @ PlayLevelView.coffee:608\n- bound @ lodash.js:729\n- dispatch @ jquery.js:4435\n- elemData.handle @ jquery.js:4121\n  Thanks, @nachein \ud83d\udc4d\n  @iammehmetguler, are you available to finish this pull request?\n  Link to level: http://direct.codecombat.com/editor/level/team-work\n  Awesome work! Can you [sign the CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so we can merge this in?\n  I just switched all the Clojure multiplayer sessions to JavaScript, so I think this should be fixed. Can you simulate some more on Cavern Survival and reopen this if you see it again?\n Happened again:\n-  GET http://direct.codecombat.com/javascripts/app/vendor/aether-clojure.js 404 (Not Found) @ preloadjs-NEXT.combined.js:3801\n Another one:\n-  GET http://direct.codecombat.com/javascripts/app/vendor/aether-io.js 404 (Not Found) @ preloadjs-NEXT.combined.js:3801\n Saw another one in 'Cavern Survival':\n- GET http://direct.codecombat.com/javascripts/app/vendor/aether-clojure.js 404 (Not Found) @ preloadjs-NEXT.combined.js:3801\n- GET http://direct.codecombat.com/.../javascripts/app/vendor/aether-io.js 404 (Not Found) @ vendor.js:33056\n In 'Harrowland':\n- GET http://direct.codecombat.com/javascripts/app/vendor/aether-clojure.js 404 (Not Found) @ preloadjs-NEXT.combined.js:3801\n In 'Dueling Grounds':\n- GET http://direct.codecombat.com/javascripts/app/vendor/aether-clojure.js 404 (Not Found) @ preloadjs-NEXT.combined.js:3801\n  Fixed in a9c8077\n  Looks like the `else` isn't allowed there because the indentation is wrong. `else` needs to be at the same indentation level as the `if`.\n\n@basicer looks like Esper logs `Dont know how to transform: Delete` for the `del` usage. Then it pops an error just saying `Up`. Can we support, or make a better error message?\n Our interpreter doesn't yet recognize the else: clause of any loops.  I haven't been able to think of a great way to translate that construct into javascript code without causing side effects. There's an explicit error message that this is not supported for `while` loops.  Ill add it for `for` loops.\r\n\r\nThe `del` keywords also isn't supported at all.  It should be pretty easy to implement by translating it from `del x` to `x = undefined` in javascript. Fixed in https://github.com/codecombat/skulpty/commit/ea604912cd14da5b8b687b81e8ca914ec39a9218  Cool! I commented on the survey issue; hope this helps. Will leave this open in case others want to chime in or get informed.\n Nah, I haven't really been following any.\n  Is this on Windows or Linux? Can you copy and paste elsewhere on CodeCombat (not in the game but on, say, the homepage)?\n  I want to keep this around and hook it back up someday instead of removing it.\n Yeah, it's been sitting there a long time. I have this issue here, so we will eventually restore it! https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/3468\n  I think it's fixed\u2013closing for now. Can re-open if it's still happening.\n  It's by design that you can skip ahead to levels if you know the name of the level you want to go to. If you are able to do the code and you have the gear, then why not skip the easier stuff?\n  Looks good apart from my notes.\n  Shouldn't we have an error message when trying to write into a protected property, though? How is it protected?\n  > on some test accounts first.\n\nI can be a guinea-pig. I have many unclosed broken achievements :-)\n  I have fixed all 3 of these.\n\nI'm deeply ashamed all 3 of those got through. I remember going back and improving the sample code for that level, so I can't believe I let those 3 issues slip through.\n\nGive the code a reload and let me know if you see any more errors.\n    This displays errors for web-dev levels. They're caught by the iFrame using `window.onerror`, and passed along to the WebSurfaceView. SpellView handles them separately from Aether errors.\n\nThis includes a refactor of Problem to allow wrapping of non-Aether problems.\n\nI also monkey-patch `@aceSession.setAnnotations` (which the HTML worker uses) to not clear any annotations we generated ourselves; those are cleared manually by us with `@reallySetAnnotations`. This is instead of the old method of reacting to onChangeAnnotations, removing the annotation flicker that we hid with CSS.\n Problems found so far:\n- Should probably clearWebDevErrors when script code is changed (or just in updateHTML?)\n- If you have a problem that's only caught on a UI event, and you add/remove lines of code from the `<script>` tag before the erroring line, subsequent triggerings of the error will display an error on the wrong line, because the new JS hasn't been inserted into the page yet.\n  - IIRC there's something that tracks when lines are inserted/deleted in ace; should probably use that\n  - Or just don't display errors that occur between code changes and clicking \"cast\", or display them differently\n Did a bunch of refactoring, although I didn't merge the two flows as much as I wanted.\n\nIt'd be best if you could double-check if I'm using 'isCast' along the lines of what it's supposed to represent, and if the Aether handling code looks equivalent.\n\nAnd at line 835, is `problem.message` an acceptable substitute for `problem.userInfo.key` for determining if an error is unique or not?\n    This adds support for the `programming.UsesJQuery` and `programming.UsesWebJavaScript` components.\n\nIt also adds an \"optional\" flag for API arguments, which slightly alters the display of the doc popover.\n  Thanks! Fixed. You need to click \"Reload\" button in the top right corner of the editor.\n  @Kevitto, thank you for the report. Could you give your session id for this level? To get it - open the dev console in your browser and find a string sessionID. It can really help to reproduce the bug and fix it.\n Ok. No problem, I think I'll find the problem. It's ok to post bugs here. Also you can write about problems with levels on the forum.\n Fixed.\n  This sends an email whenever a level doesn't load within 30sec, or if the supermodel fails.\n\nIt also fixes the retry logic so it does actually retry. Before the `@model.loading` flag was preventing it from sending another request.\n  Hi, I'm not sure of the problem you're experiencing. If you're crafty, you should be able to build fire-traps to kill the headhunter.\n\nDo you have your full code of what you wanted to do?\n So, in CodeCombat, vision matters. Even though most heroes might look comically big, they can't see through a forest!\n\nWhen I run your code, I use the time slider at the bottom to look when the hero first says anything. At that moment, the Headhunter is out of vision, so they say: \"no enemy.\"\n\nTry this code:\n\n```\nwhile True:\n    enemy = hero.findNearestEnemy()\n    if enemy:\n        hero.say(\"I see you!\")\n    else:\n        hero.say(\"No enemy...\")\n```\n\nAnd you will see the hero say \"No enemy...\" until the Headhunter gets into 'vision' range.\n  Switched to using hero.get('original') instead of hero.id so to do less fetching. I forget if there was a good reason to use id instead of original the first time.\n  That's intentional; we automatically query the server to see if there are any animations for a Mark, and if there aren't, it's fine, just a 404.\n  Thanks @trotod! I'll deploy this now.\n  The `multiplayer` flag shouldn't actually do anything; that was for synchronous multiplayer mode we were prototyping a while ago. `submitted` is the flag that controls whether a session should be ranked, and the player has no way to unsubmit...\n  Performance was really bad. Anyone tried in those browsers on older machines?\n We do have some new art ready to go for that, we just haven't implemented it yet. I could make it available if someone wants to take a crack at it.\n  This also happens when trying to access levels belonging to a course when the user is not part of one.\n  1. We were trying to make the repository as small as possible so that it would be easier for contributors to check out initially, and there were some large files in the history. This way we also didn't have to worry about whether all the files in all the old versions were legal to open source.\n2. The old history is still there in a private repo that we can check if we need to. I have never had to refer to it, though.\n3. Not sure; I never heard about it, anyway. I think most of the new developers were less interested in workflows like \"a bug has appeared, let me see what changed and what was the original reason for changing this piece of code\" and more interested in things like \"I need to add a new feature, where should I put it?\", which relies much less on checking history.\n4. If we didn't have the old repo, it wouldn't be possible to go back and view the earliest days of the project, so we wouldn't be able to satisfy our curiosity\u2013but we just moved to a new repo, we didn't delete the history out of the old one.\n\nHope this helps!\n  Great initiative @Marvellanius!\n  Thank you @JurianLock\n  All done \ud83d\udc4d \n  Hello, @Futseh!

Would like eventually to this to be a collection of thangs, such that the parent controlling GameUIState need not work with \"Lanks\" or any other Surface internals.\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Thank you, @diegotoala :+1:\n  It's better than https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/3748\nI think you might close the old one pull request.\n   \u0414\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c - \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442. \u0414\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441 \u0433\u0438\u0442\u0445\u0430\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0443\u043b\u043b \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442.\n\n\u041e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0435 - \"press\" \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \"\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c\", \u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0432 \u043a \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442.\n \u0410 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0443? \u041f\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0430\u043a - https://coco-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/ - \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0438 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c, \u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0435 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0410 \u0442\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0444\u0444\u0442\u043e\u043f \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0443\u043b\u043b \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443.\n  Hello, @shuwn!

Instead, methods should be added to models and collections according to the first recipe and used according to the second.\n  Thank you, @oliver-j!\n  This is an [aether](https://github.com/codecombat/aether) issue. Moved issue there.\n  There shouldn't be, but the code base is a bit of a mess, so sometimes weird things happen... Possibly it's because `UserView` is a subclass of `CocoView`, the others are subclasses of `RootView`. So they can be handled differently.\n \ud83d\udc4d Thanks for continuing to move our codebase in the right direction!\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Awesome :+1:\n  In PlayLevelView's event handler, have it call a function on LevelLoader. So\n\n```\n  onWorldNecessityLoadFailed: (resource) ->\n    @loadingView.showCouldNotLoadError()\n```\n\nAnd in LevelLoadingView\n\n```\n  showCouldNotLoadError: ->\n    @$('.level-loading-goals, .tip, .load-progress').hide()\n    @$('.could-not-load').show()\n```\n\nAlso, just noticed, `@$` is a shorthand you can use there instead of `@$el.find`. It's like the global $ function but scoped to the view's `el`.\n\nhttp://backbonejs.org/#View-dollar\n Aren't they effectively the same, a find scoped to the view's element?\n\nEither way, looks good to me! However, this branch seems really polluted with other changes that don't make it into the diff, particularly with vi.coffee changes. Can you turn this PR into a single commit? While on your branch, `git rebase master -i` should let you do it, although when I tried to do that it lead to conflicts. It might be better to make a new branch and [apply a patch](https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/) of this branch's difference with master on it.\n  Hello, @oliver-j!

For each one either 1) manually test and mark it tested or 2) add an automatic test for it.\n  Going to /user/scott, nothing shows up. Did you test the view in your dev environment after you refactored?\n Looks like you're getting a good handle of our kinda wonky loading system. Squashed and merged in, thanks! \ud83d\udc4d https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/4f369a1e2f32ce9a84274f3da6478513bc30f215\n  Would you like to take the lead on updating to the latest version of brunch? We don't really have the resources to do it right now, but I can create a branch for you to work on and make PRs to.\n  Try this: http://codecombat.com/play/level/sarven-outpost?session=573d6898746e452100edc7ce\n\nThere's a 404 because that session doesn't exist, but the loading screen is just blank; no error feedback.\n\nSuggested solution:\n1. Have LevelLoader emit an error when a resource fails to load\n2. Have PlayLevelView listen for that event, and render the error on the screen when that happens.\n  Well, the place to start is the [PlayLevelView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/PlayLevelView.coffee). It [relies on LevelLoader](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/PlayLevelView.coffee#L142-L143) to load from the server, and the [LevelLoadingView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/LevelLoadingView.coffee) is what is shown while everything is loaded. The [LevelLoader loads the level session](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelLoader.coffee#L112-L146), among other things. In order to handle any resource errors, not just sessions, the LevelLoader could listen to its SuperModel's ['failed' event](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/SuperModel.coffee#L226), then go from there, probably communicating to the LevelLoadingView through Backbone.Mediator, since that's what everything else in that area is doing (though not necessarily the best system in general).\n The LevelLoadingView needs to display an error. Give it a function like [these ones](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/LevelLoadingView.coffee#L199-L205) and have the PlayLevelView call it when it receives the not found error.\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  This would work... except that these are arrays and objects that will be modified, which means it would be easy for them to be shared between different instances.\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass Test\n  list: []\n\ntest1 = new Test()\ntest1.list.push('something')\ntest2 = new Test()\nconsole.log(test2.list) # outputs ['something']\n```\n\nIn this case, it's unlikely to happen, particularly because the view sets new properties to itself in the network callbacks. But it's better to ensure it won't happen, because debugging something like that can be a real hassle. So setting these properties should happen in `initialize`.\n Kind of! It's more of an interplay between CoffeeScript and JavaScript. The CoffeeScript code\n\n``` coffeescript\nclass Test\n  list: []\n```\n\nBecomes JavaScript\n\n``` javascript\nvar Test;\n\nTest = (function() {\n  function Test() {}\n\n  Test.prototype.list = [];\n\n  return Test;\n\n})();\n```\n\nSo the list property is set to prototype, getting this sort-of static behavior, unless you set a property on the instance. It looks like [JavaScript ES6 Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) sidestep the issue by not letting you define anything but functions on classes.\n\nTo see how CoffeeScript => JavaScript, check out the [CoffeeScript site](http://coffeescript.org/) and click \"Try CoffeeScript\".\n\n---\n\nChanges look good! Tested and they work. Squashed your commits and merged them in: 0e2b919ec1c42291caddf895e244b818d1f404ba\n  Sounds good!\n\nThere are many inconsistencies in the codebase, as we move generally toward using 3rd party tools the way they were intended, particularly in how we use Express on the server and Backbone on the client, and adding tests. When in doubt, [check the cookbook](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Cookbook), which has up to date guidelines, or ask on feel free to ask on #general. The latter will help us figure out what to add to the Cookbook.\n\nThanks again!\n \ud83d\udc4d \nSquashed and merged in: 2ded5ff4f063a2dda4717b0cde6d65f1bbf1a432\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Squashed and merged in: 75c7d140d16d73243d10ebf6c9e0c19f31d8af2c Thanks!\n  \ud83d\udc4d Given that the tests pass, I think this is good to go.\n  \ud83d\udc4d Sorry for the rebase hassle! This looks good to go.\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Looks good, thanks!\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Reviewed \ud83d\udc4d \n  I'm not sure how, but it looks like those old, squashed commits are still coming along for the ride. I checked your [master branch](https://github.com/duybkict/codecombat/commits/master?author=duybkict) and commits like [`remove nvm`](15a1bcde25dd2a1229066b9ed7ae17321ec6df28) aren't present. Perhaps you branched off `vagrant-box` instead of `master`?\n\nWe're in hairy git territory, so if you want I can either rebase the relevant commits onto our master, or you can keep messing around with git until a pull request just shows the intended commits.\n Now there are more :( See above. The PR should only have those commits which are relevant, which I think are \"organize vagrant scripts\", \"fix bug with passing arguments\", and \"add scripts for brunch\".\n  Should be fixed by 81b550a.\n  Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n  Since I rebased and squashed your previous commits from the branch `vagrant-box` onto [a new commit on master](672c89e0bca913af06349c76bfbb9301edb9f3e3), this branch is now out of sync. I can take the last two commits (organize vagrant scripts, fix bug with passing arguments) and rebase and squash them onto master as well, but you'll need to not make any more changes to this branch, and going forward make new branches off your master. Let me know when the latest commits on this branch are ready for squashing.\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d \n  Just ran `vagrant up`, and it didn't work on my machine (Mac). It ends with this:\n\n```\n==> default: Unpacking mongodb-org-mongos (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Selecting previously unselected package mongodb-org-tools.\n==> default: Preparing to unpack .../mongodb-org-tools_2.6.12_amd64.deb ...\n==> default: Unpacking mongodb-org-tools (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Selecting previously unselected package mongodb-org.\n==> default: Preparing to unpack .../mongodb-org_2.6.12_amd64.deb ...\n==> default: Unpacking mongodb-org (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Processing triggers for man-db (2.6.7.1-1) ...\n==> default: Processing triggers for ureadahead (0.100.0-16) ...\n==> default: ureadahead will be reprofiled on next reboot\n==> default: Setting up mongodb-org-shell (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Setting up mongodb-org-server (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Adding system user `mongodb' (UID 107) ...\n==> default: Adding new user `mongodb' (UID 107) with group `nogroup' ...\n==> default: Not creating home directory `/home/mongodb'.\n==> default: Adding group `mongodb' (GID 113) ...\n==> default: Done.\n==> default: Adding user `mongodb' to group `mongodb' ...\n==> default: Adding user mongodb to group mongodb\n==> default: Done.\n==> default: mongod start/running, process 8811\n==> default: Setting up mongodb-org-mongos (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Setting up mongodb-org-tools (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: Processing triggers for ureadahead (0.100.0-16) ...\n==> default: Setting up mongodb-org (2.6.12) ...\n==> default: start: Job is already running: mongod\nThe SSH command responded with a non-zero exit status.

In that I did `vagrant up`, got the error, did `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up` again to verify and it seemed to download everything anew. This may be because the install process didn't finish? I'm not familiar with the system so I'm not sure what to expect. I've only worked with Docker before, though.\n Got it to work, after cloning the repo anew and running `npm install` before `npm run dev`.

Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n @nwinter\n  The problem with this solution is that it also affects the layout of 'Log In' and 'Create Account' buttons:\n\nfrom\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/13728353/a8ea174a-e90d-11e5-9fbb-2fa17c0af78a.png)\n\nto\n![sem titulo1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/13728354/a8eaea1c-e90d-11e5-88ae-8c8ea25bddcf.png)\n\nMaybe you could add 'margin-left: 10px' to the id 'create-account-btn'.\n  Awesome, @Zeldaretter! Hope you had fun translating these strings :smiley:\n  Great, @jessicaly! Thank you :smile:\n  Thank you, @MaChengxin!\n\nYou can change the order of the words and put then in different strings, as long as the whole sentence makes sense.\n  Great, @mqrelly!\n  @nwinter, can you merge?\n  Thanks, @Maikdani! Good job :+1:\n  Awesome, @MatiasOlivera!

It doesn't have a fixed date, so all there is to do is wait :smile:\n  :+1: Thanks\n  Thank you, @Zeldaretter! Great job\n  As you can see below, the 'Log In' sentence is not correctly centered in its place (it is a bit to the left).\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/13649137/09cbe34a-e634-11e5-92ba-916b2e14198d.png)\n Sorry, I forgot.\n\nFor example, accessing http://codecombat.com/admin/clas without being logged in.\n  Hello, @Agalondia!

It should be great to help new people that don't know how to start :+1:\n  I think I got them all.\n @sderickson, I don't have much experience with tests, and I don't think I'm able to fix them. Can you fix them yourself, please :pray:?\n Ok. I will give it a try then. Thanks for the encouragement :+1:\n From the debugging I made, I found that the change to [line 133](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelLoader.coffee#L133) makes [this test](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/test/app/lib/LevelLoader.spec.coffee#L105) fail and the change to [line 253](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelLoader.coffee#L253) makes [this other test](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/test/app/lib/LevelLoader.spec.coffee#L172) fail. I've tried to change the code, but the tests continue to fail.\n\nI also think I missed some bits in loadModel declaration, but I am unsure about them.\n Yeah, all the tests pass. Want me to revert the changes to those files?\n  In the new homepage, the box to choose the language appears below the titles, which looks a bit weird (only when not logged in, because while logged in, it appears next to them).\n\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/13146477/eb45abc2-d64d-11e5-9dfa-740f93514a15.png)\n\nAlso, the CodeCombat logo redirects to the old home page.\n This is happening on a 1920px wide screen, using latest Chrome in Windows.\n Here (as you can see, there is plenty of space next to the other titles):\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/13199123/3ba6ea28-d814-11e5-85af-baa2f819a11a.png)\n Now, it is only happening in screens <1200px of width.\n There is still a problem with non-English languages. For example, when the language is set to Portuguese (Portugal) and the width is between 1200px and 1223px, including these two, the links go down and the layout looks weird.\n\nWhen the language is set to English, at exactly 1200px, the links go up.\n  Thanks, @Ikuyadeu\n  In the page https://codecombat.com/teachers/quote, if I click the 'Send' button, I get this error:\n- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of undefined\n To get the error, I just click 'Send' without filling any of the boxes (and then check the console).\n\nI'm using the latest Chrome in Windows.\n\nNote: it errors on [this line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/RequestQuoteView.coffee#L87).\n It is working now :+1:\nProbably fixed in f1b046b\n  Good job :+1:\n  Nice, @minwook-shin :+1:\n  Hello, @Ihsara!

Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n No, the failure has nothing to do with the changes you made.\n Sure. When a build runs, some tests are made to the whole code and sometimes, like in this case, some of them fail. But the fail is related to other parts of the code that you didn't touch, so, you did nothing wrong. What failed is listed in https://travis-ci.org/codecombat/codecombat/builds/96595542#L6529. Hope you understand :)\n  Thank you, @javatlacati :+1:\n  Awesome, @micman73!\n  Also, removed duplicated 'Continue' string.\n\nBtw, can't the 'replace('Course :', '')' code be removed, now that the levels don't have it in the name?\n No problem, I found it entertaining :D\n  I tried to accept the translation patch for the achievement (https://codecombat.com/editor/achievement/hold-the-forest-pass-complete) and I got the error:\n\n```\njquery.js:8630 PUT https://codecombat.com/db/patch/57018085f448484b00d9bb83/status 504 ()\nsend    @   jquery.js:8630\najax    @   jquery.js:8166\nt.exports.t.setStatus   @   Patch.coffee:12\nt.exports.t.setStatus   @   Patch.coffee:9\nt.exports.t.acceptPatch @   PatchModal.coffee:69\nr   @   lodash.js:729\ndispatch    @   jquery.js:4435\nv.handle    @   jquery.js:4121\n```\n\nI have admin permissions.\n Additional:\nWhen I tried to accept the patches [here](https://direct.codecombat.com/editor/achievement/bombing-run-complete), I got the same error (504), but texts were changed as it was in the patch.

Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n  Thanks, @tinavincent! Everything looks fine :+1: \n  Got it, thanks!\n  The campaigns not showing up: this issue? https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/3216#issuecomment-160516623\n\nThe database dump restored without errors, right? Is there any content in [http://localhost:3000/db/level/dungeons-of-kithgard](http://localhost:3000/db/level/dungeons-of-kithgard)?\n  I don't have nodemon in my path, no.\n  We could, but I think the solution of iterating over users, even streamed, is now untenable. I'm partial to the earlier suggestion of having a 'refresh' button users can press to run something like that script (updated to use generators?) on just themselves.\n  Fixed by 902c39f?\n Yeah, in commit 1cb8ecf (maybe it is not in br and cn yet?).\n  No longer reproduces.\n  Any better now with the latest update I added today?\n That's weird, I looked up one of the games:\n\nhttp://codecombat.com/play/spectate/zero-sum?session-one=5551d928af92058705a85c18&session-two=5517bbbf5afdf532055761e1\n\nIt happened to be a match between you and Andre95, which ended quickly with no memory buildup. Seems weird that would be one that would crash it.\n\nI need to investigate more...\n Twiddle the volume button a bunch of times for now. More info in [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/need-better-gear-earn-gems-for-simulating-games/2769/35).\n  Fixed, thanks!\n  Good point; we were originally considering Signs and Portents as an alternative to Forgetful Gemsmith, but then it was more difficult, so we use it as a side level now. I've removed the redundant unlocks.\n  I know it's not super intuitive, but you can do the preformatted-text button:\n\n<img width=\"720\" alt=\"screenshot 2015-11-21 16 03 40\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/11321197/8e0b5cf6-9069-11e5-801d-059e8c33866e.png\">\n\nThat indents things by 4 spaces, which is similar to using [code][/code] or ```triple backticks```.\n  Thanks for fixing that!\n  Thanks @viettruong2194 !\n  @sderickson can you review?\n  I did this another way in 69379fb54f7bd6b24d112980a83407b12e973124, since we already have a mechanism for showing player names that I wanted to reuse.\n  Ah, yeah, we did a big refactoring and now URLs with `_` in them instead of `.` (like `level.component`) don't work, so keep your eye out for any that are 404ing because they're formatted wrong.\n  Can you describe a bit more what changes you would want to see for your brother to play?\n  Thanks for the great bug report!\n  Wow, amazing work! Thanks for adding so many strings\u2013such translation stamina!\n  Try the new Courses flow in China instead, which is the intended flow for classrooms: http://cn.codecombat.com/hoc\n  Sorry for the slow response on this, guys. Actually, this one was lurking in a hard-to-find spot: in the snippets section of the findNearestEnemy documentation in the alliance.Allied Component of the Components tab of the level editor online! I've gone and fixed that one up now, so if you clear your cache, you should see the proper `self:findNearestEnemy()` inserted with snippets now.\n\nThanks for noting the bug!\n  Ah, right, we do this because we want the parentheses to be done correctly for you if you are going to go on to do this:\n\n``` coffeescript\nif @distanceTo(target) < 10\n    # ...\n```\n\nParentheses around arguments in CoffeeScript are optional, but you would need them in this case, 'cause otherwise you would have `target < 10` as the argument to `distanceTo`:\n\n``` coffeescript\nif @distanceTo target < 10\n    # ...\n```\n\nAt some point we can explain more about the optional parts of CoffeeScript syntax, when we have the more general programming language articles integrated into the game.\n  Merged it, thanks!\n  Thanks for the heads up, @jlsa; I've fixed the bug and am deploying the fix now.\n  Merged in 8328d955a8b982b9dc50d8c0000df9f730fe2452, but leaving this issue open since as @Imperadeiro98 pointed out, there's more work to be done!\n https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/core/RootView.coffee#L41-L47\n The achievement editor displays an example. You'd need to be on your dev environment and on an 'admin' user, then navigate to `/editor/achievement` and select any achievement there.\n\nYou can also create a test which constructs the view and gives it to `jasmine.demoEl`. Here's an example of how to test and demo a view:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/3ad395ecb80ce56757f1605d00aed1c1cafcfbaf/test/app/views/account/PaymentsView.spec.coffee\n\nYou can see the demo by going here:\n\nhttp://localhost:3000/test/views/account/PaymentsView.spec\n\nAnd clicking 'Show Demos'. I recommend writing tests and setting them up to demo in general, and especially in cases like this where states are hard to reproduce on demand.\n Closing this now that achievements.sass is cleaned up.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/3649\n\nIf more files are found that need cleaning, please open more issues specifically for them, thanks!\n  We need those resources strings; they are loaded by lines like this:\n\n``` coffeescript\n@sessions = @supermodel.loadCollection(new LevelSessionsCollection(), 'your_sessions', {cache: false}, 0).model\n```\n\nCan you update to re-include those?\n\nThe rest look good except I don't know if we were about to put back in the three about teachers selecting languages/progress; @sderickson?\n Sure. In [the SuperModel](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/SuperModel.coffee#L217-L217), the resources to load store their names (which match these i18n strings). Then if the load fails for some reason, the CocoView listening to that resource to load [handles the error](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/core/CocoView.coffee#L154-L175) by creating a loading error message from the [loading error template](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/core/loading-error.jade#L4-L4), which displays this line:\n\n``` jade\nspan(data-i18n=\"resources.#{name}\")\n```\n  Needs its own en.coffee entry and tags, otherwise you will use Josh Lee's title and blurb.\n  Hello, @poshus1984!

Thank you for contributing. Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n  Nice work with reaching the 100%, @javatlacati :+1: \n  Thanks, @Ikuyadeu \n  Almost there (line 258)\n  If you want to translate level related things, just go to http://codecombat.com/i18n, and then find the level you want to translate. By the way, thank you for doing it :+1: \n Which level is it?\n I don't think this is related to translations, is it?\n  Because the game doesn't fit very well on very short screens, we auto-full-screen when going between inventory modal and playing a level if the screen is too small. We only do this once, so if the player doesn't like it, she just has to cancel out one time per session.\n\nIn Safari, though, most keyboard input stops working once in fullscreen, so we don't do this on Safari, using the much-maligned ancient technique of user-agent sniffing. [Here's the code](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L499):\n\n``` coffeescript\n    ua = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase()\n    unless me.isAdmin() or hasGoneFullScreenOnce and (/safari/.test(ua) and not /chrome/.test(ua)) or $(window).height() >= 658  # Min vertical resolution needed at 1366px wide\n      @toggleFullscreen()\n      hasGoneFullScreenOnce = true\n```\n\nSurprise, surprise, it doesn't always work! Have had three bug reports of this in the past couple weeks. But why would people's Safari browsers not pass my `/safari/` test? Anyone able to reproduce by playing in Safari and making your screen less than 656px tall when starting to play a level?\n  Awesome job with the two 100%, @AkaKaras :+1: \n  Thanks, @javatlacati \n  :+1: \n  Thanks, @kchz \n  Thank you, @cwmaia\n  Hello, @NicolasHuang!

Good job\n  We need a better way to draw flowers than to spawn zillions of stateful Thangs. The Ring of Flowers can make things really slow, and it's not obvious why. See [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/game-performance-makes-it-nearly-unplayable-how-can-i-better-my-performance-prevent-freezes/4793) for example.\n  The dotted outlines are pretty faint. At one point I added a red flash to this, but either it's not working or it's not enough, because I've recently gotten several complaints of \"it's not letting me type\" where I confirmed the player didn't see any indication that it was a locked code area.\n\nCode [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L299-L300) and [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level/tome/spell.sass#L166-L183).\n\nAnyone want to take a crack at a better style or effect, or can test whether they see the red pulsate effect? You can test a locked sample code level by going to Haunted Kithmaze on a new anonymous account.\n Just a question: am I supposed to be able to write on the last line of the restricted code area? If not, it is allowing me to do so.\n Hmm, it shouldn't let you write inside the dotted lines...\n It lets me write after the last character of the sample code.\n\nExample from Haunted Kithmaze:\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/9613255/2f992fb6-50e2-11e5-9b00-7d0c2dc78fde.png)\n  I just realized that we field a lot of support from players trying to beat difficult levels (optional challenges, multiplayer arenas, repeatable brawls, etc.) that are actually optional levels, but they don't realize it, and they think that they need to do this level to continue, even though the main track levels are much easier and they just want to keep going.\n\nMy first thoughts on how to fix this:\n1. Make the core level dots look different: a new color?\n2. Have our illustrator modify all the world maps to actually include a single main path and side branches where our levels actually go, so that it's visually obvious which way is forward.\n3. Cheaper than 2: have illustrator add a line along the current hacky layout of the main path in each world map.\n\nOther ideas? What do you guys think?\n  Thanks for contributing!

Glad to see you again :)\n  I like the transition to help it become visible, but instead of having it blend in and be out of the way, we kind of want it to be blatantly obvious and close enough to the action so that the player notices it, since the main problem we currently have is that it's hard to find.\n @sderickson What do you think about proposed changes to the save button\u2013did you have alternative designs?

Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in?\n  Thanks @gnerkus!\n I think the tests have been failing for another reason. I suppose I should have to check it out soon.\n  I agree with your reasoning and vaguely remember intending to have something like `moveToXY`, `moveToward`, `moveToXY`, and `moveToward`, where the XY versions are used earlier in the game when explaining more complicated syntax would be a burden, transitioning cleanly to the one-argument versions when object literals are introduced. I either forgot to rename things like that or had some other reason I've now forgotten not to do it.\n\nThen people persuaded me that the higher-level boots should have both `move` and `moveXY` on them instead of just `move` so that they don't error out when playing the earlier levels, mostly. So if we kept that idea and expanded and renamed now, we'd end up with all four versions. I guess we can get rid of `moveTowardXY` if we want to save one, since incremental moving is taught after object literals.\n\nI don't want to just use the XY version, since that makes things like `self.move(item.pos)` harder than it needs to be. And we do introduce the `Vector` class in the glacier, where the player is making her own Vectors and moving to them, so it's also less convenient to split a Vector into two arguments again just to move toward it there.\n\nThe Vector solution doesn't help too much with the non-Pythonicity of using a dict, though, because we don't have time to introduce Vectors until deep into the game.\n\nAll told, we were doing it again from scratch, I'd of course want to do it differently, but the workable improvement (making `moveToward`, `moveToXY`, and `moveTo`) seems messy enough that I don't think it's worth the trouble of migrating everything.\n  Thanks, @spkane! Could you move the locale string from en-US.coffee to en.coffee, and uncomment it? en.coffee is the source of all things, whereas en-US.coffee is basically vestigial.\n  Thanks @spkane! What do you think of the current status of the Vagrant setup?\n  Hi @LePetitRenard; thanks for adding those names! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Also, can you update this so that the names are alphabetized? (Helps from adding duplicate names.)\n Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla), please? Thanks!\n  Right, we just forgot to get the paper doll art done for the hammers.\n  It actually gives you the difference in gems between what level 3 was worth and what level 2 was worth, but shows the total gems awarded for the level. I should fix this to make it more clear that you get the difference each time.\n  Hi @kidaa, it seems like this might just changing line encodings on these files or something? What's the part that you want added here?\n  I think usability is better for links that underline on hover when 1) the link isn't already blue (here it's white) and 2) the users aren't all sophisticated web users (here there are a lot of kids). So I don't think this fits; sorry!\n  Thanks for adding those translations, @j8r!\n  Great! Thanks for taking care of that.\n  Hmm, can you explain a bit more what you mean?\n  Yeah, it does sound like an Aether bug, possibly to do with API protection acting up.\n I wonder if it's a yielding issue; in your original code, if you don't add `this.say('hello');` afterward, does it end up saying the last enemy type?\n I mean, you'd have to test that in CodeCombat, because that's where `say()` and the concept of game time passing might come into play, along with the conditional yielding. If it's not an API protection bug, it could just be that yields aren't working inside the forEach callback.\n\nYou can add the `yieldsConditionally: true` option to the Aether options to see what that would transpile to.\n We are currently using traceur to turn generators into ES5, but we only do it to player code, not any library code. I'd like to not use it any further than I have to, as it's a gnarly dependency and makes things huge. So it'd be nice not to have to override the native functions with generators, as then that just spreads the boundary of where we need to be transpiling to ES5. Plus, there are a lot of native functions that would need to be rewritten (not just the JS ones, but the Python ones, Clojure ones, etc.)\n\nI think it'd be better to more cleverly figure out where we are passing functions to other functions when we aren't able to modify them to deal with the generatorification so that we can do it, even if yielding doesn't work inside the passed function (usually you don't need to yield in it, because you're not taking some blocking action in there\u2013it'd just be nice to have the passed function run).\n  So smart! I love having your fresh eyes on things; of course that's the case for rings. Thanks for just cutting straight through all the delirium around that!\n ... I love you. Also, to show my love, I have laid out a stunning repast of delicious issues on this issue tracker for you to feast upon.\n  From #4123:\r\n> When typing any text into an article editor box, I get a red error box at the top that says this (below).

Thanks for spotting that.\n  Nice work! Yeah, the need to restrict every other ring in order to truly require the Ring of Flowers is still an issue, but another one; this is definitely better than the way it was before.\n  Ah, mine did the same thing. Will have to do a tiny bit of hackery to stop this from happening. I will move the issue to the level editor checklist for that level.\n  Ah, let's keep it open until I fix that error message. (Again\u2013I could have sworn I had it, but maybe I didn't get all the cases. Anyway, it's really easy to reproduce, so it's silly that I thought I fixed it.)\n  Here's [one example](http://codecombat.com/play/level/dueling-grounds?session=54f17cfb8d380d7f05acd58d&team=humans&dev=true&opponent=5516b73d4d24212f05944f7c). Doesn't matter what code the player uses, Arryn errors out immediately: `Cannot redefine property: throwPos`. I don't know why this is happening, but it seems possible that it is something to do with the opponent having the razor disc and Arryn having that as part of her hero. Need to debug further and maybe come up with a simpler test case.\n  Thanks @laituan245!\n  Thanks @laituan245!\n  Great\u2013nice work! I love it when things can be made simpler like that.\n  It seems like that should work fine; can you submit a pull request to Aether to replace the https:// with the git:// in that package.json?\n  Wow, awesome! You can use the CoffeeScript fat arrow `=>` instead of `->` to get rid of the `tempThis`. Also, don't use `this` in CoffeeScript, use `@` (at least to match our style).\n  Probably a good confirmation step; one long-time user asked for this after his account was deleted (a horrific tragedy).\n Right! You can put \"Fixes #2842\" in your commit message and it will automatically close the issue when the PR is merged in, too by th way.\n  Wow, you did the whole thing in one go! Amazing! Thank you so much!\n\nNot that there really needs to be a next time, since you did it all :) \u2013 but if you do translate any more, you can also uncomment each line by removing the `#` at the beginning like I just did in 339aaa0.\n  Can you check out the memory usage in Chrome's task manager for that tab as it gets toward the point where it crashes?\n  Fixed; invisibility and hide, when stacked, weren't reverting to an unhidden state properly. Now each cancels the other correctly when first applied.\n  Great! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  In the programming.UsesSnippets Component, we need to add to its config schema the modulo \"concept\", and also we need to add to its settings the documentation for that. If anyone's looking for an easy Scribe task that can be done just straight up in the level editor, they can get us started here!\n\nhttp://direct.codecombat.com/editor/level/tiny\n\n![screenshot 2015-06-14 14 14 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/8150454/ac97d1c4-129f-11e5-9def-9e9083f7e96d.png)\n I think the process described here is still mostly up to date: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/399\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/two-rings-of-speed/3847/2):\n\n> In my inventory screen in Clash of Clones, I have two Rings of Speed on my hands.

See also #2740.\n  Thanks @Kavignon!\n  On [Haunted Kithmaze](http://codecombat.com/play/level/haunted-kithmaze?dev=true), this code works:\n\n``` lua\nloop\n    self:moveRight()\n    self:moveRight()\n    self:moveUp()\n    self:moveUp()\nend\n```\n\nThis doesn't:\n\n``` lua\nloop\n    self:moveRight(2)\n    self:moveUp(2)\nend\n```\n\nSomething to do with AnnouncesAction firing for latter code and not the former, and it takes 1s to `say`, during which the hero is sliding and hits the spikes. But AnnouncesAction shouldn't take time on its `say`, so that's weird. Also, it only seems to happen in Lua. And only when you are slow enough.\n\n... yay\n  This is where the sound is played: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelLoader.coffee#L409-L416\n\n[AudioPlayer](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/AudioPlayer.coffee) should be respecting volume, but maybe it isn't? We could just not play the jingle if we know the player's volume is 0.\n  Maybe just because of Zero Sum, or some other level, and then it stays equipped because it is invisible?\n  Thanks @nemoyatpeace!\n  @sderickson Do we have a way to fix this? As I recall, we were frustrated by patches getting messed up when the Thangs order changed (which happens frequently), but I don't know if there was an additional chunk of work that we could do to make it function anyway.\n  Let's just change the description, since people have set up a bunch of levels with the 0 value.\n  Thank you, @probil\n  Thanks, @aliceinwire!\n  Thanks, @Lego3!

Awesome job :)\n  Yeah, maybe let's have just one Vagrant page, with subsections for any OS-specific differences if needed, and then we can organize the links\u2013thanks for any help with this! @popey456963 feel free to advise if you know more about what we were going for here.\n  I don't want to whitelist items, because there are so many items to whitelist and it'll inevitably be someone's badass sword that we just added and they just bought and they can't use, which is not a good feeling for the player. Special-casing the ring slot here seems to be a better idea; we could even do something hacky and special case the Ring of Flower itself, since so far we haven't had to ever require any other rings.\n  Thank you, @Vic020\n  Hello, @Lego3!

Could you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n  Hmm. The timeout is already 7.5 seconds. Is it really going to be fun to play if your code is taking significantly longer than that? Runtimes will expand to fill whatever limits we put, but I don't know if it'll actually make for a better gameplay experience.\n\nWhat kind of preprocessing are you working on?\n Sure, share the code\u2013pastebin? Interesting approach.\n\nWe could make some obstacle data available on high-end sense-stones. What kind of methods/properties do you think would make sense?\n Ah, I see. Yeah, that's just running very slowly (even though it doesn't end up being too-too many statements; presumably whatever the transpiler is doing to it is making parts of it very expensive).\n\nI'm guessing that even if we made this work better in terms of yielding CPU and not triggering the infinite loop detector, it still wouldn't get us up to, say, 5x better before you also started seeing too many out-of-memory crashes and just horribly slow performance. And it's pretty complicated to do, when most of the time we should probably be making the timeout shorter to rescue our less-advanced players from infinite loops.\n\nI did have a way to do most of what you suggested when we were doing chooseAction methods instead of plan methods, where we didn't have to do the automatic yielding, but that wouldn't be easy to port over to our generator-based approach.\n\nDo you think you'd have a much easier time getting this to run performantly if a sense-stone gave you a 1-meter-resolution grid which told you where all the obstacles were?\n  Now they do!\n  I know these names... ;)\n\nCan I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) _(fixed)_ so I can merge these in? Thanks!\n Oops, sorry about that!\n  Hello, @YukiUeda! Thank you for contributing.\n  Unless we changed something recently with this, I'm guessing that the player actually had a different email address that has all the progress (different from the two we know about) and just signed up with this latest email, which created a new account. The account he is mentioning was created this morning, so I know it's not the right account. He would need to remember the email or username he used for the original account.\n  The \"Accepted Payment Methods\" pop-up can't be closed without closing the whole subscribe window.\n\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/7260662/909753e8-e863-11e4-9923-15d9bc754a87.png)\n  When I'm in the page of a clan that I own I can't neither edit the name of the clan nor its description.

Additionally, since the leaderboards contain links to view the solutions, I don't want to show the leaderboards until the player has already done it herself. (Well, I guess we could add some logic to not show replay links until the player had done it.)\n\nWhy do we need a leaderboard button before the player has beaten the level?\n  I don't know of a way to fix things like Internet Download Manager trying to interfere with our normal web requests. You probably just want to turn off IDM while playing CodeCombat.\n  Thanks @robertbeuligmann! I got a chance to test this out, and it seems like it works great.

Except that in my test on [`effects.HasEffects`](http://localhost:3000/i18n/component/haseffects), `workingSchema` is always `{}`, and even if it was filled in, wouldn't it be `workingSchema.properties` instead of `workingSchema.props`?\n\n[CocoModel updateI18NCoverage](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/CocoModel.coffee#L400):\n\n``` coffeescript\n        # use it to determine what properties actually need to be translated\n        props = workingSchema.props or []\n        props = (prop for prop in props when parentData[prop])\n```\n\nHow are we supposed to get the proper working schema to look for properties?\n\nI was going to add this so that if there are no properties to translate (because any properties we have are actually just empty strings and so don't need translations), we mark the language as covered:\n\n``` coffeescript\n        unless props.length\n          langCodeArrays.push _.without _.keys(locale), 'update'  # Every language has covered a path with no properties to be translated.\n          return\n```\n\nOtherwise we get a lot of things marked as not covered when there are default `\"'` values in schemas:\n\n![screenshot 2015-04-06 08 54 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/7007000/b52639d4-dc3a-11e4-9c35-2473e6bf1605.png)\n I guess `props` is what each `i18n` property calls its array of properties to translate.

Nice translations you have been committing.\n  Thank you, @javatlacati! Nice job.\n  A player had a super great idea for helping other players understand when their code is and isn't within blocks (like if, else, loop, etc.):\n\n> Maybe you could add a hint, such as line coloring, to group the statements with the \"if\" line together, and a different color for the \"else\" line and its statements?\n\nWe should be able to do some fun stuff with Ace overlays to make it really easy to see when your indentation or brackets are not right and when they are, so that it becomes much easier to understand how blocks work.\n If the background/border colors we use are sequential, partially transparent, or alternating based on scope depth, it should take care of itself. There are other ways, too, but we'll have to come up with a basic visual design before we know what we're going to do with overlapping blocks.\n  I just implemented it so that the `\"attack\"` and `\"defend\"` commands will be remembered until the next command, but the logic is pretty complicated, so try it out and let me know how it goes.\n  Got it, thanks!

Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n  Oh my, I can't believe it took me this long to find it, but there were two versions of the fourth level (Forgetful Gemsmith versus Signs and Portents), and one of them didn't even give you the simple sword! So depending on which one you did, you would only fake-own the sword when it was required in some level, but you wouldn't always be able to equip it properly.\n\nI've now added the sword to both versions.

Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n No problem.\n  When the level asks me to buy the Tarnished Bronze Breastplate, it also makes me equip it. Then, when the level reloads, I already have it equipped, but there appears a tip that tells me to equip it.\n Can anyone else reproduce this? It seems to go away properly for me when following the normal flow.\n Seems like it is fixed now.\n I still can't reproduce. After the page reloads with the new breastplate equipped, the script is gone.\n  Unclear if this is causing functional problems, but it has in other areas for us in the past.\nhttp://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays\n\n![ie9createjsfloat32array](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/6446907/23f0942e-c0c3-11e4-928d-1bf49807bd0e.png)\n  I changed it to rewrite the default code if you are using the more-advanced glasses, so I think most of the frustration is gone. I do still want to encourage players to transition to the composed function method of doing it.\n  Nice job, @nixel2007! It will be great. In fact, when I translate to pt-PT I always need to check en.coffee, so it will be a nice change.\n\nNote: @popey456963, you will also need to change https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Scribe-Home#sample-workflow, I think.\n  I can't find another issue for it now, but also there's [this one](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/achievement-design-change/3492/4):\n\n![](http://virtual-host-discourse.global.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/codecombat/_optimized/a27/ba0/b306de915a_690x421.jpg)\n  See [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/simulation-improvements/3285). We need to get away from uneven `-submitDate` queries and get a better random distribution. @schmatz suggested:\n\n> We can build similar in-memory data structures to support such operations in our app servers. We could preload the IDs of sessions to simulate into some array and randomly pick among them and refresh at some regular interval.\n  Hmm, can't reproduce; let me know if you see it again, and if you do, check the JS console for any fun error messages in there. Thanks!\n  Some more thoughts on this over here on the forum: http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/notepad/3478/3\n  Can you list which ones? It might be that they haven't been created, or perhaps it's that they are premium subscriber only and can't be opened in the level editor (although it should give you a nice \"forbidden\" message if so, so maybe we need to hook one up if that didn't happen).\n  Thanks @kojoidrissa!\n  Thanks @laituan245!\n  You can do that in any level with the simple boots, but we don't want the players to have to worry about that kind of complexity at first, so it's only introduced in the premium levels (which do explain it). I want the docs to be as simple as possible before then, so I don't want to talk about arguments in those docs.\n  Good names\u2013thanks for adding them!\n\nCan you [sign our CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge these in? (It's easy.)\n  You can just commit to your branch and the changes will appear here.\n  Haha, I love these names. Nice! Thanks for adding those.\n\nCan you [sign our CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge these in? (It's easy.)\n  That's a good idea. I didn't want to switch to new translation keys and lose the old translations for minor changes like this, where the old translated string is better than no string, but adding comments automatically indicating a change could be good. I don't know how easy it would be to pull off, though.\n  At the moment the [account page](http://codecombat.com/account) is looking quite bland when compared with how sleek the rest of the interface is.  \n![](http://i.imgur.com/aZ5QImV.png)\n  Thank you, @nixel2007! Always fast.\n  1. Go to http://localhost:3000/editor/level/dungeons-of-kithgard\n2. Click Systems -> Existence\n3. Paste your code here.\n\nAlso, does your rand.coffee initializer match this one exactly with how it references `@seed` and not `seed` throughout the constructor? https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/rand.coffee#L1-L11\n  Oh my! That's quite nice. Although that is exactly what lightning bolts do in real life, our game should have Game Balance. ;) I'll fix it.\n  We used to have to have code like this for Lua, since we had no simple `loop` keyword, and so we had to help the player avoid infinite loops:\n\n``` lua\nwhile true do\n    -- whatever the sample code is\n\n    self:say(\"Remove this line once your loop is finite.\")\nend\n```\n\nNow we can rewrite that to:\n\n``` lua\nloop\n    -- whatever the sample code is\nend\n```\n\n(The simple loop will automatically yield for one frame if no action is taken, so you can't get an infinite loop by not doing `move`, `attack`, `say`, or some other blocking action.)\n\nWe need to update the Lua sample code in pretty much all levels to use the new `loop` keyword instead, and to get rid of the placeholder `say` lines. The first few levels have no loops, and some of the last ones in the desert actually are teaching `while true do` loops, and some levels have just comments for sample code, but everything else will need updating.\n\nTo update the Lua sample code:\n1. Open the level editor\n2. Double-click the Hero Placeholder\n3. Click programming.Programmable on the left\n4. Open `programmableMethods` -> `plan` -> `languages` -> `lua`\n5. Update the Lua sample code.\n6. Submit a patch\n7. Post (or update) your comment here saying which ones you've done.\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-27 14 22

A bunch of the remaining levels might be because they're paid levels, and I guess maybe the level editor doesn't let you open those. But there are still some free ones left that either need doing or need a heads up that they don't need simple loops in them.\n  I usually run it like this:\n\n```\ncoffee scripts/copy-i18n-tags.coffee\n```\n\nThat way I don't have to switch directories. It would be good to make it able to run from anywhere, but failing that, I want it to at least work from a current working directory of the root CodeCombat directory.\n  We are tracking a user's playtime on any level in her LevelSession: `session.get('playtime')` (seconds). A user requested to see that at the end of the level. I thought it'd be kind of cool. If we think of somewhere to put it in, it should be subtle, though.\n\nMaybe in the leaderboards, or victory screen, or on the level info popover you get when clicking on a level from the CampaignView?\n  Thinking about this some more, I just realized that we should put these required levels into the Level itself, so that the code can't get out of sync with the data. What if we added an option to have a number instead of a boolean for `disableSpaces` and `lockDefaultCode`, and then we could fill these expected levels in the Campaign Editor instead of just using `true` and then overriding it later?\n\nWe could edit [this schema](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/schemas/models/level.coffee#L310-L310):\n\n```\ndisableSpaces: { type: ['boolean', 'integer'] }\nlockDefaultCode: { type: ['boolean', 'integer'] }\n```\n\n... and then update the SpellView code to also be able to handle the `me.level()` comparison if it's a number instead of just `true`. What do you think?\n You updated the schema and it still wouldn't let you change it? Can you post a screenshot of that not working in the CampaignEditor?\n Ohhh, I see. We also need to update the schema here, too:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/schemas/models/campaign.schema.coffee#L64-L64\n\n(Because the CampaignEditor denormalizes it, the same property is in two places.)\n  Player reported that this code crashed his tab in Peasant Protection:\n\n``` javascript\n//return;  //Commented out to stop infinite loop.\nloop {\n    var enemy = this.findNearestEnemy();\n    var distance = this.distanceTo(enemy);\n    if (distance < 10) {\n        // Attack if they get too close to the peasant.\nthis.cleave(enemy); \nthis.cleave(enemy);\nelse this.shield(enemy){\n\n}\n    }\n    // Else, stay close to the peasant! Use else.\n\n\n}\n```\n\nNot sure exactly which part is blowing it up\u2013the missing close-brace before the else, the bad order on the opening brace and the statement after the else, or what may be interpreted as an extra close brace at the end. But drilling down, it looks like this does a similar thing, so it's probably the ending close brace in whatever parse_dammit makes of our mashed-up AST:\n\n``` javascript\nloop {\n    var enemy = this.findNearestEnemy();\n}\n}\n```\n\nAlso, it does trigger our hard execution limit:\n\n> Hero Placeholder had new Programmable problem: plan Hard execution limit of 1000000 exceeded.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to be enough to recover. Maybe we need to adjust how the hard execution limit is fired for plan()-based methods?\n  Thanks @h3yduck!\n  Can you post a screenshot of the busted text? If there's no shorter translation that would fit, we can apply some language-specific styling to lower the text size, as we did in #2408.\n You would want to change it to $ USD, because we don't know what the Euro price would be; Stripe figures that out dynamically.\n\nSure, I'd be happy to review a pull request changing the layout. Thank you!\n  Nice work, thanks @laituan245.\n  In addition to [locking down default code](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L262-L262) and [disabling the space bar](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L223-L223) when the level options suggest we should, for the early levels, we should only do it when the player isn't higher level than we expect. If a level 15 player comes in to do dungeon level 3, of course we don't need to lock the default code. This is an easy check to do.\n\nWe need to look at `me.level()` and figure out what level a player would be when doing these levels in order. If the player is at least a few levels higher than expected, we shouldn't lock sample code / disable spaces, even if the level options suggest we should.\n  Thank you for contributing, @angryelven-jdd!\n  Thank you, @ChaosCat!\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/coinucopia-screen-freezes-after-submit/2847):\n\n> When I press the submit button to run in real time, the screen freezes and I can't get it past [the countdown screen].\n> \n> I'm running IE9 on Win7 and learning the Python language - all the other levels have worked so far.\n\nStrange that this would fail if other real-time playback levels right before it didn't, but suggests that we might be able to fix it. New thing in Coinucopia is, of course, flags.\n This could be the same thing as #2000.\n Confirmed Coinucopia real-time playback broken on Win7 IE9.  After clicking Submit, I see a 2.. countdown and then am immediately returned to the coding view.\n\nThere were a few script errors in the JS console:\n![ie9float32arrayproblem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/6446421/f7b08886-c0bf-11e4-8117-b95545df27f6.png)\n Lurkers loaded fine on Win7 IE9.\n  Nice!\n  Thanks @amankr!\n  Hi, @divyanshu013!

And I think the error is not related with your changes.\n  Thanks for adding those translations, @Melondonut!\n  This would be kind of complicated to pull off flexibly, because we delete the `damage` Component config property (which it would have picked up) and move it to the `spells['lightning-bolt'].damage` when we attach it to the Thang (which we of course aren't doing in this docs view).\n\nBut as a quick workaround for the spells, maybe we can implement a quick workaround that kind of infers that it should remove the `spells['whatever'].` in these sort of strings and just look if `damage` is in the Component config (which we actually do have loaded).\n  Got it, thanks! Actually the mine was blowing the player up into the air into the coin for another mine, I think.\n  Let's try using the particle system to keep showing something around them even when they are unlocked. We would adjust [this logic](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/CampaignView.coffee#L331-L338).\n\nBy the way, the particle system is only enabled in Chrome right now, because it seemed to cause problems in all the other browsers in our A/B tests even after handling all the errors we knew about from WebGL support problems.\n  Let's try using the particle system to keep showing something around them even when they are unlocked.

E.g. if I'm on level 5, there might be a little 5 on the flag in the world view.\n  Also works great\u2013thanks for fixing that!\n  Thank you, @Coderaulic.\n\nRegarding line breaks, I don't know if they are possible. Why would you need to use them?\n Just tried it out, and although we aren't able to make that sort of line break happen just with the translations, you can put <br> or other HTML in a translation if it is used along with `data-i18n=\"[html]home.play\"` like in 88c55fa. \n  Hehe, good thinking. We'll just cover up any non-harmonious math. ;)\n  Hello, @etem! Thanks you for the translations.\n Because of line 9, for example (but I've [fixed](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/6afad49d8f7f74462c79e32e2f51bac2c13e191e) it now).\n  Hi, @musicogeek! Thank you for contributing.\n  Thanks, @ITz7! Nice work on Chinese languages.\n  Hello, @ITz7! Thank you a lot for your contribution. Awesome job!\n  @coder0xff it looks like some of the assertions in these two test cases failed: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/test/app/lib/world/ellipse.spec.coffee#L10-L35\n\nThis is the Travis CI output: https://travis-ci.org/codecombat/codecombat/builds/51791907#L1996-L2028\n\nWe can probably get your dev server working so you can run the tests and maybe we can figure out what's going wrong with the new containsPoint.\n If you commit to the same branch, the change will appear in this one (as indeed happened).\n  Thanks @divyanshu013, who knew it'd be so easy? :)\n  Hi, @etem! Thank you for contributing.\n\nNote: Next time, could you remove the # before your translations so that they actually take effect (you don't need to fix it this time, because I'll take care of it).\n No problem.\n  That's great\u2013thanks to you and @divyanshu013 for tracking that down!\n  Awesome job, @Coderaulic! Keep it up!\n  First step would be to test it in production to make sure the bug actually exists.  Then you should go check whether being away for a short while actually matters.  If it does, unsure, if it doesn't, you'll need to make a change to the corrector.  \n  Ah, works great\u2013nice work!\n  Thanks for keeping it tidy!\n  @schmatz tells me that in order to get text search working again in MongoDB 3.0 release candidate, we need:\n1. Remove the dependency on mongoose-text-search (which can be found by grepping \"textSearch\")\n2. Ensure the correct index(es) are placed\n3. Rewrite the calls to textSearch to just be find calls [like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24714166/full-text-search-with-weight-in-mongoose)\n Working on this now.\n Also, the tests related to this should be updated (they are not passing).\n  Someone emailed me to say:\n\n> There is an orthographical mistake in russian version of CodeCombat; in description of shields we can see this word: \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442. But according to rules of the russian language, it would be correct to write \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442.\n\nI am not really sure which strings he's talking about, might be in the item descriptions for some (all?) shields? @nixel2007 if you have a moment, would you mind checking it out?\n Great, thanks!\n  Great work, @ChaosCat! It's awesome that you're seeing this demand. I think your translations will help a ton of players!\n Sure!\n  Hello, @leotada! Thank you for contributing. Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n  Thank you, @enricpc!\n  Wow, this is really great! I asked @sderickson and he suggested that instead of just deleting the User object, we should remove all the properties except for _id, and maybe also add a `deleted: true` property, so that we can return HTTP 410 Gone codes when a user is deleted. Care to update this to include that?\n I don't think we need to implement the 410 now if we don't want, but I think the intent is to modify the `getById` database handler to return a HTTP 410 \"Gone\" error code instead of an HTTP 404 \"Not found\" error code [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/commons/Handler.coffee#L214-L214) if we know that this is a deleted record. In that sense it might be easier to add a `deleted` property, because then it doesn't need custom logic specific to the User schema to determine what might mean that the model has been deleted, and we can use it for other models as well if we want a placeholder to indicate that there was once a model there.\n Excellent work! Thanks @laituan245!\n  Hello, @sohalya! Thank you for contributing. Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n  Thank you, @ChaosCat!\n Not that I know. You will have to wait until it is live.\n  Heard this from a user; haven't tried to reproduce myself.\n Anyone have easy access to an IE9 machine and can report whether this level worked or what the problem was?\n Works on Win7 IE9 in Python and CoffeeScript.\n  Awesome, thanks for fixing that!\n  Thanks, @ChaosCat!\n  Thank you, @vampirelower!\n  But that would just be the same as playing the level... Do you think it should let you just play the level from the leaderboard view?\n  Some [details in the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/browser-question-was-crash-crash-crash-venting/2760/3). Catsync also mentioned that it crashes a lot when using the level editor in both an older MacBook and a new iMac, in Chrome (I forget if it was also in Firefox or if Firefox was just slow).\n  Thanks, @divyanshu013!\n  Thank you, @ChaosCat!\n  Thank you, @wakeup!\n  Ah, nice work!

Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n  Thanks @divyanshu013!\n  It's ordered to what I originally thought the popularity would be, based on some old analytics data from before we actually had any translations, plus keeping related languages together.\n\nI could see going for alphabetization, but I could also see for just updating it to be in order of real CodeCombat popularity now. It's not very convenient for those languages lower on the list, and I wouldn't want to put Chinese (zh) or Russian (ru) all the way toward the bottom when we have so many players needing to choose those, especially since English locale code alphabetization isn't as easily grokked by some players using different character sets.\n\n@Imperadeiro98 @nixel2007 @ArthurLu @mogsie @Martin005 what do you guys think about ordering by popularity versus ordering by alphabetical versus some other ordering?\n I agree with @Martin005! It would be nice if it was ordered according to CodeCombat popularity, plus everyone could see if they have many people playing from their country.\n It seems like we all agree :)\n Here are the language popularities for registered users:\n\n```\n74.20%  en-US\n5.04%   zh-HANS\n4.77%   ru\n3.98%   es-ES\n2.91%   fr\n1.11%   en-GB\n0.90%   pt-PT\n0.84%   es-419\n0.74%   ja\n0.69%   de-DE\n0.65%   pl\n0.61%   zh-HANT\n0.41%   nl-NL\n0.29%   it\n0.28%   ko\n0.21%   hu\n0.19%   th\n0.18%   sv\n0.18%   tr\n0.18%   pt-BR\n0.17%   uk\n0.14%   da\n0.14%   ro\n0.13%   cs\n0.10%   en-AU\n0.10%   id\n0.10%   vi\n0.09%   bg\n0.09%   ar\n0.09%   nb\n0.09%   fi\n0.07%   sk\n0.07%   el\n0.06%   he\n0.04%   lt\n0.03%   ca\n0.03%   sl\n0.03%   de-AT\n0.02%   nl-BE\n0.01%   sr\n0.01%   nl\n0.01%   fa\n0.01%   es\n0.00%   de-CH\n0.00%   ms\n0.00%   hi\n0.00%   zh-WUU-HANS\n0.00%   pt\n0.00%   nn\n0.00%   zh-WUU-HANT\n0.00%   de\n0.00%   gl\n0.00%   ms-BA\n0.00%   ur\n0.00%   mk-MK\n```\n\nFollowing (with difficulty) a similar alphabetization scheme to what Wikipedia's language sidebar uses, and keeping similar language groups together, then gives us 93.56% coverage with the top five language families (which is actually 8 choices):\n\n```\nEnglish (US)\nEnglish (UK)\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\nespa\u00f1ol (ES)\nespa\u00f1ol (Am\u00e9rica Latina)\nfran\u00e7ais\n------------------------\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a\nCatal\u00e0\n\u010ce\u0161tina\nDansk\nDeutsch (Deutschland)\nDeutsch (Schweiz)\nDeutsch (\u00d6sterreich)\n\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\nGalego\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\nBahasa Indonesia\nItaliano\n\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\nJ\u0119zyk polski\nLietuvi\u0173 kalba\nLimba rom\u00e2n\u0103\nMagyar\n\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\n\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0915 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940\nBahasa Melayu\nNederlands (Belgi\u00eb)\nNederlands (Nederland)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\nNorsk bokm\u00e5l\nNorsk nynorsk\nPortugu\u00eas (Portugal)\nPortugu\u00eas Do Brasil\n\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\nSloven\u010dina\nSloven\u0161\u010dina\nSuomi\nSvenska\n\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\nTi\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0432\u0430\n\u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648\n\u5434\u8bed\n\u5433\u8a9e\n```\n\nWe can probably delete English (AU), especially since we do very little localization for flavors of English. The biggest loser would be pt-PT, which is the 7th-most-popular individual language, but which would be down in spot #36. But overall, it's much better. Cool?\n  If my hero is equipped with many items and I start removing them with double-click, then, if I happen to remove an item that is necessary to that particular level, I can no longer keep removing the other items by double-clicking them.\n I'd start by tracing [the handlers in InventoryModal](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L23-L38) to see what events should be firing and aren't firing, or are being stopped by some condition where they shouldn't be.\n  Ah, very nice! We might have to come up with a slightly tweaked design to gain a little bit more bottom margin on the heroes that also have skill lines, but this is a definite improvement. Thanks!\n  Right! The problem is that the `isMultiplayer` check is wrong, since we have teams defined for many sessions now: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/LevelSession.coffee#L41-L41\n\nNot exactly what it should be instead, but something better than just the `team` check. Maybe only when there is `submittedCode`? Won't show them up as multiplayer until the players submit at least once, but that's better than this.\n\nI guess I'l just try that.\n I have not deployed to production yet, no.\n Have you submitted the multiplayer games to the ladder? Which levels aren't showing up that should, and what's your username? I'll check it out.\n  Here's an example of how to reduce per-language font sizes when text doesn't fit:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/home.sass#L86-L89\n\nWe could do this here for French, or for all non-English languages to be safer, or we could come up with a better way of finding the right font size for a given button and text string.\n  Thanks, @ZeAntwan! Could you open an [issue](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/new) for line 417?\n  Hello, @ZeAntwan! Nice work! Thanks for contributing.\n  Ah, right! I will avoid doing that in the future; thanks for catching that.\n  Hi, @laituan245! Good job. Keep it up!\n  I think we will have to do it more flexibly than this, unfortunately. (I mentioned in HipChat a few of the problems I found with this approach, like the possibility for popovers getting squashed on the right or covering up the blue dialogue on the left.)\n  You're totally right about this. All the next seven heroes coming up (the most powerful ones) are non-white, including two black heroes. (It would be better if we'd realized this sooner to include more diverse heroes early on, but we weren't thinking.) Will close this when they are in the game.\n They are coming:\n\n![new_heroes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/7093323/052594b8-df6d-11e4-9800-83ed7d86dd03.png)\n  Hah, I love it! Nice!\n  Hi, @ArthurLu! Great job, as always!\n  Ah, this is great\u2013really nice work on this!\n  Hello, @gutierri! Thank you for your contribution.\n  Hi, @jimmysvk! Thank you! The problem was the indentation in line 297.\n  I see the problem; I've fixed it with a more permissive schema. Sorry about that! I'm deploying the fix now, so should be live in 20-60 minutes depending on caching.\n Just [this](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/a8dc353f86a0bdf6951d48a26fbb9714f006bbe6#diff-f460cba2d34c2a08a6a264bbfbfe0164R289). I don't really care about the data type that gets stored in here, as it's only for visual debugging purposes anyway.\n  Hello, @ArthurLu! Awesome job! Is your goal 100%?\n Nice! Thanks to you and others, people that speak Traditional Chinese will be able to play in their mother language.\n  These are very good suggestions, thanks!  We're hoping that non-English speakers will still be able to keepup because our localization is coming on [very well](https://codecombat.com/contribute/diplomat).  I do think that there are a few too many things happening on the first level, and I'll tag this as an enhancement.\n  We have a patch acceptance interface in the Article Editor, like this:\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-12 13 24 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/6177327/9619b920-b2ba-11e4-87f2-eef684747f22.png)\n\nThe code for that starts [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/article/ArticleEditView.coffee#L67-L68) and [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/editor/article/edit.jade#L26-L27).\n\nWe need a similar thing for the Achievement Editor, which has no way yet of accepting all its pending i18n patches:\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-12 13 26 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/6177355/d052dffe-b2ba-11e4-9d0a-268a680dec14.png)\n Looks like [the PatchesCollection only knows how to fetch patches for versioned models](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/collections/PatchesCollection.coffee#L9-L9) (the ones that have the `original` property). Maybe something like this will work for using `_id` instead, for non-versioned documents where the `original` value just would be the same as `_id` (since the single Achievement document _is_ the original):\n\n``` coffeescript\n    identifier = if forModel.schema().properties.original then 'original' else '_id'\n    @url = \"#{forModel.urlRoot}/#{forModel.get(identifier)}/patches?status=#{@status}\"\n```\n Nah, http://localhost:3000/db/achievement/signed-up?status=pending is the right format and the right URL; I just asked about /patches to see if there was anything there. If you have patches from the ?status=pending URL, they should show up in the viewer, no?\n There are no patches in the local DB unless you make some. You can submit a PR and I can test with the live DB to see if they are showing up, or you can log into a non-admin account and try to submit some patches to the achievement to test it. (For example, if you go to http://localhost:3000/i18n/achievement/signed-up and submit an en-US change from a non-admin account, it will create a patch.)\n @sderickson we now have the interface in there, but 1) the patches don't update the model, and 2) the patches don't save when accepted:\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-16 17 40 12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/6222087/e8a6fedc-b602-11e4-95f7-ac8e3c98bae3.png)\n\nWhat do we normally do to make patches actually update the models, and what can we do to make them save on these non-versioned Achievements? (Also, the patches don't update the models on Articles, so it's probably the same problem.)\n  Great job, @jimmysvk! Thank you!\n  Hi, @jimmysvk! Thank you for contributing.

Can you tell me:\n1. Which browser accept-languages will browsers send when set to various Norwegian language branches?\n2. Which versions of Norwegian will which people use?\n Okay, I just tested and when I set Chrome to nn, it doesn't even ask for no. So fallback between nb, nn, and no wouldn't work anyway.

Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\nBtw, you missed a \" at the end of line 412, so it is giving you errors.\n ```\n    cla_url: \"CLA\"\n    cla_suffix: \".\"\n    cla_agree: \"JEG AKSEPTERER\"\n  contact:\n```\n\nwith cla_agree: \"...\" being line 566.  Nothing strikes out at me as being wrong.  You're not even using unconventional text.\n I fixed this right after that in the latest master (when merging in the other nb.coffee PR); should be fine now.\n\n@popey456963 I think you must have an old version still.\n  Thanks, great work here\u2013but looks like I was too slow in merging and two Archmages have conributed the same thing, so I merged the other one (#2263). They're both good, but adding the top wood bar to the image works slightly better than putting the close button just on the upper right (which is fine, too).\n  Hi, @tutosfaciles48! Thanks for contributing. Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n Thank you!\n  In first place, when I scroll through the leaderboard, it feels weird, because it hides behind the upper wood instead of the first one.\n\nFROM\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/6093624/c595e99a-aefe-11e4-9b0f-9f21fae38e23.png)\n\nTO\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/6093626/d140ad20-aefe-11e4-9b3b-5d7a90f51343.png)\n\nAlso, in the selection screen, the \"Time\" word could be separated from the word \"Today\".\n![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/6093629/e3691f00-aefe-11e4-8e85-e0786c1ab441.png)\n The first part is a bug; there should be less margin or padding on that child view, and it should be positioned lower, so that it would get cut off right about where the paper ends.\n\nStyles for that are [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/modal/leaderboard-tab-view.sass) and [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/modal/leaderboard-modal.sass).\n\nCould you explain more about what you think would look better for the timespan / score category subtabs? I know the current design isn't very good, so some better design ideas would definitely help, but I'm not sure what you mean.\n Ah, but that wouldn't work well when there are two categories of scores, like when it can be \"Time\" and \"Damage Taken\".\n I mean, the \"Time\" string could be separated from the \"Today\", but I'm am the not the best person to talk about design.\n Ah, looks like @divyanshu013 beat you to it. There are plenty of older good-for-newbies bugs that need help, though!\n  @nwinter, could you propagate i18n? This bug happened because I removed some strings from en.coffee.\n  Thank you, @JulR43!\n  Duplicate of #2044 (point 1).\n  I don't think this is a bug, look at the space for the items, self.shield() is taking up more than half.  It would be cool to maybe lose the images on smaller displays however, so that we could fit multiple on each.  And maybe stretch so that fit nicely?\n There should always be at least two columns, so there's definitely a bug here with the small screen size.\n\nLet's discuss this in #1777.\n  Thanks, @ArthurLu!\n  @Martin005, do you want me to merge as it is, or will you submit more translations?\n  Thanks for fixing that up, @h3yduck! I tested it and made a few more tweaks to get it displaying just right.\n  Thanks @h3yduck! Have you tested to see if this fixes the upload bug? I haven't drilled too deeply, but I didn't see what effect the `changed` class actually has on anything.\n Have you [synced your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) to get the latest master?\n  Thanks, @JulR43!\n  Thank you, @JulR43!\n  Thanks, @Pammer!\n  Thanks, @emmanuel-z!\n  Hi, @emmanuel-z!

Can you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla), so I can merge your pull request?\n Thanks.\n  Thanks, @Coderaulic! Nice job!\n  Hi, @ArthurLu! Thanks for your translations. Will merge PR #2232.\n What do you mean?\n Yeah, it is not working correcly for any commit at the moment.\n  See #399 for a description of where to go to find the `shield` documentation, then add code examples to the `example` field, and submit a patch.\n  See #399 for a description of where to go to find the `shield` documentation, then add code examples to the `example` field, and submit a patch.\n  You can [open it in the level editor](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/sarven-savior) and add a description of how to access array lengths in the guide, in a Specific Article called \"Overview\".\n  I haven't done anything to fix this yet; it's just worse the smaller your screen and the more properties you have access to.\n Let's discuss this in #1777.\n  We probably just have to 1) stop [hiding it in the sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level.sass#L39-L41) and 2) adjust its positioning to make sense in the full-screen layout.\n Actually, we can't easily fix this, because the goals aren't updated in real time, only at the end\u2013they would be misleading if we showed them during the level. And given that it's only hard to remember what to do on a few levels (like Coinucopia), I think we can ignore it.\n  Do you know which ones?\n Added better example docs.\n  Will need to play each level and pick a playback speed that feels right instead of just setting them all to 3.\n  I think he means these tantalizing hero previews:\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-26 08 03 17](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/6395583/fd5ccacc-bd8d-11e4-8256-68fbae74a91d.png)\n\nThose are rendered [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/campaign-view.jade#L16-L16) and [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/campaign-view.jade#L51-L51) in the template.\n\nYeah, will probably need to look at the PlayHeroesModal to figure out how to load the necessary stats and skills to show a tooltip for this.\n  Videos live in the guide: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/menu/GuideView.coffee\n  How about now? I just updated Electrocute to error out earlier when cast on an invalid target.\n Ah, right; not too easily. I think I have fixed it, so I'll close this, but let's keep our eyes out.\n  Migrated to Level Editor task list.\n  I think I fixed this with a8dc353.\n  It happens to me when I try to write a character in the last line. And then, after the editor creates a new line (so that I don't end up writing in the last one, which is intended), the letter I typed gets stored in the suggestions.\n  Migrated to Level Editor task list.\n  Currently just to give a feeling of progression and for us to be able to restrict certain gear to higher level players. Later, it's for more stuff.\n  Got it; the big one is redesigned now and no longer a hover.\n  Fixed Backwoods Ambush and Great Yak Stampede. On Sarven Gaps, Sarven Road, and Thunderhooves, we just need to make the referee smarter about knowing when the goals have been achieved instead of waiting so long to check completion and then assuming that if you're still alive and at the right spot, you've done it.\n I juts need to finish Thunderhooves now. Also just added gold-collected to Mad Maxer Sells Out.\n  Ah, happened when we refactored the castsHeal arguments. Got it now.\n  Thanks, @Coderaulic!\n  Nice catch on the \"help_videos\"! (i've corrected it both in ru and en) As always, thanks for keeping the file up-to-date.\n  Good one!\n  Thanks @JKniager!\n  Hmm; it looks nicer, but many players will not see it. We have made the arrow bigger and bigger many times until in our playtests it was visible enough. What could we do that had around as much visual weight but that wasn't an epilepsy trigger?\n What about making it static, and fade, rather than bounce in?  That way we'd keep most of it's visual weight, but it wouldn't give anyone epilepsy?  \n Both of those changes would reduce its prominence a lot, so you'd need something else to balance it out. At one point we tried having it make a bouncing noise, but that was so annoying we had to get rid of it.\n Yeah. We can't rely too much on the noise, because many players are playing without sound.\n Hmm; maybe also using the new particle effects system can help to reduce the need for the arrow to be so annoying?\n  What operating system are you using, browser, version of browser, rough time until it goes black?  \n Closing until we can reproduce; I'm guessing this might be related to running out of graphics memory or something like this.\n  Hehe, nice names; thanks @JKniager! Can I get you to do two things?\n1. [Sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge these in.\n2. Can you remove `'Steve'` from the list of Ogre Thrower names? The throwers are female, so Steve doesn't make sense.\n  Linked to #2193 \n  Nice, I like these names. Thanks @purenickery!\n  Hi, @Coderaulic! Thanks for your translations.\n It depends on when the changes are sent to production.\n Don\u00b4t really know. Sometimes minutes, other times hours. Just be patient! It will eventually happen.\n Hi, @Coderaulic! I added you in [this](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/3068f18443fd7115259f7d67bc92c7cc8c24cdb8) commit!\n  Thanks, @SuperPranx!\n  Thanks, @jacobakkerboom! You are really taking care of the translations.\n   Wow, nice work, @Imperadeiro98!\n  Thanks @rishiloyola!\n\nThis helped with #1917 for `lang=\"ru\"`, but leaving #1917 open until it works for all languages and we can also fix the sign up button overflow on the same screen.\n  Awesome, thanks @sotonin!\n  I've made it less likely that a user will be able to submit a match with no `submittedCodeLanguage`, and also I've set submittedCodeLanguages for the only 20 sessions of all time that were missing them (which is consistent with the hypothesis that the cause is the race condition that I just fixed). So let's keep our eye out, but hopefully that was it.\n  Hmm, not sure if the fix was uploaded yet. I've just deployed to make sure that the latest server code is in production; still seeing same error now?\n  We probably need to automatically scroll the inventory list to the item being pointed at before showing the arrow.\n  fixupUri broke the help video eventing.  See https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/92f070eccaae62dce2ac597e452933e83dd75247.\n\nWhere else does removeScheme need to be used?\n How does this fix #2159?\n Removing the protocol broke the video player eventing.  It's not necessarily a common problem, or related to caching.\n\nI wouldn't disable ajax caching globally without better understanding the impact.  I also wouldn't disable it globally for non-IE browsers without a clear benefit to other browsers.  Do you know what the global effects would be, and how we'd test this change?\n  Thanks, @negesti!\n  Thanks, @jacobakkerboom!\n  Is it giving you an error code, like \"Forbidden 403\"?  Or are you getting the loading bar that says you don't have permission to access this?\n  @yaur I haven't implemented request retries, but do you still see occasional ThangType load failures causing to \"Setting up simulation\" hangs? Recently it seems that simulations have been much more stable.\n  @sderickson It looked like we were setting up the Campaigns to have i18n properties, so I finished making an [I18NEditCampaignView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/i18n/I18NEditCampaignView.coffee#L18-L18) and using the i18n from the model in 57d12c1, but there are two issues:\n1. Diplomats can't save to the Campaign model. It dies [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/commons/Handler.coffee#L363-L363). Is this something we can easily fix?\n2. After we save it, adjacent campaigns won't update the i18n until they are deleted and re-added. I thought that we could do something simple [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/campaign/CampaignEditorView.coffee#L337-L337) to have it always refresh that data, so at least it'd be updated whenever the campaign was saved, but I'm not clear on how that update should work. Tips?\n  Hi, @JulR43! Thanks for your translations! Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n  And damage, speed, etc.\n  Thanks, @jhoon!\n  Hi, @scenix007! Thanks for your translations! Could you sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n  Awesome, this is super helpful! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n  Always fast!\n  Presumably they get their language tweaked when the change-language event goes out and don't work any more. They should be immune to this sort of change, though, with no readWrite permissions.\n  We need to add a button to the local dev environment, maybe on the account page next to the admin toggle, that will automatically do some of the things mentioned in [this forum post](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/dev-env-localhost-how-to-sandbox-into-god-mode/2299):\n1. Turn the user into a premium user so she can play the premium levels.\n2. Give the user a ton of gems.\n3. Give the user a ton of experience points.\n4. Stop locking levels.\n5. Stop locking items.\n\nIt will probably be a button which makes a request to the server to modify the User object for 1-3, and some client-side logic to respect the `godMode` flag for 1, 4 and 5, plus a bit of server-side logic to respect it for 1, also.\n Yeah, just like that. It will take actions that we don't want to bother reversing (like adding gems), so we can just leave it as a button. But it doesn't matter too much, so if we wanted to make it as a checkbox that didn't fully undo itself, that'd be fine.\n  Duplicate of #1866.\n  I'm not too up on reading this kind of crash log, but it looks like you are running out of memory. Is it only crashing on more intensive maps? Can you look at a system monitoring tool to see how much memory the CodeCombat tab gets up to before it crashes?\n Other players have reported the memory leaks being better lately; are you still seeing these kind of crashes?\n  Fixed it.\n  Hi, @rsiwady29! Thanks for your translations!\n  https://travis-ci.org/codecombat/codecombat\n\nBunch of these:\n`\n2015-01-27T22:58:32.248Z - error: failed to subscribe status=error, code=104, name=Invalid_ApiKey, error=API Key can not be blank\n`\n  Could turn it into a background image with background-size: cover. That would center it along the largest dimension.\n Fixed in #2247.\n I haven't deployed it yet, but it is fixed in development.\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-08 08 18 16](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/6097244/19802e64-af6b-11e4-848a-e1fa5a076e2f.png)\n  Nice\u2013I like the first two, but not the third one (we already got too much Torvalds in there, plus I think one person can do something really well, too). Can you update to just include the first two? Thanks!\n  Thanks @divyanshu013!\n  Ah, the problem isn't that the contact div is taking space, it's just that the interface is at a fixed aspect ratio and can't scale to fill the height (just the width), so there's nothing else going on down there at the bottom. I have some art I want to put in there, but it would be quite a trick to get a fully vertically and horizontally scaling interface.\n Let's discuss this in #1777.\n  We are about to stop sending any data to Mixpanel or Segment, having built our own in-house analytics store, so this will be fixed soon.\n  Thanks @popey456963!\n  I wonder if using `{cache: false}` instead of `null` [here in the LevelSessionsCollection fetch](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/CampaignView.coffee#L54-L54) would also work. If so, then we probably need to make this sort of fix all across the site for IE support. We already noticed one bug with IE not reloading the User when beating the level to get rewards [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/modal/HeroVictoryModal.coffee#L88-L88), and adding `cache: false` saved the day there.\n  Is this still a problem?\n\nThis change forces all videos to load over https: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/92f070eccaae62dce2ac597e452933e83dd75247\n Great, thanks for checking!\n  I like the soldier names, but the obviously superhero names seem out of place. Also, we have Jane already as a soldier and a captain, so we probably shouldn't also have her as a librarian.\n\nWant to update this to just include Arya, Fany, Alzarus, and Potter?\n  It's used [in the next line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/04e06242686a8cafcf6382a5e024aa64c70874a3/app/templates/core/not-found.jade#L9) to pick one of three random not-found images.\n  Kevin's working on the [Sacred Statue level](http://codecombat.com/play/level/sacred-statue), but it is trying to add AoE marks to show the statue's healing circle radius. When trying to add this AoE effect:\n\n`aoe-[\"90.67\",75,\"30.00\",\"rgba(171, 171, 171, 0.1)\"]`\n\nthe LayerAdapter gives this error from the `addCustomGraphic` method:\n\n`Uncaught frame dimensions exceed max spritesheet dimensions`\n\nIt shouldn't be that big, though; we do AoE marks that big in other places, like the CastsWindstorm Component. @sderickson know what's going on with the ground layer spritesheet size there?\n  I'll keep this open until we can figure out what was going on in IE. Thanks for the bug report, @rkt88edmo!\n @differentmatt Seems like this is the same bug as what we originally [fixed](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/e7c626656e360ff3498c987cff17a921b087db7f) with the [cache: false](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/modal/HeroVictoryModal.coffee#L89-L89) line in HeroVictoryModal, but I still see the same behavior in IE: the achievements don't increment gems/exp (and presumably items) on the User object when going into the victory modal.\n\nIt works when the dev tools are open, because they disable caching. So I know it's a caching problem, and I was able to figure out that the rewards aren't being assigned (as opposed to the awards being assigned and then overwritten with a cached `me` object).\n\nBut how could this be? Didn't it start working after you fixed it with `cache: false`? Did something break it again in another way that invalidated the `cache: false` behavior?\n  In the case where the item has \"undefined\" price, we know that either:\n1. There's a bug where the achievement isn't awarding the item properly, like in #2142;\n2. The player has done the level before the achievements were set up properly, and recalculating achievements hasn't worked to award them the item (or hasn't been done yet);\n3. The unlocks aren't configured properly; or\n4. The player has skipped ahead to the level before unlocking it.\n\nWe should be able to detect and fix this client-side so that this kind of problem isn't a blocker for players.\n  Thanks @katemamba!\n  Hi, @Nitamud! Thanks for your translations! Could you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request? Also, could you correct line 502?\n I already told to fix line 502.\n Don't be so mean with you, this kind of things happen.\n We could merge without this fix; the weird comment will get wiped in the next i18n propagation anyway.\n Ok!\n Hi @Nitamud \u2013 can we get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) real quick? Thanks!\n Will reopen if [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) gets signed.\n  Thanks, @jmigual!\n  Hmm; you could check out my beam code and look for bugs. I know that the collision shape it makes isn't the best representation of the beam shape you see. It's possible I still have a mistake in there that makes it hit far outside of its actual region in some cases.\n  I've double-checked the code for any sort of mistakes that could lead to simultaneous-simulation-time mixups like this (we used to have some, so you would have just found the last big simulation inconsistency problem), but I think this kind of error is now pretty unlikely compared to problems with random seeds and flag histories and possibly bad simulator clients, which are the things I'm working on in #1830. Let's keep track of further inconsistencies after my latest round of fixes in that issue.\n  Hi, @nixel2007! Thanks for keeping ru at 100% :+1:\n  Hello, @z3t1! Thank you for your translations!\n  Hi, @probil! Thanks for your translations!\n  Now in #2139!\n  Hi, @chess9876543210! Thanks for your translations! Could you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your pull request?\n Thank you!\n  How about now? Looks like I messed up the geometry on the mid rect when coding my out-of-bounds checker, but someone submitted a patch for me, which I just accepted.\n Should this be closed now?\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/adding-a-tool-to-search-for-specific-tasks-in-level-editor/2367):\n\n> when the profile name is pretty big,the name is being shown over \"profile\".\n\n![aaahhh](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5831547/983f77e0-a0e9-11e4-96a8-d3e6dd4fedb5.png)\n\nProbably just need some CSS to truncate that text to one line.\n Oh yeah, we could just make it taller, duh. That would be good.\n Scrolls on mouseover? Not sure what that would look like; I'd have to see it.\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/adding-a-tool-to-search-for-specific-tasks-in-level-editor/2367):\n\n> I was looking for introductory issues to solve and found one about adding decorations to levels.But to do that one has check every level's setting->tasks to check if decoration is needed or not.It would be saving a lot of time if we had a way to search for the required tasks.\n\nIt would be really great if there was a search for tasks so that one could find all levels which needed decoration, say, or all Thangs which needed animations. Probably if we had a root TasksView that we could have to list all incomplete tasks, which then had filtering/searching, and then a subclasses for LevelTasksView and ThangTaskView, that would do the trick.\n On-page search would be fine if we had a page that listed all the levels' tasks.\n  Ah, didn't see this until just now. Looks like some intervening changes fixed this a different way. Thanks for the fix, though!\n  Hi, @MarielleB! Thanks for your translations! Next time, could you uncomment (remove the # symbol) from your translations?\n  Thanks @AdnanZahid, good tips!\n  I don't think so; the default clone links you get from copy/pasting from GitHub include .git, so it's more work to remove them.\n  Hello, @McGiogen! Thanks for your help! Could you please sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your pull request?\n  Hmm, I don't think these ones are adding too much; I like the other ones that are there (programming quotes, eccentric stuff, etc.) better.\n  Nice job, @nixel2007! Always at 100% :)\n  Tried @nemoyatpeace 's solution in the editor, it worked, so I'll assume this issue is fixed.  If it not, please reopen @delve\n Although the workaround with `is` works, it does seem like a bug that the `==` doesn't, probably in Filbert. That said, I was trying to reproduce this with `type` and `value` and couldn't, so perhaps the latest Aether fixes got it, since these all work:\n\n``` python\ncoins = [c for c in coins if c.type == \"coin\"]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if c.type is \"coin\"]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if c.type != \"bitcoin\"]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if not c.type is \"bitcoin\"]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if c.value == 3]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if c.value != 3]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if c.value is 3]\ncoins = [c for c in coins if not c.value is 3]\n```\n  Thanks, @noiseorigin!\n  Hi, @ssfinney! Thank you for your contribution!\n  Hi, @noiseorigin! Thank you for your translations! Could you please sign the [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your PR?\n  Is there a way to get this to work retroactively?\n  More bug reports of this [on the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/backwoods-brawl-locked-up-after-level-completion/2359/6).\n I'm having a really hard time reproducing this bug.\n If the achievement showed up gray instead of counting up when you see the victory screen, it probably didn't fire. It will correctly give you all the gems if you beat it on the next difficulty and it works, though. But if it never fires for you on a particular level, you haven't gotten your gems yet.\n Right. The achievements are set up to say, oh look, you beat it on difficulty 4, and last time we gave you gems for this achievement, it was for difficulty 2, so now you need additional gems for 3 and 4. Or if you beat it on difficulty 3 and it had never been awarded, it'll give you 1, 2, and 3.\n Has anyone been seeing this bug lately on any of the replayabls, like Sarven Treasure, Sarven Siege, Kithgard Brawl, etc.?\n  Oh right, I totally built this, just like you said, a few days ago.\n Would you expect to keep the gems from your highest-achieved difficulty or to earn gems again for the lower ones?\n  Moving from #1241. This might be easier than some of the stuff we're doing with devSetup.py and the separate Windows installer.\n I think so, but I haven't tested. It would be good if we test and then move that project into the main CodeCombat repository (at least, from my scanty knowledge of how Vagrant works). Right?\n  This is 6:\n1. `loop`\n2. `self.moveRight()`\n3. `self.findNearestEnemy()`\n4. `self.attack(...)`\n5. `self.findNearestEnemy()`\n6. `self.attack(...)`\n That's 'cause the `enemy.health`, `0`, and `>` are all statements, too. I know, I know, statement counter is bad; we will work on it with the next version of our transpiler, which should make things much easier to count intuitively.\n  Thank you, @enricpc, for your work towards the translation into Catalan.\n  It definitely works better to have the scrolling in the first configuration I tried, but the second one used up too much space for the spell palette and not enough for the code editor:\n\nBefore:\n\n![screenshot 2015-01-15 11 08 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5764456/faf327d4-9ca6-11e4-8a17-1c92fccc3d5f.png)\n\nAfter:\n\n![screenshot 2015-01-15 11 09 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5764463/037952a2-9ca7-11e4-98af-32686dd51082.png)\n\nI think the `flex-direction: row` style is messing it up. I guess that's in there so we don't have to do the extra column assignment logic, but it's making it significantly less space-efficient for variable-height \"rows\" of items with different amounts of properties. Thoughts?\n Sorry, this is some hairy CSS indeed! The thing to test would be to have a ton of items which have different numbers of properties per item. Later glasses and spellbooks often have a bunch, so are good to test with.\n This is related to #1777.\n  And if we moved Cavern Survival until after the real-time playback submit button is introduced, that would help out here. I'll just make some tasks in Cavern Survival level itself to do this and #2098.\n  We should probably just move the Cavern Survival unlock until after the if-statements are introduced.\n  Thank you for your contribution, @enricpc :D\n  Thanks, @RubenDjOn!\n  Nice, that's a good improvement for #1974.\n  Hi, @vuthaihoc! Thanks for your contribution! Could you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your PR?\n Will reopen if the CLA is signed.\n  Good call!\n  600-700MB \u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5b58\u90fd\u662f\u9700\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u56fd\u5185\u7f51\u7ad9\u6162\u6027\u6765\u8bf4\uff1a\u7531\u4e8eGFW\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u628a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u653e\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u624d\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u73b0\u5728\u6ca1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n  It might help, as long as people don't get confused from our instructions and then think they need to run coco-mongodb but see it die from EADDRINUSE and not know it's already running. So we would just want to update the instructions for using it, I guess.\n Nice work, @emhs!\n  Can you check the JS console to see if it's spitting out any error messages about not being able to spawn the wave, maybe due to a misconfigured wave or not matching the Builds/Spawns dependent ThangTypes?\n  As in #2084: we need to be able to make it work with the flexible size, which depends on your screen size and how tall the code editor has gotten, so can't hard-code the width and height here.\n That's the right file. You might also need to do something in its parent, tome.sass.\n The height isn't fixed because it varies based on how tall the editor gets, which is a function of your code. See the logic [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L538-L550) and [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellPaletteView.coffee#L84-L97). It also changes how many columns it has based on your screen width, and of course the number of elements in each column are dependent on what gear you have equipped...\n\nCan we do the scrolling without fixing the height of the spell palette?\n  But the spell palette area is a flexible size, so hard-coding the dimensions here would only work for one particular screen layout...\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/desert-is-too-difficult-and-world-map/2297/6?u=nick). This would be really handy on the randomized challenge levels with scalable difficulty.\n  From [this comment](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/2066#issuecomment-69360578). If you log in from the campaign editor, the [JS that handles the login form submit](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/core/AuthModal.coffee#L18-L18) doesn't fire for some reason, so it actually submits the form (which doesn't do anything except reload the page and happily put your credentials in the URL).\n It's a new editor that only admins really use right now, so we haven't documented it anywhere. It's how we lay the levels out in order and adjust the pacing and stuff like that.\n I think @divyanshu013 was working on it, although I might be misremembering. He had gotten pretty close, possibly something with two AuthModals being opened because the parent CampaignEditorView and the child CampaignView, both being RootViews, were both listening to the login button click event.\n  Perfect job, as always, @RubenDjOn!\n  Try using `loop` instead of `loop:`, since you're in CoffeeScript.\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/possible-bug-on-sarven-brawl/2239). For code like this on Sarven Brawl:\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    drop = self.findNearest(self.findItems())\n    enemy = self.findNearest(self.findEnemies())\n\n    if enemy:\n        while enemy.health > 0:        \n            self.say(enemy.health)        \n            self.say(enemy.type)\n            self.attack(enemy)\n    else:\n        self.moveXY(drop.pos.x, drop.pos.y)\n```\n\nOr code like this on Backwoods Brawl:\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    enemies = self.findEnemies()\n    numEnemies = len(enemies)\n    if numEnemies != 0:\n        enemy = self.findNearest(enemies)\n        while enemy.health > 0:\n            if self.isReady(\"cleave\"):\n                self.cleave(enemy)\n            elif self.isReady(\"bash\"):\n                self.bash(enemy)\n            else:\n                self.attack(enemy)\n```\n\nWe get infinite loops on the `while enemy.health > 0` part. Weird, because this pattern appears to work in Sarven Shepherd, where we introduce it. My first guess is that the `enemy` variable is not being updated from its API clone.\n\nWorking code pattern in Sarven Shepherd:\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    enemies = self.findEnemies()\n    enemyIndex = 0\n    while enemyIndex < len(enemies):\n        enemy = enemies[enemyIndex]\n        if enemy.type != 'sand-yak':\n            while enemy.health > 0:\n                self.attack(enemy)\n        enemyIndex += 1\n```\n Fixed by https://github.com/codecombat/aether/commit/687abedc45697a8354614b4f1a1db3dd6657aaf0\n\nWasn't an API protection issue after all.  We were corrupting Python objects returned from API calls, which is why `enemy = enemies[enemyIndex]` worked but `enemy = self.findNearest(enemies)` didn't.\n  Yes: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/headless_client.coffee\n\nBut last I remember, it was giving a small number of worrisome ties that disagreed with the browser simulator, so we need to sit down and debug it very carefully to make sure it's giving the same results as the browser simulator before we start firing it up. (Higher priority is to figure out the other simulation bugs like #1830 and #1892.)\n The headless client should be working again now.\n  Wow, so many translations! Thank you, @SuperPranx!\n  Hi, @182mick44! Thank you for contributing to the project! Could you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your pull request?\n  Thank you for keeping ru up-to-date :) @nixel2007\n  From [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/cannot-read-property-formals-of-null/2243):\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    enemies = self.findEnemies()\n    enemy = self.findNearest(enemies)\n    if is_soldier(enemy):\n        # Assess the threat and take appropriate action\n```\n\n> The if line is giving the error Cannot read property 'formals' of null when is_soldier(enemy) is evaluated and enemy is None (or null to be precise).\n> \n> I'm performing the null check inside is_soldier() but it's never reached because the program crashes before reaching the check.\n> \n> FWIW, here is my definition of is_soldier(). It shouldn't matter how it's defined since I believe passing null as an argument is causing the error.\n\n``` python\ndef is_soldier(enemy):\n    if enemy and not is_sandyak(enemy):\n        return True\n    return False\n```\n\n@differentmatt I'm sure we have some issues for Python function definitions somewhere, but I don't think I'd seen this one before. Know what's up?\n This looks like a bug in the function parameter processing code.  I fixed a different error I got with this sample code, but was unable to get the same null formals error.\nhttps://github.com/differentmatt/filbert/commit/e1d22465c6bbaf2273e397d9c7138560c129dc94\n\n@dideler Can you past your full code example here?\n Invalid Python.  You need to define your functions before using them.\n\nI've opened a separate Python parser issue to throw a more reasonable error.\n You can do it in most cases because we're running JavaScript under the hood.  But, the correct solution is not to make this invalid Python work in all cases.\n\nSee https://github.com/differentmatt/filbert/issues/55 for more details.\n  Hi, @RubenDjOn! Thanks a lot for your translations!\n  Isn't this not going to scale to the size of the player's browser very well? What about doing something with percentage-based units instead of px?\n Closing for now; feel free to update with something more flexible.\n  Hi, @steveshining! Thanks for your commit. Could you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in?\n Thanks!\n  I think that the \"Not Found\" page is bad formated.\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/5653645/096ae5ca-96b4-11e4-9284-d6c3c0b57b0e.png)\nIn the first place it is not translated.\nSecond, the upper menu looks weird.\n Now it is kind of fixed, but doesn't look good. It opens up the page described above, and then updates it with i18n and, sometimes, switches the image.\n  @sderickson can you take a look at this one?\n Also need this for Discourse: https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-google-oauth2-login-for-discourse/15858\n  Cool, thanks @GeetikaBatra\u2013can you sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in?\n What page did you log in from where that happened? I saw this once but couldn't find out why it was happening.\n  **goldstorm**: I was thinking the coins would be flung from the sky over a short period of time, maybe bouncing a bit. Coins don't currently have `Moves`, and I wouldn't want to add it for performance reasons, but we could manually update their trajectories. Or we could do something easier.\n\n**invisibility**: Does it cancel current targeting like `targeting.Hides` does? (I haven't checked, maybe this already works.) The new WebGL graphics can't really do alpha transparency like before, but if we set an effect to make alpha 0.25 or 0.5 or something, then if we fix it, it'll start working, sort of.\n\n**lightning-bolt**: I was actually thinking that this would be an infinite range, single-target lightning attack where you could call a bolt of lightning from the sky. It would be easier to get the graphics and coding working this way, anyway. We could do it the bouncing way, which would be cool, just not sure that we'll be able to easily visualize that.\n\n**summon-burl**: It may be easier for me to do this one, since the logic for getting ThangTypes to spawn right is particularly tricky.\n\n**summon-undead**: Currently there's only one level of this spell (Unholy Tome V), so I don't know if it needs to be configurable. We do have skeleton art now.\n\n**teleport**: It would be too OP if you could teleport enemy units, but maybe you can teleport yourself or friendly units. It should fail to work if you teleport into a Thang with `collisionCategory` `\"obstacle\"`.\n\n**antigravity**: This would presumably just toggle the Movement System gravity to go the other way for a little while, and we'd see what happened then. (Maybe it only does it for Thangs in a certain radius). Really not sure how this one is going to play, but should be hilarious if nothing else!\n We don't want to have any unit-specific art for the spells, since that's a ton of work, so currently it has to either be 1) Marks above their heads, 2) Marks on the ground around them, 3) projectiles, 4) simple AoE effects like the animated circles we have, 5) particle effects (but only if someone wants to build a particle effect system).\n\nSo far we haven't assigned teleport to anything, so it could either be an ultra-power skill on a high-end special-purpose item, or it could have some negative downside (long casting time, random direction, and/or short range). Swap could be used as a more interesting form for escaping, perhaps, since you have to have another unit at that position. (A minion or pet?) It should have a range limitation, for sure.\n Typically the wand / staff has the strong attack spell, with the spellbooks having some attack but more support / survival / fun stuff. Don't want too many attack spells to be able to stack, because the DPS would be hard to manage if you could swap between four different attack spells, since their main drawback is cooldown.\n Doesn't sound like that added complexity buys us too much, especially before we have the ability to visualize cooldowns (which we really need).\n  Thank you, @Kindleme!\n  Thanks, @RubenDjOn!\n  This is intended, although maybe it's a little worse than it should be (could increase magic projectile speed). The ball is following an arc, like an arrow would. I hesitate to make it much more reliably accurate, since the AOE damage on the magic attacks can be so powerful...\n Currently the magic projectiles are using combat.Shell. We could make a new Component that flies in a different manner and use that instead. I don't really like hitting the intermediate targets like arrows do, since then you have less strategic options for targeting guys behind the lines. What if the magic projectiles had some limiting ability to home in on their target\u2013not by changing x and y velocity, but by changing z velocity to land at the right time (i.e., not too early in this case)? You could then also dramatically emphasize the arc that the magic projectile follows instead of being limited to weak gravity.\n  Thank you for keeping ru up-to-date, @nixel2007!\n  Need to take this:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/ThangType.coffee#L12-L25\n\nand this:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L637-L639\n\nand put it into the ThangType model:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/schemas/models/thang_type.coffee\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/levels/thangs/thang_type_handler.coffee#L37-L37\n\nClass and gender should be easy; need to figure out how to dynamically load the list of Hero ThangTypes wherever that is being used in the codebase.\n  Thanks, @RubenDjOn!\n  @nwinter, is everything fine like this?\n Yeah, I've talked to @nwinter and it is.\n Nice work, @Imperadeiro98.\n  Thanks, @StijnBerendse!\n  Hi, @Apoc-! Thanks for your translations. Could you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your PR?\n Thanks, @Apoc-! If you really want to help, you can visit http://codecombat.com/i18n, choose your language and start translating the database content.\n  Thanks, @divaDseidnA!\n  Ah yeah, those wands/staffs don't exist yet. Now that the Thangs are done, the next step is to go back to all the Components:\n1. Add the new names to the top-level `default` object with the default values.\n2. Delete the old names from the config schema `default` and `properties`.\n3. Delete the old name handling from the spell initialization in the code.\n4. Submit a patch.\n\nThen when all those are ready, I'll merge them all and I'll do the last step, which is to delete the now-unrecognized properties from all the item Thangs.\n Phew, done! (Time will tell if we missed any.) Nice work as always, @nemoyatpeace!\n  Thanks for your translations, @SuperPranx! Your pull request doesn't have any error. The build sometimes fails (and I don't understand why).\n  Hi, @RubenDjOn! Your pull request is totally fine!\n  Nice job!\n  @StijnBerendse, I already removed the # before all your previous translations. Could you update your branch and reopen the PR?\n  Thank you, @Kindleme, for your contribution! Could you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge your pull request?\n  Hello, @StijnBerendse! Thanks for your contribution!

The logo could be put in one corner and serve as link.\n- [ ] Link from discourse.codecombat.com to codecombat.com is missing. Also the link behind the logo seems misleading as it does not direct to the main page codecombat.com, but discourse.codecombat.com/top.\n- [ ] Link and logo from blog.codecombat.com/ back to codecombat.com is missing.\n- [x] Going from codecombat.com to codecombat.com/play always leads to the Dungeon and not the last region, where you were playing.\n- [ ] Account is not accessible from codecombat.com/play.

I'll look into it.\n Caused by an autocomplete insertion bug: https://github.com/differentmatt/zatanna/commit/7d659853bfdf653cad0f45f2ea1ecdec99e6eea6\n\nShould be fixed after next production deploy.\n  Wow! So many translations! You took care of all the contribute stuff! Thanks, @osanseviero. \n  Thanks, @SuperPranx!\n  Hey ho Artisans, let's band together and make all our levels pretty!\n\nWe now have a lot of doodads (miscellaneous art pieces, like trees and rocks and scorpions and houses and whatever) that can really add a lot of ambience to our levels, but often when we go through and work on a level, we don't spend a ton of time on the artistic flourishes. That's where you can help.\n### 1. Find a level from the level editor that needs decorating.\n\nYou can search for a level by name from http://codecombat.com/editor/level or you can go to the campaign editor ([dungeon](http://codecombat.com/editor/campaign/dungeon), [forest](http://codecombat.com/editor/campaign/forest), [desert](http://codecombat.com/editor/campaign/desert)) and double-click a level, then click the editor link. Go to the Settings tab, open up the Tasks, and [see if it needs decorating](https://www.dropbox.com/s/an6bbz5cuy9hhl6/Screenshot%202015-01-01%2016.42.55.png?dl=0).\n### 2. Start bringing doodads in from the right-hand menu.\n\n![screenshot 2015-01-01 16 45 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5593677/9bfd2314-91d5-11e4-9b51-3d020ec0e5a0.png)\n\n![screenshot 2015-01-01 16 46 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5593680/cfea13ee-91d5-11e4-92a9-71b010873eb8.png)\n\n_Just an example; I know you can do it prettier than this!_\n### 3. Use alt-left to rotate some doodads to face the other way.\n\nAlt+left rotates the selected Thang horizontally, so you don't get a bunch of the same doodad facing the same direction\u2013a little variety always helps.\n### 4. Use alt-c to toggle off collision on anything that might get in the way.\n\nIf I put a decorative tree into the level, to make sure I don't mess up existing game balance, I might turn off collision for that tree with the alt+c shortcut. There are (a bunch of level editor shortcuts here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs/ThangsTabView.coffee#L57-L76).\n### 5. Hit save in the upper right to submit a patch.\n\n![screenshot 2015-01-01 16 50 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5593683/5d8d4b6c-91d6-11e4-9e0e-d1393480baeb.png)\n\n_The floppy disk icon up in the upper right._\n### Thanks!\n  Just trying a little fix here, although I don't have a ton of time to test right now (maybe more later); can you clear your browser cache and let me know what behavior you see when not using an argument now?\n @nemoyatpeace heads up\u2013not that I expect you to fix it, but just to let you know that this is also something that needs help to make Raise Dead work right. (How were you testing it the other day?)\n Let's test it in a few more levels before removing the duration; I don't want to accidentally make something that's too overpowered and scales up with the difficulty of the enemies, then have to nerf it.\n Could we try reverting their team/superteam one frame (`@world.dt` seconds) _before_ they die again, and maybe replace their die method with one that switches the team back before calling the original die method?\n `confuse` here does two things:\n1. It makes [the `confuse` Mark](http://codecombat.com/editor/thang/confuse) appear above the Thang's head, and so must be `confuse`.\n2. It sort of identifies the `\"raise-dead\"` effect (except because we want to use the `confuse` Mark, we change the unique string. (We don't have a `raised` Mark.)\n\nIf we want to remove effects, we can do it like this:\n\n``` coffeescript\ncorpse.effects = (e for e in corpse.effects when e.name isnt 'confuse')\n```\n\nDownside: if the corpse was confused from another effect that causes confusion, it'll lose that effect, too. I don't think that's something to be concerned about here, though.\n\nAlso, `@.die()` is better written as `@die()`\u2013CoffeeScript `@` can mean either `this` or `this.`.\n The infinite recursion would be because `die` is now `raisedDie`. You want to have a reference to `originalDie` and then call that within `raisedDie`.\n\nProbably try against something that's not a hero; the heroes are much more complicated in how they chooseAction.\n Just to catch me up: what currently is still not working about it?\n Think I got it all fixed up.\n Is this when the corpse dies again because it is killed, or because it times out?\n Oh yeah, raising a certain power of corpses instead of a certain number would make so much more sense! We should change it to do that instead. It could raise until it had exceeded the power, since if we let it go over, we won't have disappointing raises where it, say, gets one thrower and then can't get the brawler and doesn't do anything afterwards.\n\nProblem: power table is in the Referee Component. I guess we should move it somewhere else so that CastsRaiseDead can access it. But where?\n Ah, I just realized that the power table should go into the Existence or Combat Systems, since you can always access properties of Systems from Components.\n I did see the bug with enemies failing to keep fighting after targeting a corpse, so that's still happening.\n I've fixed the bugs with dead units not returning to death properly if they time out instead of being killed again, and with living units continuing to target them. I've also moved the buildTypePowers to the Existence System. Want to take over and change it to raise a certain power of dead units?\n  Thanks, @flauta! Good job, as always.\n  Good catch; I've zoomed out on those two levels and changed the defaults to make it less likely to happen again.\n  Actually, \"ire\" is correct here. But I'll change it to \"to provoke them\" to prevent confusion. Thanks!\n  I've changed it so that any sort of haste/slow doesn't affect specificCooldowns, just general cooldowns. So you'll still attack and move faster or slower, but your spells and bashes and things will follow the regular intervals.\n  Good job :)\n  Thank you for keeping cs up-to-date.\n  Right; I hid it. We can put it back when we fix #1769.\n  There is no problem at all.\n  No problem.\n  Thank you, @SuperPranx! Keep up the good work :)\n  I will merge the other PR.\n  Hasn't occurred since 12/28.\n  I fixed it by making it wait longer until reloading the level.\n  @nwinter, could you remove the autorun related code as it is no longer used?\n  Ok, everything is fine. Thank you!\n  Good job with the Macedonian language, @SuperPranx! I hope it helps many players!\n I totally agree with you.\n  Actually, I think another player has almost finished implementing this and just needs to send me a pull request. Will need to do this again soon for the new mountain map stuff.\n\nThe idea isn't to totally fill the space with doodads, just to fill it with floors and then arrange some doodads artfully on top of it for those levels where the player doesn't want to spend any time configuring the initial layout, so at least we don't get a whole bunch of levels which are just empty floors.\n\nThere are certainly other improvements to be made, like configurable level sizing instead of just small & large, and maybe specifying whether you want an enclosed level, what doodad density, etc., but we can open another issue to talk about any improvements like that.\n @Lynxbob Could you submit a pull request with what you have so far?\n We also need the new Mountain doodads in there.\n  @nwinter, could you check if this doesn't mess up with other things?\n  Thank you for this fixes, @osanseviero.\n  Thank you for keeping ru up-to-date.\n  Several players have been reporting similar problems once they get to the real-time submission levels in IE11; didn't get their system specs to see whether it was because of slowness.\n  Thank you for your work, @osanseviero.\n  It is not necessary to add new stuff to the other locale files, because it can be propagated. @nwinter, could you take care of this?\n No problem.\n  Hi, @MinecraftWidget! Thank you for your translations. Could you sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) and remove the # simbol from lines 157 and 196?\n Thank you for fixing the issues.\n  Hi, @mileshayter! Thank you for your translations. Could you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge?\n Thank you.\n  We need to fix #1570, and then this will start working. Closing in favor of that issue.\n  Hi, @flauta! Everything looks fine, except that you should ensure that you uncomment your translations (remove the # simbol). Could you do that?\n  Hello, @nixel2007! Thanks for your translations!\n  Migrated to Level Editor task list for this level.\n  Migrated to Level Editor task list.\n  Hello, @tpai! Awesome work, as always :)\n  Possibly related: http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/item-icons-not-loading/2222\n  This is looking better! Can you submit a pull request so I can try it on some different screen sizes?\n This is much better now with #2094. Some day we might be able to do even better, since the positioning is still a little weird due to the way Bootstrap does it.\n  Thanks for your translations, @uaMithril!\n  Thank you, @uaMithril!\n  Thank you for your help, @tpai!\n  Wow! So many translations! Thank you, @Martin005, for your huge help! :)\n It would be awesome\n Done! (5d9e303)\n  Proposed API:\n\n`isPathClear(pos1, pos2)`: returns whether there are any obstacles (including walls, cliffs, houses, boulders, doors, etc.) or hazards (fire-trap, bear-traps, spike walls, pits, lava flows, etc.) between pos1 and pos2, inclusive.\n\n`findHazards`: returns a list of hazards, visible or not.\n\nThis wouldn't let you query for all obstacles, since there are a lot of them, it'd be slow, and the obstacles are often not what you'd expect (like when we use Invisible Obstacle 3 instead of 6 cliffs). But it would let you do your own bits of pathfnding, and it would let you check for traps.\n\nComments?\n I want to make it return all hazards instead of just visible ones for performance, because then we don't have to check line of sight (which is slow).\n  Hi, @divaDseidnA! Thank you for your translations.\n  Hello @gratzley! I love your enthusiasm. For me to merge this I only need a couple things:\n\n1- First, you need to sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla), so that I can merge your pull request.\n2- Second, you need to uncomment your translations (remove the # symbol).\n @gratzley, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n Closing for now; could merge if we could get the CLA signed. @gratzley please let us know if you can sign it\u2013thanks!\n  @tjchan001 Although, I believe you have accessed the console.  For reference to readers of this issue, read [this](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers).  Also, what you printed appear to be an error, which means that this function does not work.\n  This is possibly happening because the multiplayer levels don't have any achievements. After we do that, we'll check whether this is still showing as \"started\" instead of \"complete\".\n We now have a mechanism for adding achievements for these\u2013you will get more gems/exp for a solution which defeats progressively harder levels of prepopulated AI strategies, which sidesteps a lot of the multiplayer ladder-based balancing issues. We're tracking retrofitting existing levels with achievements in another place, so will close this one.\n  This was implemented [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L217-L223) but may still be buggy based on feedback from [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/kounter-kithwise-space-bar-randomly-stops-working-in-code-editor/2293). More testing / steps to repro are needed.\n Ah, right; we recently migrated the hard-coded level options to database properties editable from the campaign editor. But mainly we need to go into levels like Dungeons of Kithgard and make sure that spaces work in single-line comments but don't work in normal code, in all programming languages.\n That's the first level.\n Okay; will close unless someone else sees an issue.\n  That's pretty good; if you have it hooked up to show when there is an error, please submit a pull request.\n  Closing until I can get a copy of the picture that doesn't work.\n  Nice job, @Martin005!\n  Thank you for your contribution, @fcrozetta.\n  I've fixed a bunch of perceived runtime lag with the plan() yielding dropped frame fix. I'm not sure this is what was causing your problem\u2013the code is a bit strange\u2013but I can't reproduce it now, so I assume it is fixed.\n  Thank you for your contributions, @Martin005!\n  Thanks, @nixel2007.\n  Hi, @uaMithril. Thank you for your translations. Could please sign our [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in?\n  Dueling Grounds no longer has any obstacles in the main spawn area (and is convex in general).\n  Thank you for your contributions, @Rubiconline.\n  Thank you, @Igzok!\n  Thanks, @Rubiconline.\n  Just tested this and it appears to be working now; nearest friend is one of the archers at first.\n  It now has a weak stun effect with it, so that may scale up and be worth using even as the damage falls off against stronger foes. And it looks like a potion.\n  So it sounds like both problems on Mac have been on 10.6.8 so far. Is it possible to try updating to a more recent OS X version that might have better graphics drivers?\n  Closing unless someone else can reproduce. Could have possibly been an issue with user's system clock time being three years in the past.\n    Couldn't figure out how to handle \"Pending\", \"Accepted\", etc. (in patches.jade)\n\nTell me if there are any errors.\n I would love to! Thank you! It has been an honor to help your project and see it growing everyday! :D\n Ok!\n It sounds cool. If it is not a problem to you, I accept it.\n Done!\n  Just trying to see if it is done this way.\n  Had a player report this very recently:\n\n> The \"Edited a Level\" achievement notification kept popping up continuously once I triggered it, filling the screen with notifications until I reloaded\n\nThis was an experienced dev, so I don't think they were in IE, but not sure which browser.\n I think this should be fixed with [this change](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/d09636306c96d79a3ff0b832c28097e651fb0c21#diff-c07840c392d97d7d0964a2a2e2943be4R370).\n  I think I've found the bug with Hushbaum not showing up right away; the achievement unlocking her was ill-configured.\n Here's an example of how to reduce per-language font sizes when text doesn't fit:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/home.sass#L86-L89\n\nWe could do this here for Russian, or for all non-English languages to be safer, or we could come up with a better way of finding the right font size for a given button and text string.\n  The code that I linked only shows how to reduce the font size per-language for the home page slogan text; a similar approach still needs to be taken here.\n If we can figure out how to get those buttons to wrap onto two lines, that'll be cool; it might be a bit tricky with the CSS, though. One solution would be to 1) reduce the font size a bit for \"ru\" and 2) make an alternate translations that wasn't so long.\n  This is a very difficult issue to solve, counting statements is hard for the user, and counting lines can be easily gamed in some languages (JavaScript you can use a minimiser to get a single line for every challenge).  \n\nIf anyone has a suggestion on how to do it, please do say.\n Let's just discuss in 1808.\n  @meritrapa, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n Closing for now; could merge if we could get the CLA signed.\n    @jmigual, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n Closing for now; could merge if we could get the CLA signed.\n  Just added some more scripts, and had added more comments and docs. Have done several things now to guide the player towards pressing submit in Coinucopia, even a second time, to get to the flags.\n  @chiviro, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n Closing for now; could merge if we could get the CLA signed.\n  There's also this bug report a user emailed to us, talking about the ladder update match results emails:\n\n> Clicking on the \"See Match\" buttons takes me to that level but doesn't load my code -- it looks like the code has been reset to default, even when I go back \"home\" and look at \"My Matches\".\n    Should be fixed with my fixes to #2293, if not before.\n  Is it possible to translate the two strings at the end of this file https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/ladder_home.sass?\n Ok. When I saw they were in the .sass file I thought it was strange, but now I realized it is possible.\n    @Stan05, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n Closing for now; could merge if we could get the CLA signed.\n  Others have been reporting 403 Forbidden instead of 401 Unauthorized.\n This error appeared while trying to modify an existing achievement translation:\n\nValidation failed for Patch: '[object Object]'.

It solved it.\n  I will close this, because the issue has been fixed - @chess9876543210 , you should still be able to reply to @nwinter 's question.\n   I made the change because it was not working for me:\n\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/5307142/7f089c72-7c02-11e4-834f-b1944be11972.png)\n  I don't think we are getting malformed double-team errors any more, but if anyone sees one, let me know.\n\nI've added some logic to abort the simulation if we see those NaN velocities, so at least it should finish pretty quickly, although it'd be better if we could recover, or at least figure out what piece of game engine code got the NaNs into the velocities in the fires place.\n  So it's possible that the bad matchups are being caused by a bad simulation client being unable to load certain code properly and incorrectly erroring out those players, and we only see intermittent bad matches due to this because many correct simulation clients are also simulating?\n I've hooked it up so that we are tracking who simulates which matches, so if you see a bad match, hover over it and look for patterns in who is simulating it using which browser, etc.\n\n![screenshot 2015-02-11 21 04 28](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/6162094/b9b748e0-b231-11e4-8830-333a9435add7.png)\n I found and fixed two sources of possible error so far:\n1. The random seeds were not taking into account the number of times each session had been submitted for real-time playback in the Simulator, whereas when playing, the random seeds would take that into account\u2013but differently depending on which side you were playing, so even two players watching the same match between themselves would see a different random seed. I have taken the submission count out of the random seeds for now; it was only really interesting for sync PVP, anyway, so I'll fix it when we get that going again.\n2. chess was right\u2013the match playbacks were remembering each players' flag history, but the Simulator wasn't taking those into account. Most players didn't use flags, but some of them did, and this would cause discrepancies. Now the Simulator also remembers the last flags placed by each player. This isn't perfect, because the flags can be updated independently of a code resubmission, but that should be an even smaller problem similar to when players submit again and you can't see the code they had at the time your match was played with them, which we can fix by a better architecture (like in #651).\n\nLet's keep our eyes out for more sources of discrepancy, but I'm guessing things will be a lot more accurate now.\n Seen a couple more, so I guess something is still up. I'll add more analytics.\n We now show the random seed that was used to simulate the match when you hover over the row, so let's see whether the random seed is the same if you ever see two matches against the same player in quick succession and they disagree. Or, if the match disagrees, see if the random seed it spits out in the JS console when replaying the match is the same as the one in the tooltip on the match result row.\n  When playing a Dueling Grounds match, neither player saw the other's code execute correctly.  This problem does not always reproduce.\n\nPlayer 1 had similar output as below.  Looking at the level sessions in the db, it seems like the team swapping didn't work correctly.  Both players are human, and therefore only have human transpiledCode in their level session.\n\nPlayer 2 JS console output:\n\n``` sh\nOther player is coding codecombat.com/javascripts/app.js:4796\nWebSocket connection to 'ws://codecombat.com:9485/' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_TIMED_OUTcodecombat.com/javascripts/vendor.js:6834\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://codecombat.com/file/interface/spell-palette-entry-open-1.mp3\nFailed to load resource: net::ERR_CACHE_MISS http://codecombat.com/play/level/dueling-grounds\nEos: Let there be light upon Dueling Grounds!

I think the real fix will be switching Aether to rely on each parser to count unique statements before any transpilation, normalization, or instrumentation.\n  Instead of the world.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/PlayLevelView.coffee#L854\n  Need to figure out what the permissions story is for sync pvp.  In the short term, we should probably make these level sessions read only and worry about over-sharing later.\n\nExample 403: \n![opplvl403](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/5161622/d0df8126-7362-11e4-8486-8ac9149dd522.png)\n Fixed by 48d5dd9dc6ad6dcf0960ba9b458a30545810178d\n I thought it was because I wasn't using the 'multiplayer' field:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/8c45e22741b197c732ef237580fced30fb76f84d/app/models/LevelSession.coffee#L15\n\nAre level session permissions all or nothing?  It seems like we'd want exchange the minimal set of data in the future, instead of exposing the whole opponent's level session.  We could also store the necessary info (transpiledCode, etc.) elsewhere and keep the level session private.\n  I'm looking into this.  It didn't repro in Python.\n Fixed by https://github.com/differentmatt/zatanna/commit/50d8610e2677e972a54ac1e8ed4ba63ecd956b67\n\nShould be available in the next production deploy, which usually happens daily.\n  Need to update [this code](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/TomeView.coffee#L80-L86) to use the right return syntax per language. Probably want to move the comment logic into SpellView, where we know which language the spell is in and have the [comment regex](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L782-L782) ready and all that.\n There's no return, but you could add some one-line Clojure at the beginning that would cause it to error out, which would stop the infinite loop, like `(.dieEarly this \"now\")` (or something less dumb).\n  Finally got this one!\n  I think this will be fixed by fixing #1830, so I'll close in favor of that one. I don't want to make the emails hide the problem.\n  I think that if we set the root data, Treema will have no choice but to rebuild all the nodes. Instead we need to somehow get Treema to delete just its empty folder nodes.\n  I thought so too.  I think this is the problematic line, since it's happening during level load:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/PlayLevelView.coffee#L624\n\nThis fires after the session is loaded.  Do you know if `me.get('name')` could return null here?\n\nIf it is possible, I can update this code to account for it.  If we don't think it's possible, I'll have to investigate some more.\n Fixed by c203ff15a2257168e32ec964453246ca90d8dfb6\n  At the moment of speaking, the move command will cancel after a certain amount of time if said location is unreachable.  The hero will say that he cannot reach the location.\n  - [x] Finish debugging the memory leak fix reenablement of doc init tracking\n- [x] Look for the repeatable proportionalTo bug in recalculation (write a test maybe)\n- [x] Make sure all achievement server tests\n- [x] Run a script to run the achievement plugin post-save logic on everyone (and maybe non-user models, too, if there are any relevant achievements)\n- [x] Recalculate achievements once everything is working and said script is done\n The remaining bug is that increments to things like a user's `stats.gamesPlayed` goes through an update `$inc` operation, not a normal save, so the AchievementPlugin's post-save hook never fires. I can now recalculate them with scripts, but they won't take dynamically.\n Fixed in 87f3b9e.\n  Kills munchkins just fine.  Wielding a hunting rifle.  \n\nThe current line highlighting runs to attack(thrower) and stays there.\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    enemy = self.findNearestEnemy()\n    if enemy.type is \"munchkin\":\n        self.attack(enemy)\n    if enemy.type is \"thrower\":\n        self.attack(enemy)\n```\n Migrated to Level Editor task list for Endangered Burl.\n  We could add a small show/hide button to the spell palette.\n\n![screen shot 2014-11-22 at 9 27 54 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/5154988/0656c268-722a-11e4-993b-5f2232941fc8.png)\n  The fix is in [this line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/295a0e06e935ddc5443b55cf21b88acb141a178e/app/styles/play/menu/game-menu-modal.sass#L90).\n Yeah, you are right.\n  Maybe a few hours to figure out?\n  This may be blocking equipping items, which makes it difficult to test in a local dev env.\n\n![cantequipleatherbelt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/5064717/b2cd8bea-6dc4-11e4-9fa0-5908b9f2ea5c.png)\n  My best guess now is that the GitHub login was what was so buggy about this. It has been disabled for a while and no one has reportedly seen the issue, so I'll close this in favor of just fixing it so we can turn it back on with #1764.\n  As a workaround, you should be able to hit Esc to dismiss the Victory dialog.\n You're right. We have another redesign coming for this focusing on the user experience; we've got some wireframes together, just need to find time to build it.\n Actually, CoCo _is_ a single-page web application (using Backbone) and does not perform a new page load when you go back, instead keeping a lot of data that it had loaded previously.\n  This might have happened because I clicked Play too quickly.  I've seen this state multiple times.\n\n![blankinventorydialog](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4957229/79b7015c-66a2-11e4-9c22-79104cf060dc.png)\n Sometimes I can click outside of the dialog to dismiss it and then continue via 'start level'.\n  ![spellviewunderstartlevel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4957164/fa582eea-66a1-11e4-9eef-43f3a2e3fd9e.png)\n  It works in Opera now.

You have to deal with the fullscreen dialog before you can proceed.\n\nWe should consider making fullscreen an option rather than forcing it.\n\nI found the auto-fullscreen a bit jarring on Chrome as well. \n\n![firefoxfullscreen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4649293/464d03fa-5489-11e4-905e-de73da041841.png)\n Wow, it's really in your face in Firefox. Maybe we should consider moving the loading stuff to the center instead of the top.\n\nIt is jarring, but sometimes necessary to grab all the resolution we can get. I'll make it so that it only happens on really short screens, like if they have a 1366 x 768 11\" MacBook Air but they have some browser toolbars and a dock showing and only 562px vertically visible, where the interface will start to be cut off otherwise. Min threshold at 1366px wide for play view is 658px tall.\n  In the hero selection dialog.  It makes more sense to put the question before the answer, or make it more clearly some sort of subtext to the programming language dropdown.\n ![screenshot 2014-10-15 10 30 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4650101/eb0a2772-5490-11e4-95e5-31ec86e59cff.png)\n  1. Navigate to world map in Firefox\n2. Move mouse close enough to a level dot to bring up the popup, but not close enough to initiate the dot rising/glowing animation\n3. Notice the crazy hide/show flashing popup\n\nThis is fairly noticeable, even if you move your mouse at a normal pace all the way to the level dot.\n\nDoes not repro in Chrome.\n It's almost like when it switches the cursor from hand to pointer, it changes the cursor position, which then moves it out of bounds, which then makes it swap the cursor again, etc. If you look, you can see the two cursors both flashing at different positions. Weird.\n  Thanks @gabrielcesar!\n  Awesome, thanks for those translations, @ikks! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) please so I can merge these in?\n Yup, that worked.\n\nNo, thank you for helping make it happen in Spanish!\n  Thanks @glls!

So if we can get the process started now with a new UI for making those edits, it'll give us plenty of time to use it.\n  Oh man, I forgot to remove it from the template? What would I ever do without you, @Imperadeiro98?\n  Hey @Gkntos, thanks for adding those translations\u2013welcome to the project! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge these in?\n  Thanks @Imperadeiro98. By the way, if any of these i18n tags are confusing to find, now that we have the comment-propagation in there, please do consider adding something to en.coffee to help other Diplomats find and understand things going forward.\n  Thanks @kaktycc!\n  ![ie11realtimenoend](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4514058/356d36fe-4b5b-11e4-8e85-f80ccb0cdbcd.png)\nAfter pressing skip button:\n![ie11realtimenoendskip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4514061/420d737e-4b5b-11e4-9674-ae97ceab0d49.png)\n  \u7ffb\u8bd1\u5730\u5bf9\u3002[\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7535\u8111\u79d1\u5b66](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95_%28%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%B8%29)\n\n\u8c22\u8c22\uff01\n \u636e\u6211\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6ca1\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u8d21\u732e\u5f97\u5bf9\u3002\n  Before\n\n``` javascript\n// Use a loop to both navigate and attack.\nloop {\n    this.moveRight();\n    this.moveUp();\n}\n```\n\nAfter\n\n``` javascript\nloop;\n{\n    this.moveRight();\n    this.moveUp();\n}\n```\n  This is caused by the fix to #1615, and indirectly https://github.com/brunch/sass-brunch/issues/40.\n\nMac/Linux requires sass-brunch 1.7.2 or earlier.

How does a user know they have to go to google.com and sign out, before they can login with a different account?\n3. It makes testing user creation and sign in more difficult.\n\nYou should be able to login with a different account, without having to navigate to another site first.\n\nSuggested changes:\n1. Don't auto-dismiss the login dialog (and maybe don't automatically login with Google)\n2. Auto login with Google on the homepage once, but definitely not if a user has selected logout during the current session.\n  Thanks @kaktycc! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge these translations in?\n  Awesome, thanks for getting the ball rolling on the Bulgarian translations!

Thanks!\n  Thanks @enricpc!\n  Hmm, we don't reload the code for you if you switch languages and have written the solution, only if you just have the default code. We figure players might be sad if their solutions just vanish on language change instead of being able to translate to the new one. And you could hit the reload button in the upper right if you intentionally wanted to get rid of it. What do you think, @javatlacati?\n  They're currently removed for IE here:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/73e49f9972a78361076622af1b409bd7d9dc3c66/app/templates/base.jade#L83\n\nRelated to #1512\n  @james616616 \u8acb\u4f60[\u7c3d\u6211\u5011\u7684CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)\u3002 \u8b1d\u8b1d\uff01\n  In the new levels we do going forward, we aren't going to make code-language-specific hints. The old levels will just have to continue to have JS syntax in the few hints that exist.\n  Which mission?\n @amueller please reopon this issue if it is still a problem for you.  Thanks!\n  Sounds like the same thing as #1749. Let's just fix it as part of re-enabling it with #1764.\n  We need search in the level editor.  It's nearly impossible to find all the instances of a method or property across [components](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component) and [systems](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/System)\n\nFor example, where is `getCooldown()` defined and used?  Eventually you'll find it's definition in the action.Acts Component.  Who knows where it's called.\n\nAdding search will alleviate some of the pain of making code changes in our db-based source control.\n I get a script error when trying that, filed #1573.\n  We need to add support for the remaining programming languages.  JavaScript and Python were initially supported.\n\nInitial commits:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/aether/commit/b599f79f9c3b6d87ad44764d1442209b292545f4\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/3209e4f838b3b669b055eaf3237b6e8a22bf5fc6\n\nSteps:\n1. In [Aether](https://github.com/codecombat/aether), implement `replaceLoops()` for the given programming language\n2. in [CodeCombat](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat), add Ace keyword syntax highlighting\n\nNote that CoffeeScript already has a loop keyword, but still needs an Aether `replaceLoops()` that tracks the correct start range index.\n\nNote that Clojure already has a loop form, and not a good equivalent of while (true).  Therefore, we should hold off adding support to Clojure until we know what would be appropriate for that language.\n @yjw9012, thanks for working on this!\n\n**Testing `replaceLoops`**\nI'm assuming you have a CodeCombat [dev environment](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment) setup.\n\nFirst, I would add some temporary debug output from your CoffeeScript `replacedLoops` to ensure your function is working as expected.\n\nSecond, you'll need to add some tests to make sure CoffeeScript simple loops always yield.  This is handled in the [makeSimpleLoopsYieldAutomatically transform](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/transforms.coffee#L376), and you can check out these test cases for Python and JavaScript:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/test/python_spec.coffee#L422\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/test/es6_spec.coffee#L629\n\nLet me know if it's still unclear how to test `replaceLoops`.\n\n**Python `replaceLoops`**\nIt shouldn't have a 2nd aether argument and should be removed.\n\n**CoffeeScript indentation rules**\nAssume indentation rules similar to Python unless you find otherwise.  If you have a specific indentation scenario you're unclear of, let me know.\n Lua is done, now, too: https://github.com/basicer/aether/commit/3fe72f8e5f348eef4fac2e01f66f69a81b2a0113#diff-097340f7eba6ced75ce0bc69979054b2R23\n\nSo now we need CoffeeScript, Io, and something for Clojure.\n Sure, we just use CoffeeScript's parser, we don't even have to worry about code generation (Aether does that). Adding simple loop for CoffeeScript isn't going to be that difficult, just need someone to sit down, do it, and test it out.\n  This probably isn't important enough to fix now, because we aren't doing much with old-style ladder levels (the ones with the wizards).\n  Component version history is found in the inner chevron menu, when viewing a component in the level editor.\n\nCurrently, to compare changes you check the two changes you want to compare and then scroll all the way to the bottom to click on 'Text Diff Code'.\n\nTwo improvements would be to move the code diff control to the top of the list, and add a short instructional message.\n 1. Add text \"Select two change below to see the difference.\"  below the title that always displays.\n2. Move current diff button from bottom of page to just below title and subtitle.\n\nDo not make an ugly blue button like in the 2nd screenshot.  That's just for reference :)\n\n![componentcomparing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4695293/cedbbb46-57b1-11e4-8433-812164bfb9aa.png)\n![componentcomparing2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/4695294/d06ee1cc-57b1-11e4-8419-3c17117291e9.png)\n You can make a change locally if you create an account and login.\n1.

For the one highlighted, self is 206ms which is very reasonable.\n But if you look down the tree, you see there are more deleteClones, which, in fact, take a long time.\n  @beamnarak Please [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla).\n @beamnarak :notes: _Please, oh please, oh my my, baby please_ :notes: [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  I can't reproduce after the recent autocomplete changes.  Please reopen if you continue to see this.  Thanks!\n  I had it working now; not sure what changed.\n  @ondrej008 Please [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla).\n @ondrej008 :notes: _Please, oh please, oh my my, baby please_ :notes: [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  Duplicate of #1133; gonna just ignore it, as it's in the old-style levels.\n  I'm not saying to make a new request handler\u2013it would be an internal utility function, as you say. It should mirror this client-side utility function: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/core/utils.coffee#L49-L70\n\nTranslations aren't often required on the server side, but sometimes they are\u2013the server will send the client some error message text, say, or insert some text into an email. Of course we haven't translated any of that yet since we don't have the utility function, but [here's one example](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/routes/auth.coffee#L114-L114).\n  Possibly, I'll look into it.\n I think we can simplify things by restricting the API protection to known APIs.  E.g. `var myCoins = this.getItems().slice();` would clone the return from `getItems()`, but not `slice()`.\n\nIn the original example, `foo` and its children would not be protected.\n\nFor `var hehe = {target:enemy}; hehe.target.health = -9001;`, `enemy` should be a clone because it was either an API property or returned from an API method.  Now you can obfuscate it all you want, it's still a clone.\n  @mdzw are you seeing an invalid `this.tileGroups` again, or some other weird bidding behavior?  \n\nIt would be helpful to know if this is the same bug, or a different one.  Thanks!\n  I've got better `NaN` handling in place now, so at least it errors out. Will keep an eye out for scattershot or razor discs continuing to be problems in new hero levels.\n  fyi, the Internet Explorer team provides virtual machines for IE6 and up: https://modern.ie/en-us\nWhich you can use with Oracle's free Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n Fixed via 949f4594af779e7cfcaeda786707b7b1b331032f\n  I've updated the sample code to point out that the archers don't chase in this one if out of range.\n  Looks like this is fixed; just shows no entry, since they have no gold.\n  This appears to be working now.  Please reopen if you continue to see problems.  Thanks!\n  Ah, looking good; thanks @MajkPascal!\n  I just realized that it's really easy to translate attributes like `title`, `placeholder`, etc. using i18next:\n\n``` jade\na(data-i18n=\"[title]common.submit_patch\")\ninput(data-i18n=\"[placeholder]editor.enter_level_name\", placeholder=\"Type in a level name\")\nbutton(data-i18n=\"[title]editor.randomize_terrain;editor.randomize\", title=\"Randomize Terrain\") Randomize\n```\n\nWe should go through the site and add i18n tags for all the title and placeholder attributes found throughout the templates so they can be translated.\n Not that I know. As I find new places without i18n, I add them myself or open an issue, so I think this issue can be closed.\n  Thanks!\n\nI don't want to automatically propagate because often people will commit changes to other langauges that are improperly formatted, and I have to check to make sure I'm not deleting new translations that are still commented out each time I do it.\n  Thanks @torehaug!\n  Wow, nice work\u2013that's a lot of translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n\nWill be happy when we get your mother hooked on programming. :smile: \n  You don't wait around, do you? :smiley:\n  Fixed, thanks!\n  Right, this is a limitation in that the read-only methods are just in JavaScript. Another part of the problem is that the read-only code doesn't appear as read-only (it should be dimmed out, but I guess that got broken).\n I think the read-only stuff is working. We are basically never using read-only code in any levels any more, so I'm going to close this instead of thinking that someday we'll implement read-only Python code.\n  Awesome, thanks @RikardGehlin!\n  Wow, nice work, @djsmith85!\n  You have `a ++` instead of `a++`, which doesn't let it parse. It should give a better error message, it's true.\n\nA few other tips: you also don't initialize the variable `a`, and `@detonate` takes an index, not a coin, and typically in CoffeeScript you would use `is` instead of `==`.\n\nI'm not sure about the `NaN` gold thing yet, but I have that bug written down elsewhere; at some point I'll figure ito ut.\n  Good eye on the unused i18n. We actually need to keep `article_title`, `thang_title`, and `level_title`, so I submitted another commit that does this but keeps those.\n\nThe Achievements Editor is new, actually, but it's an admin-only thing, so we didn't bother linking it from this page.\n  If I copy a Components list from one Thang to another (very useful), all the Components show up as \"Unknown\" (because they aren't loaded), and their schema properties aren't editable either. What can we do to make this work well again\u2013just make sure we have loaded all the Component specified whenever that data changes, and refresh the view whenever a new one is loaded from that?\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-25 13 10 13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4035829/d29d768c-2c93-11e4-9e54-f053e26400e8.png)\n  Fixed by https://github.com/differentmatt/filbert/commit/15fdae5540aa76f0a945ef50de7e2b734c6ca523\n  Perfect, thanks! Nice work.\n Travis CI runs our tests, so you can see if the commit breaks anything. But the tests fail intermittently right now because some of the methods time out, unfortunately, so it's not always reliable.\n  This may be specific to Windows/Chrome. What operating system did you use to check?\n Sounds good to me! Thanks for checking it out.\n  Just was going through every Component in [Greed](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/greed) and got about halfway through before the tab crashed. Probably some memory leak with the ACE views or something like that.\n  Was just messing with performance, using [K-Means++ Cluster Wars](http://localhost:3000/play/level/k-means-cluster-wars) as a test, and saw these two big lag spikes:\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-22 08 15 30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4012616/6dd124e6-2a0f-11e4-9fd2-a6ffa412f688.png)\n\nFirst one is just Aether transpiling things. We have a mechanism for doing this in the background, but I guess we then also do it on the main thread for when we are actually casting. We need to get it back into the background.\n\nSecond one is twofold. First, creating new ThangListEntryViews, which I won't worry about too much, because I'm not sure we'll be keeping that area in the new hero design\u2013your code might always be there instead. Then, Aether retranspiling. Need to work around that especially, because with the new world streaming, it's a really noticeable lag.\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-22 08 16 46](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4012676/d90aceba-2a0f-11e4-879f-dee6769bea80.png)\n  Correct, `splice` returns an array of the removed elements, not the original array.\n  @chess9876543210 have you seen this again since? Do you remember what browser it was in? I found one bug that could have caused this yesterday, but I don't know for sure whether I got it.\n > Uhm... there's seems to be a bug in the leaderboard... I'm both 26th and 27th on multiplayer-treasure-grove (Ogres)\n\nOf course I get another bug report of this the day after I close it. Looks like the logic around being 26th-28th is wrong.\n  Hi @ZephyrSails! Thanks for adding those translations. You can either add them there or in the [zh-HANS.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/zh-HANS.coffee) simplified Chinese translation file.\n\nCan I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? \u8c22\u8c22\uff01\n Yeah, that's a good idea. It's a bit hard for me to include comments in the localization files, since they get programmatically regenerated after parsing, and the comments aren't included. But I'll see what I can do. If you have any particular questions about where a section is, you can ask me here or in [our HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa).\n  I added CoffeeScript and Python. We don't have Clojure, Lua, or Io for Dungeon Arena itself yet, though, so will leave those for when it gets filled in through #1229.\n  It's going to be a huge part of the hero selection process (and the restart session with different hero or language menu), which we haven't finished introducing yet, but there should be ample opportunities to pick your language in the new scheme. After that, we'll probably just remove the one that's currently in the spell palette.\n  Hi @mugenryuk! Thanks for the translations. Can you help with two more things?\n1. Sign our [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so that we can merge this in.\n2. Update the pull request to make sure all the translations line up properly? The indentation is important, otherwise it's a syntax error. Here's an example:\n\n``` coffeescript\n #  units:\n-#    second: \"second\"\n-#    seconds: \"seconds\"\n+    second: \"Segundo\"\n+   seconds: \"Segundos\"\n #    minute: \"minute\"\n #    minutes: \"minutes\"\n #    hour: \"hour\"\n```\n\nYou'd have to uncomment `units`, since it's the header of a section that now has some content in it, and `second` and `seconds` should line up (`seconds` is missing one leading space).\n\nThanks!\n  Hi @Fedorsturov, welcome to CodeCombat! Thanks for adding those translations. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge these in?\n\n@M-r-A care to proofread?\n  Nice work as always! You've made pt-PT into the second-best-translated language, just barely behind ru! See the graphs here: http://codecombat.com/contribute/diplomat\n  Ah, great, looking good! Thanks for adding those translations.\n\n@M-r-A care to proofread?\n  Looks like a bug! Will fix soon.\n Fixed now, thanks guys. It may take a bit for the simulators to catch up with the latest code.\n  This is an API protection issue. I'll also track it [over in Aether](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/103).\n  Right, so this basic, mobile-friendly hamburger menu doesn't include those elements yet:\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-19 11 53 19](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3971276/21a67632-27d2-11e4-9568-bfde49ebe8ea.png)\n  Fixed, should let you load it and add the Programmable Knight now. (It was dying because it couldn't find the Programmable Knight when looking to add the methods for the Template Knight.)\n Are you logged into the same account that created it? You'd have to publish it before non-admins can see it (outside of the creator).\n  Good point! We'd definitely prefer to get it to be a draw, because the default human code and default ogre code should be symmetrical\u2013if humans win by default, then you have the same problem when playing as humans for the first time.\n That would be a good option, but not super straightforward to implement until we get multiple level sessions working well.\n\nTo test defaults, you could either copy your code, reload to default, and paste it in but comment it out (or save it somewhere else), or you could have another test account.\n I tried out your patch, but I think it does imbalance the ogres\u2013it's hard to tell. If I look at how much health/DPS you get per gold unit per soldier, it seems ever so slightly better already than munchkins, although munchkins are slightly faster.\n\nSo instead of making soldiers stronger, I changed the default ogre unit mix to have the same ratio of gold spent on melee and ranged:\n\n``` javascript\nvar buildOrder = ['munchkin', 'munchkin', 'munchkin', 'munchkin', 'thrower', 'munchkin', 'munchkin', 'munchkin'];\n```\n\nThis costs 102 gold, gives 350 munchkin HP, 10.5 munchkin DPS, and one ranged. The human build order is:\n\n``` javascript\nvar buildOrder = ['soldier', 'soldier', 'soldier', 'soldier', 'archer'];\n```\n\nThat costs 105 gold, gives 400 soldier HP, 10 soldier DPS, and one ranged. I have put the thrower in the middle for ogres instead of at the end like humans, because that ends up giving the closest battle, but depending on where I put the thrower in the build order, I can get humans win, ogres win, or various levels of imbalanced draws. So I think the melee units are roughly balanced.\n  Almost\u2013I still need to excise the old menu first.\n  Hi @logicomPL, thanks for adding those translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n  Right, it doesn't work to build Programmable Thangs directly because of the way Programmable Thangs load their code from the level sessions. Instead you have to do what Dungeon Arena or Brawlwood does: you have a \"Template Knight\" and a \"Programmable Knight\". The Programmable Knight has the Programmable configured with chooseAction as a programmable method and your default source, but the Template Knight is the one that you build, and his Programmable has chooseAction as just the string \"Programmable Knight\" to copy it from the original.\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-18 16 05 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3959421/3d7e8486-272c-11e4-94e0-6b4948635370.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-18 16 05 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3959422/437ea9e2-272c-11e4-9720-219d78cf4038.png)\n Programmable and Template Knights can both be `exists: false`. New copies of the Template Knight will be made and set to `exists: true` by the base when it builds them.\n  What username did you try to use to sign up with Discourse? I'll check the logs.\n Right, I get this error when I check to have it send another activation email:\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-19 07 53 52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3967864/3d044f38-27b1-11e4-8685-6cb9d0eb268a.png)\n\n@schmatz debugging ideas?\n\nIn the meantime, I've activated your forum account without the email.\n I think that this is probably not related to something we can control. If Discourse email deliverability fails sometimes, then it'll be hard for us to know or fix it, but they'll know more and be the ones to improve it.\n  Nice work! I adjusted the edge detection to be aware of the ratios involved instead of using absolute meters for it, so looks like this is all good.\n  Nice work as always!\n  Ah, works great\u2013but I wonder if the new Zatanna version has anything to do with this new error I'm seeing?\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-18 13 51 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3957840/87837ad6-2719-11e4-9b7b-4f97ac877446.png)\n\nWhat do you think?\n  Fixed in f1a9848\n  What do you think of [these ones](http://codecombat.com/community)?\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-15 08 25 14](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3934924/621e1444-2490-11e4-87d7-583585ef4704.png)\n\nWe could make a GitHub one to go with them\u2013unless you want it to say \"Log In with Suchandsuch\" on the buttons.\n  All right, nice work!\n\nLast remaining thing, then, is #1381. I think we surely must at least be able to examine the code just before we are inserting the snippet, and if it starts with `this.` and our snippet also does, to just insert the snippet without `this.`?\n We can figure out something general and amazing for when people do that later, but getting this fix in would help a lot in the short term.\n  Sure; done.\n\nBy the way, until we uncomment [the language blurbs](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/pt-PT.coffee#L106-L111), every time I run the script, I have to manually restore those, since anything commented out is overwritten by the script. What do you think we should do so that we can fit those in on the home page in a way that makes sense?\n  Awesome, nice work!\n\nWould it be so bad to leave them as \"humans\" and \"ogres\"? Those strings are used in a lot of places, and it would be a bit tricky to get them to be consistently translated.\n  I like showing the save button next to the chevron. Even better if we can do it when there have been changes made to the Component.\n  Ah, looking good!\n  Thanks @Imperadeiro98! Yeah, the string is right, because the name of the tab in code and the title here are different. (Later the tab will be used outside this context, too.)\n  From [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/dungerous-arena-missing-code/1047):\n\n> I edited my code of Tharin in Dangerous Arena. I pressed Ctrl+z several times,and too much,that there was no code in window. So I restarted my page. And I saw \"Inital code\", no my code. I missed my code.\n> Copy of my original code is in the competition. Can I resume my code? And fix it bag: command \"Ctrl Z\" must cancel last changes, but no delete the code.\n\nI vaguely think I remember looking at the ACE undo API before and not finding a way to mess with this, but maybe there is one. Some workaround is needed, because it's horrible to lose code like that.\n Wow, nice work\u2013very fast!\n Any quick ideas on [this one](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L124-L130)? Basically, shift+space needs to be passed through because some people hold down shift while typing a space in sequences like `) {`, but if there is a script active saying \"Press shift+space to continue\", we then don't want to insert the space if they press it.\n `editor.insert(' ')` sounds pretty simple, actually. That sounds like a plan.\n The ScriptManager state might; not sure. @sderickson may know more.\n  @GlenDC do you have any quick ideas here?\n  @andyhunter Thanks for the heads up. Do you see any similar issues on this site? http://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html\n @andyhunter Still haven't figured this one, but wondering if you are still seeing it now after I've changed a few things related to this?\n Have you overridden the font? It should be using a monospace font; nothing in ACE will work without that (and usually you wouldn't code in a variable-width font).\n\nThis is the font stack it should be using:\n\n> 'Monaco', 'Menlo', 'Ubuntu Mono', 'Consolas', 'source-code-pro', monospace\n @andyhunter Can you try again now (after a cache refresh) in Chrome and Iceweasel with your system font back to normal? I'm trying some additional CSS in 774ae24 to try to force a monospace font.\n  Thanks for doing those translations, @kisik21! And welcome to the CodeCombat project.\n\nThe grey-font ones are ones that are commented out. They weren't translated yet because they were recently added and no one had time to work on them yet. So it's good that you got them!\n\nHowever, in order for the translations to take effect, you have to uncomment them by deleting the leading `#` at the beginning of each line. (Also, if you add a translation in a section that was entirely commented out, you should uncomment the section header, too.) Hope this makes sense. Can you update this pull request to delete the leading `#`s on the lines you translated? Thanks!\n\n@M-r-A care to proofread?\n Thanks for taking the time to edit that, @kisik21! \n  @richardcruceanu hmm, there weren't actually any failing errors in there, so I'm not sure why it didn't load. And it never worked, or worked sometimes? Do you still see the problem?\n @richardcruceanu this is the link to replay that same match: http://codecombat.com/play/spectate/gold-rush?session-one=539dcc7f6e1d92310508bd4b&session-two=53c6a237139e7f37053273d1\n\nCan you try again and let me know if it always happens, or only intermittently?\n  @Vettax still seeing this problem?\n Moved this to the in-level Tasks list.\n  Thanks @jayant1992! :)\n  @txomon If we can get the code that didn't work, we can fix it\u2013are you able to recover it?\n Please reopen if you can still reproduce.  Thanks!\n  Thanks @Melondonut!\n  Hi, I will take a look today.\n So for the original failure, it was some syntax.\n\n```\n#  keyboard_shortcuts:\n    keyboard_shortcuts: \"\ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc \ub2e8\ucd95\ud0a4\"\n    space: \"\uc2a4\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\"\n    enter: \"\uc5d4\ud130\"\n    escape: \"Esc\"\n    cast_spell: \"\ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc758 \uc8fc\ubb38\uc744 \uac81\ub2c8\ub2e4.\"\n#    continue_script: \"Continue past current script.\"\n#    skip_scripts: \"Skip past all skippable scripts.\"\n#    toggle_playback: \"Toggle play/pause.\"\n#    scrub_playback: \"Scrub back and forward through time.\"\n#    single_scrub_playback: \"Scrub back and forward through time by a single frame.\"\n#    scrub_execution: \"Scrub through current spell execution.\"\n#    toggle_debug: \"Toggle debug display.\"\n#    toggle_grid: \"Toggle grid overlay.\"\n#    toggle_pathfinding: \"Toggle pathfinding overlay.\"\n#    beautify: \"Beautify your code by standardizing its formatting.\"\n#    move_wizard: \"Move your Wizard around the level.\"\n```\n\nHere, you must uncomment line 0, `#  keyboard_shortcuts:`. That is because that line specifies a section. So basically, anything that you comment must have every parent line uncommented. The structure is \n\n```\ntranslationGroup:\n  translationThingOne: \"Translation\"\n  translationThingTwo: \"Translation2\"\n```\n\nIf the group is uncommented, the software will think the translation is part of the group above it with an uncommented group name, which might cause duplicate keys like you saw in the TravisCI.\n  Awesome, getting close to finished with pt-PT! Nice work @Imperadeiro98, keep it up. :+1:\n  Font Awesome also has a \"repeat-right\" that could work for redo.\n\nI see that Glyphicons has the icons we need, just not in the Halflings set that Bootstrap uses: http://glyphicons.com/ \u2013 are we allowed to use those here?\n Wanna just ask them?\n Hmm, I guess the other advantage of having them as a font instead of an image spritesheet would be being able to resize/color/scale them arbitrarily, right? That could come in handy.\n @rubenvereecken I guess let's either 1) grab the Metro UI CSS or 2) add the individual glyphicons images, except let's only add the ones that we are actually using to the GitHub repo. It will be relatively easy to pull in more as we need them from the .zip that you can download.\n\nSounds like 1) might be better?\n  Good point; I've removed them and improved the way the server suggests default languages, so more people should be correctly defaulted to the more-complete, country-specific locale files.\n  I'll merge this in shortly.\n Karma crashes my Chrome when trying to execute the test suite, which I assume is unrelated, I merged it in so we can see if it's just my computer or something specific to this commit. \n  I've added `rotation` to the API of all the units in the level.\n  Thanks @dkundel!\n  Hi guys,\n\nThanks for reporting these errors, it's really helpful. Having a stable simulation environment is definitely a priority. It's definitely on my todo list to fix the simulator (after transactional emails, hover debugger, and code score MVP.)\n @rmatte @nemoyatpeace I made some fixes to this to help stop the simulators from slowing down; I think this might be worked around? Can you let me know if you're still seeing this?\n  Hi @greyhusky! Thanks for this, I'll take a look and merge it in shortly.\n  Hi @dariusf,\n\nThanks for reporting this. I'll look into it when I have time. Would you like help setting the dev environment up manually?\n @dariusf hard to say. If you are still getting the errors, can you drop by [the HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa)? If we solve it, we can update the dev setup.\n Closing for now; not sure what the exact issue is or what we can do about it.\n  Hmm, I might have fixed this\u2013is it still happening for you?\n I think it's good now; let me know if you see this again.\n  Removed the confusing part about movement entirely. Now it just says:\n\n> The `attack` method makes the #{spriteName} attack the `target` unit.\n  Great idea @lawrencejohnston! I'll see if I can put this in real quick.\n  @schmatz I was thinking about doing this, but then I didn't. I remember we had talked about the best way forward for this\u2013was it a node module that uses imagemagick / graphicsmagick? Was it an nginx configuration? I forget; do you remember?\n  I've been thinking this would be cool, but then I was also thinking how complex it would be to pull off, especially with some new synchronous and real-time multiplayer modes we're going to be adding. So I'm going to close this one, 'cause I don't see us realistically getting this done, unfortunately.\n  Did you previously sign it? What is the behavior you are expecting?\n\nEDIT: I suppose it shouldn't allow you to get to that step.\n   @rubenvereecken ;)\n  I think this is working now with the latest Component? Closing this in any case, since we're working off a different AoE arc implementation client-side. We can start another issue for any bugs in that. Nice work, @nemoyatpeace!\n  People push directly to master, and when we're ready to deploy we merge into production. This allows us to easily see whatever commits are in production (and which aren't.)\n\nAlso in the future, please post questions on the [Discourse](http://discourse.codecombat.com).\n  I'm on a bug-fixing spree for the next couple days; I hope to get to these ones. I'm not exactly sure if I'll be able to fix these right now, though, because there are a couple weird bugs/interactions with the CoffeeScript Redux compiler and the rest of our transpiler tooling, and I might need to fix one of these things at the source.\n  Having troubles reproducing the problem.\n1. Do you still see this?\n2. Do you use the normal login method (username and password), or have you connected FB / G+?\n3. Do you see this in Firefox, too?\n It really sounds like there's something making it so that the browser can't store your CodeCombat cookies. In Chrome's Settings, open up Advanced Settings, then go to Content Settings. You should see something like this:\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-30 08 12 39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4099332/2632492c-3058-11e4-8812-4b2418a571f3.png)\n\nDo you have it set like I do? Do you have any exceptions listed? And if you go to All Cookies when logged into CodeCombat and search for CodeCombat, do you see something like this?\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-30 08 14 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4099338/6ad0e246-3058-11e4-85d0-d373aedbc7ce.png)\n @Imperadeiro98 still seeing this one?\n Can you install Firefox and try there? Really confused by this one and trying to figure out if it's browser-specific, computer-specific, or CodeCombat-specific.\n Still seeing this one in Chrome and IE on Windows 7 and 8.1.\n\nNote: This happens in direct, http and https.\n Yeah, it is still happening. And yes, my time is correct.\n It happened in all computers I tried (with different accounts).\n  I improved this for the scripts and thangs tabs, but mostly this whole mobile mode for the editor is a mess, so I decided it's not worth continuing to work on. Really, the editor needs to be ~1024px wide or it's not going to work.\n  We should be able to use the new template context i18n stuff to pull this off, like we do in Component property documentation code examples, which have either one main entry, or an entry for each code language, and all the spoken language stuff comes in through template context variables.\n  This seems to work now.  If you continue to see problems, please reopen this issue.  Thanks!\n\nExample from [Dungeons of Kithgard](http://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard)\n\n``` javascript\nif (inner() === 5) \n    this.moveRight();\n\nfunction inner() {\n    return 5;\n}\n```\n  Need any help finding/fixing the bug? Would be nice to be able to merge this one in.\n  Hi Lawrence! Indeed the simulator uses transpiled code.\n\nIt's been a while since I've touched the simulator, but if I'm not mistaken there are two paths forward:\n- Alter the simulator so it transpiles the code at runtime\n- Feed the simulator transpiled code.\n\nWould you like any help from me in moving forward with this?\n  Moved to https://github.com/codecombat/treema/issues/48\n  Thanks for this @dkundel! This looks pretty good; are you confident it won't introduce bugs, or should I test it a bit tomorrow first?\n Awesome :smile: \n  Hi @djsmith85, thanks for letting me know your experience with the setup. \n\nDo you think making a Docker image would be helpful for a lot of users? This would certainly reduce the setup time for a ton of users on Unix based operating systems.\n\nAre you still having trouble?\n Anyone want to add make and build-essentials to the dev setup script (or has it been already), and/or add a Docker or Vagrant-based method?\n  Not only did I move the setting to the game menu options, but we'll be trying removing autocast when we move to the world streaming next.\n  We received a bug report from a user:\n\n\"Your Google+ login is broken on Chrome 35.0.1916.153 m. I was able to log in a couple days ago but now it will just pops up the authentication box and immediately closes. I tried clearing cookies and revoking/reapproving. You probably need to handle the response callback better and actually redirect after successful login.\"\n\nHaven't replicated yet.\n  Not too important now in the plan-based ones, because the action is automatically the one that's highlighted as running.\n  Bam! Done in #1448.\n  Won't do this now, but should figure it out soon after splitting out the game from the normal site. Here's a [link I found](http://www.paulund.co.uk/lazy-load-social-media) with some more info.\n This is (partially?) done recently by @sderickson, but not sure if we went all the way with some of them, like Filepicker.\n  Will fix soon.\n  @Darredevil How about now? We have made a ton more changes to it, and we've all been working with it a lot, but haven't seen the issue.\n  It's in, check it out: http://codecombat.com/user/nick\n\nLet us know if you were thinking something different or have ideas for improvement.\n  Due to the way that [the Facebook API handles logging out](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.logout/) the current logout from Facebook also logs the user out. This can be a bit annoying.\n  Hi @thgil, thank you very much for adding this! \n  The Ghostery extension causes the site not to load due to blocking some of the tracking tools we use. This isn't so much an issue for fixing Ghostery specifically, but making the site redundant to some of the trackers not loading.\n  One of our users reported that Gridmancer was no longer working. Can replicate. Message is below.\n\nI tryed to run my old code for Gridmancer, but nothing is running, and all vars are \"undefined\".\nHere's my code :\nhttp://codecombat.com/play/level/gridmancer?session=52d8694def7d0f986800059d\n\nThrotkar has a red mark :\n\n![Thoktar](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/7494/123d799d73f847348d2d53e4a204ffeb037ab264/f27cdcece04b0d4b65f48c48b40fd07d5aa12275/image.png)\n\nBut there is no error visible in my code.\nAnd the real debugger to count the number of statement is not running anymore.\n Must have resolved itself.\n  I've checked out the Open Badges thing, but it's a bit confusing, and I don't think it's adding enough value for CodeCombat players, so I'm going to close this\u2013not going to implement. If someone is super interested, they can do all the integration work themselves and we'll accept the pull request.\n  I think this has to do with assigning to `target.pos`, which should now be not allowed.\n  Thanks again!\n  Did you try and access over HTTPS? HTTPS in Firefox is broken at the moment due to mixed content.\n Cannot replicate, so closing this issue.\n  This was fixed in 648e05ee343d13b22c9c583af8ee53b746dbf2b2 but I typo'd the issue number.\n Yeah, I pushed it early because I wanted to deploy it. What can I say? I'm a pusher.\n  I'm going to go ahead and close this, since it's only an issue for old-style ladder levels, and I don't want to mess around in the script state restoration bug stuff for those.\n  Actually, we need to just make sure everything is at 4, in the interests of simplicity and not having weird bugs when we do indentation in Aether for Python, write sample code, etc.\n  Oops, that was a typo; I meant issue 1134, not 1124. That commit had nothing to do with this issue.\n  Thanks @kinez!\n  We still have no leads on debugging when this happens, so I think we might try implementing the WebGL-based rendering and seeing if that fixes it.\n @underthecushions Can you try this again and let me know if you still see the problem? We have implemented the new WebGL-based renderer and wondering it exhibits the same bug.\n  Another example issue: #1062 was caused by this, since the [ThangNamesCollection](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/collections/ThangNamesCollection.coffee) loaded the names of ThangTypes that already exist in the level without the `kind` in its projection. (I've just added this, though it doesn't necessarily make sense, since it's in the root Handler and not everything for which we search for names has a `kind` property.) Would've been much better if the incompletely projected data were replaced with the more-completely projected data.\n This is causing a lot of hard-to-debug bugs\u2013this might be better to fix earlier rather than later.\n Just ran into this again, [on this line in LevelLoader](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelLoader.coffee#L82). Couldn't ever see knights I had built after the level started because the ThangType that was loaded was missing required properties, instead having just had this projection. (I'll work around it for now.)\n  It sort of works with plan, and it works with chooseAction a little bit, but the code keeps running. Here's some sample code you can put on a Thang that has a cooldown on its Says Component to see the problem:\n\n``` javascript\nif(typeof this.counter === 'undefined'){\n    this.counter = 0;\n}\nthis.say(\"counter is: \" + this.counter);\nthis.counter++;\n```\n  Here's one bug. @Darredevil was submitting patches to the `existence.Builds` Component, but I wasn't getting any content, and the patches didn't change anything:\n1.

But the patches don't show up in any of the patch categories for that level. Example: [Mobile Artillery](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/mobile-artillery)\n  The hover debugger should probably indicate that your code has stopped running after an error rather than pretend to show variable state from a frame when that code didn't exist. See [this example](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/greed-peon-getitems-array-is-always-empty/759/6):\n\n![](http://scdn-discourse.r.worldssl.net/uploads/codecombat/_optimized/e07/3e9/02ca9c2342_690x387.png)\n\n`items` is `undefined` because the `chooseAction` method was replaced by a no-op after frame 0, when it had an error.\n  Because we [limit the ACE gutter to 40px](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level/tome/spell.sass#L67), it messes with the folding widget buttons that should normally show up to the right of the line numbers such that you can barely see them:\n\n![screenshot 2014-05-26 14 31 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3085874/2581d1fe-e51d-11e3-89e8-b004e2168d8c.png)\n\nWe limit the width of the gutter to save screen space and not extend past the edge of our parchment texture, but this breaks the fold widgets. We should fix it so the fold widgets are usable. (Maybe position them to the left of the line numbers somehow?)\n  \u597d\u6781\u4e86\uff0c\u8c22\u8c22\uff01\n  Oops, now that I try this, I notice that `Cmd+Shift+[` is a shortcut for going back to the previous tab in Mac Chrome, same as `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, and similarly going forward. Ideas for another shortcut we can use instead?\n `Cmd + ,` appears to not only be Chrome's settings menu trigger, but also some ACE configuration shortcut I never knew about. I would be fine overwriting both of them for our single step back as long as it works to prevent the default and ACE shortcuts like that.\n  Ah, great, I'd been meaning to do that for weeks! \n  Correct, try/except not implemented yet.  Tracked here: https://github.com/differentmatt/filbert/issues/14\n  Seems to have been fixed in Treema somewhen; the listed steps no longer demonstrate the problem.\n  Thanks @kinez! I fixed a couple typos when merging this in: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/bda8f10508a6ddbb95209184202429bc5e042dcc\n  It was implemented using a dynamic tweened [ColorFilter](http://createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/ColorFilter.html), but not only are filters really slow, and tweening them even slower, but it prevented the parent layer from being [cached](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/SpriteBoss.coffee#L214), which in the case of Obstacles (walls) is sorely needed.\n  It must be somehow related to this: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee#L105-L112\n  These things:\n\n![screenshot 2014-05-21 13 54 02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3046544/0a2cc4e6-e12a-11e3-8d27-350c3d797468.png)\n\nThey still are trying to filter by category, but now nothing shows up for some of the categories. Something to look into; I bet it's an easy fix. Used to work.\n Was looking at [Greed](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/greed).\n  Hi @rafagomes, thanks for adding those translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n Thanks @rafagomes! Actually, we'd love to see some translations on [the Greed level](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/greed) that we're [running a tournament for](http://blog.codecombat.com/multiplayer-programming-tournament). We haven't explained easily how to find the i18n tags needing work in the level editor yet, but you can see a few in this screenshot:\n\n![screenshot 2014-05-21 11 29 13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3044813/f37f4fca-e115-11e3-98db-f0a16acecf35.png)\n\nYou can then submit a patch and all the people playing the level can play in Brazilian Portuguese when they're doing the level.\n\nJust thought I'd mention it if you're interested in tackling that.\n @rafagomes Yup, worked great! Thanks, I've merged the patch in. In addition to the settings tab, there are some scripts that can be translated in the scripts tab, but it can be kind of hairy to drill down and find the properties with i18n nodes, so watch out.\n Yeah, our [HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa). It doesn't have an IRC integration, unfortunately, unless we add an account for you (which we do for invested Archmages), but the webchat is... tolerable.\n  I checked out the commit that did this: 934c853\n\nIt seems like it probably behaves differently depending on your rank, and at least at some rank (maybe #1, because that's where Michael is), the fix might have been needed?\n Let's just call it good, since @schmatz is on vacation. He can clarify later if it's still an issue.\n  @vickychijwani would know more, actually, as the Clojure support is extremely new and experimental, but this might get you started (or it may be buggy):\n\n``` clojure\n(def base this)\n(def coins (.getItems base))\n(def peasants (.getByType base \"peasant\"))\n\n;; resource gathering\n(doseq [p peasants]\n  (.command base p \"move\" (.pos (.getNearest p coins))))\n\n;; unit building\n(def type (if (zero? [count (.built base))) \"peasant\" \"soldier\"))\n(.build base type)\n```\n I only know Clojure from your CodeCombat sample code, but it seems like converting from Clojure types to JS types, like sequences into arrays, when passing them back into our JS code would make sense; I think that's what the Lua parser did with its tables. When would you not want that, within CodeCombat? Similarly, treating JS objects a little more like Clojure maps might be simpler.\n Don't worry about the statement counter too much; we'll find a way to make it fair, maybe with per-language statement costs or only counting original player code statements. Things that will make  big performance impacts (like 50%+) are bad, but small performance impacts aren't that big a deal. Most CodeCombat levels care nothing about player code performance.\n\nThis is all I got so far for transforming values being passed in and out of player code: [makeProtectAPI](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/transforms.coffee#L186-L203). We might be able to know which identifiers are JS methods by giving Aether a list of available properties on `this`, but that's not in yet.\n  Ah, this is nice! I should've had it dragging from the very beginning. I noticed three bugs:\n1. Doing it the old way\u2013clicking to start adding the Thang\u2013immediately adds a Thang in the middle of the level. We shouldn't add it unless you click again, if you haven't dragged it onto the level.\n2. If you start dragging but then try to cancel, like by dragging it off of the level, then it will place it outside the current level viewport, so you end up with a Thang in the middle of the void instead of no Thang added.\n3. The purpose of the blanket tab content selector was so that if you had a Thang selected for adding, you could click anywhere on the background to unselect it and not add it. That doesn't seem to work any more.\n\nIn general, it's now too easy to accidentally add Thangs and almost impossible to not add a Thang once you have it selected for adding.\n Looking good, looking good! It's hard for me to notice when Nanoscroller isn't integrated into some view, because I don't use a mouse and have a huge screen, so scroll bars are hidden for me most of the time. Others may be better at detecting them. I think it could be added to the two Components lists when editing a particular Thang from within the editor, right?\n\n![screenshot 2014-05-25 09 11 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3077407/5668d426-e427-11e3-9e82-0a00170f76f7.png)\n\nI see the scroll bar not moving only on the Components tab; all other tabs work normally. Is there something different about how it is implemented?\n  @dpen2000 just checked this out, can't reproduce. Can you still see it? Reopen if so and let me know any other details you have.\n  A user contacted me on Olark after the recovery password didn't work. I tried it and confirmed it didn't work, and also sent another one which also didn't work. Email address was correct. We should double-check that the recovery password system is working in general.\n  Thanks; closing in favor of #1041, which also contains these fixes.\n  Hi @Shpionus, thanks for adding those translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n\nAlso, when you make translations, it's best to remove the `#` at the beginning of each line that you translate to uncomment them so that they can be used\u2013could you update that?\n Sure, that would be great! It might be possible to update this one using the GitHub web editor, but just do whatever's easiest and I'll get it sorted.\n Awesome, thanks!\n\n@M-r-A care to review?\n Good to merge?\n  Probably we need to convert some `canvasToSurface` call to a `screenToSurface` call somewhere.\n  From [HN comment by asselinpaul](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7774096):\n\n```\nAlso, getting coordinates on the map is usually quite tedious (it doesn't seam to work all the time).\n```\n\nPerhaps something is unreliable about the keyboard focus or event handling of the shift+click-to-insert-coordinates feature.\n  Remember not to use this to simulate real games until we figure out the bug where it treats Programmable problems differently than the other Simulator.\n  Thanks @gutierri! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  The solution to this, which has already been implemented everywhere I can tell, is to pair any submittable forms with a `'submit form': 'onSubmitForm'` event listener, which then calls `e.preventDefault()` on the submit event `e`. So we just keep in mind that for new forms, we should do the same thing.\n  Hi @zeus1200, thanks for adding those translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n Thanks @zeus1200!\n  I'm thinking this is fixed; I can't reproduce with any mixture of Facebook login status and spectate mode.\n  Lot of merge commits in here. We had some discussion of whether to merge, rebase, or just change the one word that's different in the HipChat, so that I would know for the future. I don't think I understand any better, so I just decided to implement this in 7811bda.\n  We currently have some ad-hoc code in certain Components providing user-facing methods to look at the arguments and throw some custom ArgumentErrors when the player calls the methods with the wrong arguments. This code is not very nice to write, though, and as a result it's not in many places. Also, when we are manually adding it in like that, we can't easily just not run it when it's being called from within the world, so we lose performance most of the places we would add argument validation.\n\nIf we can come up with some sort of scheme to more automatically enable argument and return value validation, and only when a player is directly calling it, then all this would be much nicer. Perhaps we can lean on Aether to do some of the work for us, too.\n  It doesn't let you filter them, but it shows all yours at the top, highlighted, and also now sorted by last edit date after that.\n  Should be fixed in Aether 0.2.3.\n  I like it, but I think we should make it an option depending on some System's config, maybe Existence or Programming. That way we can alternate between always using 0 as the seed, seeding based on the user code, or seeding based on the player ID or player session ID. The last ones would allow us to make really randomized starting conditions for a level different for every player, or make multiple copies of the same level for a player.\n Say I don't want some levels to change the random components when the player's code changes, because the level shouldn't change under the player as they change their code, but they should get a different initial configuration per different sessions. Everything that determines on randomness needs to deterministically work based on that seed, not just the things that have been retrofitted to use this other random number generator. Allowing configuration through a System gives that control. The default should probably be seed 0, I think.\n  I have no idea why this is happening; will have to investigate the bug. The offset property should just add X frames to the final target playback scrub frame (usually so that when you try to go to frame 0, it's not exactly frame 0, which is sometimes not as fully instantiated as frame 1). But we might want to start defaulting it to 0, since I don't know that is still much of a problem.\n I couldn't reproduce this any more (tried deleting the scrub offsets, too), so I'm going to guess that it's fixed?\n  I just finished removing the `requiresThis` stuff, since when we tested not requiring it in the very early beginner levels, it caused more confusion than it was worth. If we want to ease people into it, we'll just implement another language with Aether instead of JavaScript.\n\nThe `this` is actually here caused by [this line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_palette_view.coffee#L74):\n\n``` coffeescript\n    shortenize = count > 6\n```\n\nIf there are more than six properties, we shortenize and drop the this(), so that we can make sure everything fits even on a small screen. Richard has the if/else and function snippets in this level, pushing him over, whereas the other ones don't.\n  Is this the same bug as #453? Does Simlish ever load for a script dialogue?\n Looks like my fix for #453 got this, too.\n  Thanks @RoyXue!\n  Pretty sweet; I added many comments, but just had time to read the code so far. What's the best way to actually test it?\n  Tested this out, seems to work great. Thanks for digging on that one!\n  Cool, got this in. By the way, you can do this easier like so:\n\n``` coffeescript\nstate[progressObjectName] ?= {}\n```\n  @rubenvereecken up for routing the HipChat API requests through the CodeCombat server so as to not expose the API key?\n  Thanks @Vic020!\n  @RoyXue \u8c22\u8c22\uff01\u8bf7\u4f60[\u7b7e\u6211\u4eec\u7684 CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla).\n  @gosnat I tried the patch, but it didn't affect the issue. `apiMethods` is more for calling methods on other units; `programmableProperties` should be the thing taking care of it in this case.\n\nThe weird thing is that when failing on `this.pickMushroom()`, it's not saying that `pickMushroom` is undefined, it's saying that `this` is undefined! What's going on there? Hmm.\n  Wow, this is one of the most complete translations now, seemingly overnight as if by magic! Nice work.\n  Eventually we will want everything _player-facing_ to be fully localized, so making up local words to match our made-up Englishy words will be good.\n\nHowever, for less accessible things like the Level Editor and Thang Editor, interchangeability and collaboration are more important. For the term \"Thang\" in particular, players never see it until they get into the editors, at which point it's pretty much a standard term (used in URLs and in the code).\n  Just a random idea I had. It would be interesting to see how many people had played each level on the /play levels list.\n  You currently [can't play Rescue Mission in Safari](http://codecombat.com/play/level/rescue-mission) because of an `\"Attempted to assign to readonly property\"` error while building spritesheets (so the level never finishes loading).\n\nI saw [this issue in TweenJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/TweenJS/issues/31), which seems related. It seems to be happening in [this line](https://github.com/CreateJS/TweenJS/blob/master/src/tweenjs/Tween.js#L335). Maybe one of our libraries or our code somewhere is sealing an object?\n\n@sderickson perhaps we should update our fork of TweenJS to either not be in strict mode or to otherwise fix it, unless we can find what might be sealing events and not seal those instead.\n  Thanks for figuring that out! I've accepted the patch and then kerjiggered the Ogre Munchkin F maxSpeed.\n  Turns out they didn't have their `idle` action set up. Fixed now; thanks!\n  Wow, this is an amazing number of translations! Nice work! After a bit of research, I have moved them into zh-WUU-HANS.coffee and zh-WUU-HANT.coffee. I think that'll work best. I had to fork our [i18next](https://github.com/nwinter/i18next) library to add support for three-part language codes, though. Phew.\n\n\u8b1d\u8b1d\u5102\uff01\n  Good idea. You know, here's one thing I was thinking\u2013what about combining them into one unified log-in-or-sign-up modal? Here are the current ones:\n\n![screenshot 2014-05-01 08 32 25](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2853578/e85c0550-d145-11e3-9a2c-0b95fd1094b4.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-05-01 08 32 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2853580/ec60a0de-d145-11e3-8142-0c93f367ef49.png)\n\nSame two fields, plus some checkboxes. What if we detect whether the email is already signed up with a quick debounced check on the login, and if it's a) a valid email and b) not registered, we start displaying the two checkboxes for the announcement emails and pestilent 13+ check? And if it is registered, those are hidden and instead the recover password link appears.\n\nWhat do y'all think? It would make the login/signup code more complicated, but it would forestall us having to make this choice of whether to use the login or the signup on any login-gated areas.\n  There are a few spots that use `addResourceToLoad`, for instance:\n`@addResourceToLoad @user, 'user_profile'`\n\nThis has been deprecated and breaks whatever code uses it. As a quick fix, in the profile view I wrote \n\n```\n  @user.fetch()\n  @listenTo @user, \"sync\", =>\n    @render()\n```\n\nIs there a better way to do this?\n  I think this is because it's trying to play an action for `say`, but it doesn't have one, so it doesn't switch the action. It should probably do `idle` instead.\n  I see the double-Thang-add problem in Chrome, yes. (Haven't tried Firebug.)\n  Oops, thanks for fixing that!\n  @M-r-A I went through and added several i18n tags we were missing. For some, we had the tags in the templates but had forgotten to add them to en.coffee.\n\nA bunch of stuff in the job profile / employers view isn't easily localized right now, because we don't have a good way of localizing Treema field titles, but I figured we can worry about that later when we have a significant number of non-English-speaking candidates and employers.\n\nNote also that we're not localizing http://codecombat.com/community yet because it's kind of in placeholder mode. We have a slightly better design to be implemented soon.\n  I noticed that somehow the height is getting set to 20px, so it's probably something to do with some code that tries to dynamically adjust the height of that sidebar.\n I noticed it too. I think it has to do with https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/906, so any fix would need to make sure that still works.\n  Is this still a problem, or did the pull request earlier fix it?\n  Hi @belian, thanks for adding those translations! I saw a couple indentation inconsistencies, so I fixed them up and have merged it in. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  Tested this out, and I couldn't repro\u2013I think Scott fixed this with his upgraded Component-dependency-remover code.\n  Thanks for fixing that up @dpen2000!\n  Nice work, as always!\n  I can enter a string, such as \"asdfasdfasdfasdf\" for email and register an account. We need some email validation.\n I wonder if it's worthwhile to require the player to verify her email address. It's kind of annoying to have to do, no? I can see why you would want to for a service where it would be really bad if you typo'd it and lost access to your account, but on CodeCombat it's not like you pay us or we care if you create multiple accounts.\n\nWhat are the other reasons we might want to do this?\n Let's use the built-in HTML5 validation stuff on the client, and the simple regex on the server, and throw some sort of error if they somehow submit an invalid email to the server anyway. Hopefully we can test and make sure that it makes sense on the front-end if they somehow do that.\n Ya\n Well, this covers the client side of it, but not the server side yet.\n That's built into (some) browsers and isn't as restrictive as we wanted\u2013lots of \"soandso@gmail\" (without the .com) emails being signed up, for example. So we added another layer that would be a little more aggressive.\n\nWe should use the same regex on the server, too.\n Nah, let's keep that one in as the first line of defense\u2013that one is more standardized and visible.\n We do not have our JSON-schema validator, tv4, set up to enforce an email format. We do, however, reject signups now that don't fit a simple regex.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/core/CreateAccountModal.coffee#L86-L87\n\nSo this issue is resolved.\n  I _think_ this is the expected behavior. In the first screenshot, you haven't added the configuration yet. And then when you add it, you should be able to edit any of those properties, either in the dropdown, or added by default.\n\nThen again, this may be a result of how treema and the site handles defaults being kind of haphazard. If we implement #887, then the treema would show all these default values, but grayed out until you fill them in manually. Would that reflect better how you imagine it working?\n No worries, thanks for helping us find issues with the level editor!\n  Hi @lordbam, thanks for adding so, so many translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  Nicely done! I just saw one minor issue: when you go to tabs with selection on the left, like the systems or components or scripts tabs, the selection treema is open, when it should be closed by default (and it looks like it half thinks it's closed, because it takes two button clicks to close it). Here's an example of clicking scripts on rescue mission:\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-24 at 1 27 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/204723/2794609/d910b20a-cbee-11e3-8909-b754e8066ac1.png)\n @tmrdja Yes the canvas is set to a specific height and width in [thangs_tab.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/editor/level/thangs_tab.jade) and then the width of the canvas is set to fill the canvas-wrapper in [thangs_tab.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/editor/level/thangs_tab.sass). If we want the size of the canvas to be able to change, there'll probably need to be some work done on  [Camera.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/Camera.coffee).\n  @nwinter Take note: I believe this is because of the gridfs overwrite problem. A user submits a picture, then submits another of the same name and it returns a 409. What do we do in this situation? Rename the file automatically? Overwrite the old one? Ask for a different file name? Ask for confirmation to overwrite the old file? Provide a dropdown to choose from a set of files that exist in that filepath?\n\nThis bug might be something else, though, not sure. I think in this case what I'll do is:\n- If there is a conflict, tell the user there is one.\n- If they uploaded that file, or is an admin, they can overwrite it.\n- In whether they uploaded the original or not, they can rename the file to something different.\n Overwriting the old file seems like it would work fine to me for a while, but the proposed solution would be useful.\n Overwriting set up. Envisioned a replacement view and described it in #909 \n  Aww yeah!\n  Thanks @marianoluzza!\n  Thanks @julycoolwind!\n  Typo: you put in 'portait' instead of 'portrait'\n  I think this used to work a while ago, where it would grab new Components for the list when they were added to Thangs, but now it no longer updates.\n  Thanks @treby!\n  If I add \"rotationType\" (either \"fixed\" or \"isometric\", the two possible values) to a ThangType in the Thang Editor, I can then no longer delete them to get back to the default value of free rotation. We should probably have a \"free\" default value, and we should also be able to delete properties in the Thang Editor to let us get back to defaults.\n Yeah, it deletes the `rotationType` property from the Treema, but when you save the ThangType, it comes back.\n\nThe Human Barracks is absurdly complex and takes forever to render, which has to happen every time you change something, so we'll have to do something about that to simplifiy/speed things up.\n It has to do with the fact that PUT acts a lot like PATCH in the server. So\nif you submit only a few properties, the rest of the object isn't\noverridden. We need some way to signal to the server that a property needs\nto be removed. Should probably also add a value to the enum for this\nrotation behavior. Either would fix this instance of the problem.\n\nOn Tue, Apr 22, 2014 at 7:11 PM, Nick Winter notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Yeah, it deletes the rotationType property from the Treema, but when you\n> save the ThangType, it comes back.\n> \n> The Human Barracks is absurdly complex and takes forever to render, which\n> has to happen every time you change something, so we'll have to do\n> something about that to simplifiy/speed things up.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/888#issuecomment-41117651\n> .\n\n## \n\n-Scott\n\nBlog http://scotterickson.info/wordpress/\nCodeCombat http://codecombat.com/\n  I only run the script periodically, and I had gotten behind.\n  @nwinter is this intended behavior?\n I think we should keep it, as it provides a useful feature, but probably change the text of the button\n Totally temporary thing that we needed. I want to leave it as crappy as possible to encourage us to implement the cool D3 crossfilter histogram sweeping thing to really do pagination on this table.\n D3 crossfilter thing likely isn't going to happen soon. I'll change it to \"More\" for now, with the intention that it will be replaced one day when there is time.\n  Currently we have a bit of a hack solution where what you select can be copied and pasted. So you can copy a row and now you've got the JSON in your clipboard and you can put it somewhere else, edit it, and then paste it back into the Treema. This could be improved though, it often doesn't work correctly.\n\nIt would be much better to have a dedicated interface for making translations, which I've been talking about with Ruben. This will be addressed in issue #65 \n\nI think better than doing this JSON thing would be to find ways to improve the existing treema interface in a way that would make adding dialogues easier, if that's a major problem, like by creating custom Treema nodes. Editing JSON directly has its own problems, namely you don't have any guidance or autocomplete. Even as the person who built this whole system and defined the data, I wouldn't want to write in JSON because I wouldn't remember what the property names or structures are myself.\n\nHaving said that, this would be a good feature to have in general for Treema. I'll add an issue in Treema to be able to switch back and forth between Treema and raw JSON edit mode.\n  Oh yeah, Jasper also brought this up for scripts, apparently there are large swaths of the editor that are not editable, which makes submitting patches a bit tricky.\n\nWe should keep readOnly if me.get('anonymous'), though. Anonymous visitors should be able to view the editor, but not submit changes. If you could go through and find the readOnly properties left throughout the level editor and change them to being based on anonymity, that'd be great.\n  Wow, what a great translation effort! Thanks for polishing all those off. Nice work!\n  @kinez thanks for the new translations. You might want to look at this: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork\n\nIt seems like your fork has lost the last half of the hu.coffee file containing the pending translations to do, so you might want to sync it with CodeCombat's master or fork a fresh copy.\n  Hmm, that's a pretty bad memory leak. Do you see the same problems if you add `&skip_flow` to the end of the URL, like this? \n\nhttp://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeon-arena/?team=humans&opponent=533b508b93b95d9319a5b500&skip_flow=true\n Okay, good to know. Michael is working on destroying the obscenely unperformant way in which I had originally implemented that feature and replacing it with a soft, melodious hero approach. We'll see how it plays when that's done.\n  Do I need to perform the one-time fix before or after merging this commit into production?\n Sounds good! \n  Perhaps we should leave the old editors page in for now until we figure out exactly what we're doing with it and with the community page. It may be that they diverge in purpose, and if the editor gets good enough, we can put it back up in the top nav.\n  Merged!\n\nDid some testing, here's what I found:\n- The loading screen is back in action, just one minor bug left: it doesn't say what the error is anymore, it just always says 'unknown error'. It should say \"Connection failed.\" or \"Not found.\" or something like that, depending on the error response code. The same testing code I put in Handler.coffee can be used to test this.\n- The ladder view is now loading all components and systems for a level, fully populating it. The ladder view should only load the level itself. It's probably because it's inadvertently running the loading code which should only be happening for views like the editor or play view.\n- Are you running brunch while you're making these changes? With the last pull request and this one, there were some syntax issues brunch reported. In this case it was just a function which was indented too much. If you're running brunch, you should be seeing these errors too, are you not? This is what I got:\n\n`21 Apr 11:33:51 - error: Linting of 'app/views/editor/thang/edit.coffee' failed. error: indentation at line 53.Expected 2 got 4`\n- You can remove schema loading in SuperModel, since that's been removed with the refactoring of schemas into /app/schemas.\n- `addModelRefencesToLoad` is a typo. Should be `addModelReferencesToLoad`\n- How come onLoaded in CocoView doesn't do anything anymore? Shouldn't it re-render the view having gotten everything loaded? A bunch of views now have it overridden with more empty onLoaded functions. Or how are you thinking views get re-rendered after everything's loaded?\n\nOverall I'm liking this sort of interface for loading, having it in the SuperModel. In general keep trying to simplify things as much as possible. You've really gone down the rabbit hole picking this to refactor! It's definitely making progress, though.\n @gintau I've got some work in the near future to do to improve loading times, which is going to involve some refactoring of SuperModel. Mind if I take over this branch for a bit to make some major changes? I don't see any changes since this pull request was pulled in, but if you've got anything local to push send it my way.\n  Thanks, @julycoolwind!\n  Hi @treby, thanks for adding those translations. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n Great, thanks! If you would like, you can also add yourself to the [Diplomats list](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/contribute/diplomat.jade#L68).\n  Thanks @M-r-A!\n  It looks a bit wonky fixed in the upper right corner of the screen, its parent container blocks mouse inputs, and it's still confusing to people that the settings are saved. Noty seems like a better choice for letting people know when their changes are saved.\n\nAlternatively we could change it to not be automatic, and have people press a submit button.\n  Hi @sky10p, thanks for adding those translations. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in? Thanks!\n  Oops, I didn't see this pull request but did see the problem, so I committed the same fix in a88089b. We think alike!\n  Not sure how that got in there\u2013thanks for solving it!\n  You're not pressing `ctrl+s` or `cmd+s` by any chance, are you @antomy? We intercept those shortcuts (which normally try to save the page) to cast the spell [in SpellView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee#L97-L100).\n\n``` coffeescript\n    addCommand\n      name: 'run-code'\n      bindKey: {win: 'Shift-Enter|Ctrl-Enter|Ctrl-S', mac: 'Shift-Enter|Command-Enter|Ctrl-Enter|Command-S|Ctrl-S'}\n      exec: -> Backbone.Mediator.publish 'tome:manual-cast', {}\n```\n\nWe also do things like that for `ctrl+p`, `ctrl+g`, etc.; does pressing `g` and `p` work? Is your keyboard set to some other layout?\n  Thanks @onion7878!\n  Fixed with d5b0a83\n  I can confirm loading works again. Nicely done! That's some wonky code to figure out.\n\nThere are still some things that need to be done before this can be merged into master though, here's a list:\n1. We seem to have lost the progress bar and retry mechanisms from before. I've added [a line to Handler](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/995b163442f61f06fe3ecc878928dcca29eb0fa7/server/commons/Handler.coffee#L86) for testing. When I use this on the new loading system and I get this:\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-16 at 8 07 01 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/204723/2721174/d6426270-c578-11e3-9d38-799ff8b75ed2.png)\n\nBut when I do this on master right now, I get this:\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-16 at 8 09 19 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/204723/2721192/1e73441a-c579-11e3-9b0f-e2a4749bfa01.png)\n\nThe main view hidden, a \"Loading...\" header, a progress bar, a description of what went wrong, why it went wrong, and a button to give it another try.\n1. In patches_view.coffee, name loading won't work, I think, will it? You can't describe what names you need until the patches have arrived.\n2. Remove the dependency stuff, or change how it works. The two times it's used (patches_view.coffee and /app/views/editor/thang/edit.coffee), the logic needs to be redone to have the first resource load first before the second resource is even created, because the second resource URL or model arguments depend on what the first resource returns. You simply can't add dependent resources at the same time, unless you do something with callbacks one way or another.\n3. Need to merge in changes from the main branch. I tried to do it but there were a mess of conflicts again.\n\nThanks again for working on this! Again, if you have any questions as you're doing this, don't hesitate to come by our [public HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa). This is a complex process and more communication will probably make it easier for us to stay in sync on what is needed. You're clearly putting a lot of time into this, and I don't want it to go to waste!\n  Fixed in b9a978d. One day I'll remember to put the issue number in the commit message.\n  Ah, I always do this! Thanks for catching that.\n\nBy the way, what happened such that something didn't load from local storage?\n  Cool, thanks!\n  Hi @dpen2000, I'll double check this sometime within the next 24 hours for database performance issues then merge it in. Looks pretty awesome, thanks! :+1: \n It's not working out of the box, it truncates at 2 players. I will try and debug this code later today (I'm sure it's just a typo somewhere.)\n Looks awesome! Thanks for the contribution :smile:\n  Excellent! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  Wouldn't we want some measure of accountability? There's going to need to be some way to track who's doing what simulations, so that if there are conflicts we can know who's submitting the conflicts. I think a system along the lines of StackOverflow would be good, where users get [privileges](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges) as they accrue points. That way important things, like judging games, is not too easy to game.\n Yep, that's another solution, and yes, I think it's something to keep in mind and be on the lookout for solutions for. We can remove it for now, but I think a better (although more time consuming) solution would be to make signing in through the API easier, or turn on OAuth2 with [passport](http://passportjs.org/), which is already installed.\n  Thanks @julycoolwind!\n  Looks good to me, but @sderickson should probably double-check. As far as warning the user about a name reset: that could be nice, but we might not need it right away; after all, this is probably going to happen very rarely. She can always rename herself if she wonders where her name went.\n I recommend adding some server-side tests to make sure this works the way we want. @adi2412  have you worked with the server tests before?\n I just checked on the status of the server side tests and there were a couple issues. I've fixed them in 06a61d214e56b10384176c6ad14fd79bc0cc075a, so now they should run.\n Sure, you want to add tests in the /test/server folder, probably /test/server/functional/user.spec.coffee, see what's already there and add to it, running tests like what happens when two anonymous users of the same name are created, and then one signs up and the other signs up. Run the tests by having mongo server running, the test server running, and the server test runner running. Those are coco-mongodb, coco-test-server and coco-server-test-runner respectively in /bin. The test server should reload when you change things in /server, and the test runner should rerun when you change things in /test/server.\n Any luck getting set up with those tests, @adi2412?\n  @dpen2000 nice work! I love it. Ten-year-old TJ (@makertech81) in third place with the simulation counts and climbing!\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-13 15 32 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2690699/9b905516-c35b-11e3-9862-7a3c8d6d8f00.png)\n\nSo happy that this is in. I couldn't resist implementing some bugfixes in af0b8aa; might want to check that out. I got your i18n tags in there np, too. When we're satisfied with them, I can run the script to propagate them to the other languages.\n\nI can think of two main improvements:\n1. Refactor the Simulate tab logic into its own view and template, now that it's a bit more hefty.\n2. Implement the `getMyLeaderboardRank` stuff that the Level has for its LevelSession ranking so that we can put rank numbers into the leaderboard.\n\nInterested in improving it further?\n I also noticed that sometimes, if you are not in the top 20, then sometimes the top 10 don't show up. Not sure why that is, but something to watch out for.\n  Much of vendor is Aether and its dependencies. We could break that out and load it when you start playing, or after the landing page loads. [PreloadJS](http://www.createjs.com/Docs/PreloadJS/modules/PreloadJS.html) could be used for this purpose.\n  \u6b22\u8fce\uff01\u82e5\u679c\u60f3\u591a\u804a\u5929\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684 [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa) \u6216[\u8bba\u575b](http://discourse.codecombat.com/)\u5728\u8c08\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7528\u82f1\u6587\u3002\n  Great work! This will simplify things on the client a great deal.\n  From #468. Basically, when you go to name your wizard, it'll report that the name is taken even if it was just someone who put their name in anonymously and never signed up (which is a lot of names). Since these players will likely never return, we should allow the first player to register an account with the name to claim it.\n#### Implementation\n1. In the [nameToID route](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/users/user_handler.coffee#L152-L155), we should just ignore the name collisions when the colliders are anonymous (perhaps only if we pass an `ignore-anonymous` parameter or something).\n2. We'll then also have to check the name for collision on registered user signup and null it out if someone else has claimed the name in the interim.\n3. There might be a database index reshuffle step, but we can take care of that if someone wants to add the handling for making anonymous users not claim the names. Not sure if there is a unique index on name or not. Might want an index on anonymous + name.\n Maybe? In absence of trying it and testing, I'll leave it to @sderickson or @schmatz to point out any flaws. I would wonder if database indexes need changing. Also, we should probably not throw a 500 if the name conflicts on signup, but rather clear the name, because it's not like they have a field to enter the username at the very form where they are signing up (it is just email and password).\n  If someone is running with a version of the simulator that is too old, we should make them reload the latest version.\n  Looking good! I like having this stuff in the supermodel, and the general structure of the Resource superclass and its subclasses. Here are my suggestions for tweaks:\n- It looks like all the dependency logic is just for deferring model loading after schema loading. It'd be better to get [this issue](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/27) done to obviate the need for managing dependencies. Unless, are there other reasons to have this system? If we can get away without having this dependency system that'd be good for the sake of simplicity; that's a fair bit of the new logic for a need we are trying to get rid of.\n- Callbacks for listenTo and listenToOnce are using => when they don't need to. Backbone automatically binds the listener to the callback. The Deferred callbacks do need => though.\n- Name shouldn't be used as a key, or sourced from things like urls. The name is meant to be the key for the name of the resource, looked up in [en.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/en.coffee#L610). And you may add multiple resources with the same name sometimes. If resources need their own keys (I don't see any logic needing keys except the dependency system, which if we got rid of would mean we don't need keys and can just store the resources in an array) then they should be auto-generated based on the name, like by tacking a number to the end of the name, rather than checking for name conflicts.\n\nA few style tweaks\n- Function arrows should have a space after their parameters list.\n- Functions without parameters don't need parentheses.\n- Don't use `==`, use `is`.\n- Variable names shouldn't have underscores, they should all be camelCase.\n\nI don't think you should move the view logic from CocoView to RootView. Subviews should have their own loading logic sometimes. Take the ladder view, for example. The root view loads, and then the tab loads, and in the future we're going to break out the social network loading into a subview within the tab which also loads independently. This allows flexibility so pages can load gradually and less important parts don't block the rest of the page. It also means parts of the page can reload independently of the rest of the page. CocoModal also needs this functionality.\n\nThese changes have broken the [ladder view](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/ladder_view.coffee) and its [ladder tab view](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/ladder/ladder_tab.coffee). I recommend migrating it to your new system and making sure it works with that, including handling errors, before nailing it down and implementing it for other views.\n\nI'll merge this into this branch, along with the latest updates from master, so we can work from there.\n\nBy the way, if you have any questions, feel free to drop by our [HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa). We're there throughout the PST day.\n That's what `continue if @models[refURL]` handles, I believe. It should prevent duplicates of any kind of model getting loaded.\n\nI just merged [Aditya's refactoring of schemas] into master. You might want to merge master into feature/loading-views and resolve conflicts, and then the lack of schema loading will simplify things.\n You might need `bower install` instead of `bower update`. Also, try deleting the `public` folder, then restarting brunch.\n  Some programmables are common, and they need to be saved into the session. The first level to have this is Alexandru's Resource Gathering Multiplayer level. I [wrote a fix](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelBus.coffee#L115) but it's quite the hack, so this needs to be refactored so the logic is as follows: `if spellTeam is me.team or spellTeam isnt opponent.team`. The only bit to figure out is how to get the opponent's session in the LevelBus.\n @adi2412 That sounds like a good way to do it!\n  Thanks for the detailed bug report, @1c7. I've been trying to reproduce this, but I can't, so I'm guessing it has been fixed since then. If you can still reproduce it, let me know.\n  TJ found that if you enter a name that is 24 characters long and can be converted into a MongoDB ObjectId, the server throws an error. In [`server/plugins/plugins.coffee`](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/plugins/plugins.coffee#L26) you can find this check.\n\nIs this desired behavior?\n I think this is probably a non-issue, as so far as I know, the name and ID never interact. The only exception that I can think of is probably looking up user pages by slug and by ID. @sderickson is this an issue that should be fixed, or should I close this?\n Yeah, this is desired. Otherwise the /db/<model>/<id_or_slug> url would be ambiguous.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/commons/Handler.coffee#L288\n  Thanks for correcting that oversight, @adi2412! We can always improve the styling later if we think of a better design.\n  Nice work; I'd been meaning to fire up my Youku account, but it always takes me forever to read all the menus.\n\nIs there an option we can pass to the embed to not show video previews of other videos at the end?\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-11 10 34 31](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2683019/072712ce-c1a4-11e3-81af-676f2c52b7ce.png)\n Oh well, worth a shot. Thanks for taking a look!\n  Oh, I know what to do! Will fix soon.\n  See [this forum thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/say-command-inconsistent/619). I need to use the data as well as the message to determine if a Thang has heard the message before.\n @kennethkalmer If you open the level editor for any level that has a Thang that has the `hearing.Says` Component in it, like [Greed](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/greed) then you can go to the Components tab, open the Says Component, and check out its source.\n  Doesn't look like that screenshot came through all right\u2013can you edit the issue and try again?\n Very strange. It really sounds like this might be a browser extension problem, a virus, or some other strange thing going on with your computer. If you try signing in using Google Chrome instead of Safari, potentially in incognito mode, do you see similar problems?\n\nPlease reopen if it still persists in Chrome.\n  Nope, it's a bug. Duplicate of #741.\n  Very nice work on this one. Translations are spreading to the furthest reaches of the CodeCombat universe.\n  Much cleaner, thanks!\n  Thanks kinez! Appreciate the translations. Next time, if you delete the `#` at the beginning of the lines you translate to uncomment them, it will be easier.\n  Ah, good eye! Fixed; thanks for reporting that one.\n  What error does it show? If it's a duplicate key error, you have a few options:\n1. Drop the databases and restore\n2. Delete the metadata files of the collections throwing the error\n3. Recreate the indexes with the `dropDups: true` option\n\nI think you also might be able to use the --drop option of mongorestore. \n  Try deleting your `codecombat/public` folder and restarting brunch. We made a change to use `main.html`, which will have the auth inserted into it, instead of `index.html`, but the old `index.html` may still be there in your compiled output, and brunch doesn't delete old files, only overwrites them.\n  Added a new loading system for views in 3b3b825be06bb8ddaf98b59c21af3199a595f7e5. This handles the loading of resources like documents or arbitrary http requests or other asynchronous tasks that need to happen before a view can be fully displayed.\n\nThe old way was to:\n- Set `startsLoading` to true for the view, which tells the view to show a progress bar.\n- Go about handling all the async work manually\n- When it's all done, set `startsLoading` to false and call `render` again, which will load the view without the progress bar.\n\nThe new way is to:\n- Use `addResourceToLoad`, `addRequestToLoad`, `addSomethingToLoad` to register things which need to happen before the view can be loaded.\n\nAnd that's it. If any async tasks are registered with these functions, the view shows a progress bar until all registered tasks have finished successfully and then calls `onLoaded` which rerenders the page, and `render` then shows the full page instead of a progress bar. This system also manages the progress bar and provides messages and retry buttons if any of the network tasks fails.\n\nThe [LadderView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/ladder_view.coffee) and [LadderTabView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/ladder/ladder_tab.coffee) demonstrate how to use this system for a pretty complex use-case. The LadderTabView in particular shows how `addSomethingToLoad` and `somethingLoaded` are used to handle tracking async requests that aren't either a Model, Collection, or jqxhr, and how to combine several resources into a single Model-like object (LeaderboardData).\n\nNow we should go through all the views using startsLoading and migrate them to this system. Most views just grab a Model or Collection from the database so the process is pretty straightforward: remove the startsLoading flag and register the resource and test. Others will be more complicated, like how do we set it up for views that don't just load resources at the beginning (like [SearchView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/kinds/SearchView.coffee)]) or for ones which use the [LevelLoader](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/LevelLoader.coffee) and [SuperModel](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/SuperModel.coffee). The existing system might need to be extended a little to fit these cases.\n\nA few notes on arguments in the registration function parameters:\n- **name** is an i18n string reference. If you're loading a resource, make sure it's included in [en.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/en.coffee) under the `resources` section.\n- **value** is how much value to give a resource for the progress bar. When the resource loads, a value / totalValue segment of the progress bar is filled. I haven't tested it, but this should mean one with value 0 is essentially ignored by the system.\n- **retryFunc** is a string, the name of the function that should be run if the user chooses to retry a failed request.\n Nice refactoring!\n\nFor 1., when I tested it out, Backbone gives the jqxhr as the second argument in the callback, and the resource as the first argument. So you don't need to create a new function in the middle, you can just have it as it was, like this:\n\n`@listenTo modelOrCollection, 'error', @onResourceLoadFailed`\n\nAnd when onResourceLoadFailed, the resource and the jqxhr will be passed in properly.\n\nI'm ambivalent about having fetch in addResourceToLoad. My initial setup was to leave it to whatever outside logic to call it, since you might want to pass in special options to fetch or have access to the jqxhr for other reasons, but there are plenty of times you'd want fetch called as a matter of convenience. I lean more toward the former though, so that's how I set it up.\n\nFor 2., that's a good question. It's not really safe, because if you register things to load in the wrong order, you might inadvertently trigger onLoaded. And maybe you'll fetch a resource again later on, or sync it. I'm not sure I understand your last sentence, but I think you're saying you're concerned render might be called after an error is inserted, thereby removing it? I don't think that should happen, but it's true the error's visibility is not particularly secure. We could put them somewhere else more permanent, like in some fixed position over the page or in the nav. What would your suggestion be? Or am I misunderstanding?\n Yeah, render is called as a matter of course when the view loads or you run insertSubView. So $el is most likely instantiated by that point... but we could make it a bit safer by putting a ? in there.\n Done. New branch created: feature/loading-views\n\nThanks for digging into this! What's your plan for doing the editor views? I'm not sure what's the best way to handle LevelLoader and SuperModel. You've definitely tackling the biggest part of this project.\n Here are some ideas off the top of my head:\n- Make the SuperModel and/or LevelLoader act like resources and register them like resources. See the LeaderboardData class in ladder_tab.coffee. It has fetch, and it triggers error and sync events like a Model or Collection. Those are all you need. If you go this route, it might be good to set up a way for a 'resource' object to update its progress. Otherwise there'll be a big jump in the progress bar once everything is ready to go.\n- Give the SuperModel and/or LevelLoader this new resource management object and have them register resources and such as they go along. This would be the simplest solution to do, and would get the behavior we want the fastest, but it would further entangle things.\n- Give the SuperModel all the resource loading responsibility instead of having it be a separate object. I thought about doing this originally but a big chunk of the logic is directly related to the view, adding errors and handling button clicks and updating the progress bar, so it seemed more appropriate as part of the View logic. But if you're taking out the loading logic anyway, it doesn't make sense to have the SuperModel and this other new class divide the responsibility of loading and reloading and progress tracking.\n\nWhat do you think?\n Okay. For events, I recommend using Backbone events rather than Backbone.Mediator events, that will help make sure the right view gets the right loader updates.\n @sderickson have we solidified this new loading system enough to where we can make a hit list of remaining views that need refactoring to use it?\n  Hi @PhilVargas, thanks for taking a crack at this one, and welcome to the CodeCombat project! I like the style of your change, but I think that the issue #775 might be mistaken, since the code that you're fixing seems to already have been fixed once.\n\n@sderickson did you perhaps have an old multiplayer level saved to local storage or your user object that was there from before the check to see that the level type wasn't `\"ladder\"` or `\"ladder-tutorial\"`? Or is there a bug in that code?\n\nIf we merge #779 in, we'll have to go through and set `type` to `\"campaign\"` on all the levels that we want to save. I have done this for everything in the beginner campaign, but not the extra levels yet.\n @nwinter I wasn't the one who experienced it. I was creating the issue based on this forum post:\n\nhttp://discourse.codecombat.com/t/after-playing-multiplayer-i-cant-play-single-player/618/2\n Looks like the issue is solved. @PhilVargas, if you are looking for another issue to get started with, #736 might be a good one. The local dev environment setup instructions are [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment). It should be pretty doable to get it working, but [let us know](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa) if you run into any troubles with the setup.\n  Hi @Vindurrin, thanks for the translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  Hi Digot, thanks for the translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n Great, thanks!\n  ![screen shot 2014-04-03 at 11 27 07 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/204723/2607475/adbd8840-bb5d-11e3-9725-9b629d352056.png)\n\nReally, we need a better solution for making sure the nav bar never overflows. It has a tendency to do this.\n Template: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/base.jade#L26-L56\n\nStyling can go anywhere in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/base.sass\n The other problem is that the rest of the nav items can all vary in width depending on what language it's in and whether the user is an admin.\n Admin button could certainly be pushed to the footer; that's a great idea. After doing that, you could test in all the other languages and see if we can solve the problem with limiting the name button or lowering the font size or something. We don't want to expand the margins.\n You can move the button from the header in base.jade to the footer in base.jade.\n Try restarting brunch after you change base.jade (or editing home.jade)\u2013it doesn't update the included version in home.jade when you change base.jade.\n Most languages have translated it just as \"Admin\". The `data-i18n=\"nav.admin\"` part is the part that localizes it.\n @therealbond I don't know, but if you submit a pull request, we can see all the changes and figure out what might be going on.\n @therealbond Thanks, I pulled that in, and then did a few other changes, so now the longest name can't overflow the top bar with the longest languages (ja, sv, vi).\n  Occasional resyncs of the local database with the live database are necessary, as the local database doesn't auto-update. The dump is updated every five minutes.\n  Thanks @dkundel, great quotes.\n\nMaybe we should start having just me run `scripts/copy-i18n-tags` from now on, so I can do it at the same time as I update all locales, since otherwise we end up getting a bunch of conflicts.\n  Those units are 'terrified'. It's one of Tharin's special abilities to fear enemies and scatter them for a few seconds. That purple icon above them indicates when they're feared.\n  Thanks @swapkh91! If you liked #53, then perhaps you'll also dig #710?\n  \u0414\u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u044f\u043a\u0443\u044e!\n  Wow @tmrdja, this is great! Perfect fix for #176.\n\nCan I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  Awesome\u2013this looks really good. We can use this all over the place, I think!\n\nThe positioning was kind of subtle on my screen, so we'll have to see if anyone still gets confused, and if they do, make it more in their face.\n  Thanks for this @dkundel! Will merge in once the CI build completes :smile:\n Lol I'll fix it\nupdate: you'll fix it xD\n Thanks! :+1: \n  Hi @dpen2000, good catch! Thanks for the contribution :+1: \n  @Darredevil I think this might have been because the Effect System was not present in the level; we've added it since. Have another try at adding it.\n  Good eye, thanks!\n  Thanks for the heads up; sorry it took so long to figure out. She was missing her `idle` action. I've added it now, so she should be good to go (apart from not having any sounds recorded yet).\n  Yeeeehaaaaw!\n  Nice work, @Bia41!\n  Often people will not be able to get magic to work with the `magic.Casts` Component, because the `Magic` System isn't included by default, so magic doesn't work until you add it. We don't want to add every System to every Level by default, since that's an extra database load you might not need, but it would be great if we had a way of warning when Components are added that need a particular System that's not there.\n You can know when a Component depends on a System because the Component will have the lower-case name of that System in its `system` property. Examples: the `magic.Casts` Component has `system: 'magic', name: 'Casts'`, and it depends on the `Magic` System. `ai.FindsPaths` depends on the `AI` System.\n  Great! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks, and welcome to CodeCombat!\n  From [SpedsT on the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/login-in-problem/593):\n\n```\nSometimes, when you access the front page of codecombat.com the Google+ \"log in\" button won't work (It shows the \"Connecting\" pop-up window and then closes without actually logging in )\nI'm using Google Chrome 33.0.1750.154 m. I haven't tried any other browsers.\n```\n\nNo JavaScript errors were detected.\n  Wow, epic! I'll wait for @sderickson to review it more thoroughly, but looks pretty good to me. Now that we are running off your Validated Backbone Mediator fork, how about publishing it as a Bower component so that we can take it out of `vendor/scripts` entirely?\n Yep, this is at the top of my list! I did a cursory look and it all looks great. If not today, I'll take a deeper look tomorrow and we can go from there. Well done!\n Ran it, looks good. The only tweaks I'd do is:\n- in the mediator code, combine the error and debug logs so that each logic block logs a single line\n- also in the mediator code, emit a one-time warning when a channel without any schema comes through, so it's easy to see when something needs to be added to the list.\n- in initialize.coffee, use require.list() to find all modules in ./schemas/subscriptions and ./schemas/definitions and add them dynamically. That way any schemas added in those folders will automagically be incorporated.\n- In [this wiki page](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Events%2C-subscriptions%2C-shortcuts) or a new one, add some notes on how this works for archmages coming in. Or hold off if you think there are still sizable changes coming soon, and anything that goes into the wiki would become obsolete pretty quickly.\n\nI'll pull this whenever. I could pull it now and we can add more schemas and stubs later, or if you've got more to add first I can wait. Whenever we have a sizable number of stubs to do merged in, I'll send an email out to the archmages to dig in. If we can have some sort of grep-able flag in the code next to each schema stub, that'd be a handy way for everyone to find ones to do and see how many are left. Something like `# TODO schema stub`.\n @rubenvereecken This good to go to merge in and let the archmages know there are all these stubs to fill in, or do you have anything remaining to do?\n  Fixed in latest version of `existence.Spawns` Component (not using spawn pooling for collectable Thangs).\n  In CocoSprite, we sometimes draw a shadow Mark, but sometimes the Thang has a lower alpha value. We should draw the shadow at the alpha level of the Thang, or not draw it all if it is 0 (invisible).\n\nHere's an example referencing the Thang alpha value:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee#L279-L284\n\nHere's where the shadow is created: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee#L470\n\nIt's updated here: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee#L678-L683\n\nIf you have the latest DB, then [this level](localhost:3000/play/level/resource-gathering-multiplayer) is a good one to test on. The middle Coin Generator Wizard should be invisible, but the square shadow is still there in the middle of the map.\n  Great work @smasher816, thanks! :+1: \n  Thanks @smasher816! This should help a lot of Archmages get set up.\n  Thanks @herby!\n  Ah, nice! I think authors would be a good idea, like:\n\n```\nIf debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. - Edsger W.

Thanks!\n  We figured out that it was a conflict between ai.AutoTargetNearest and programmable.Plans.\n\nA lot of very-hard-to-debug problems happen when you start doing things like using ai.AutoTargetsNearest and programming.Programmable, or using programmable.Plans when your programmableMethod is chooseAction, or vice versa.\n\nPerhaps we should set up a list of anti-dependencies in the Components? It wouldn't catch using the wrong programmbleMethod, but it could at least let you know that AI Components and Programmable Components often don't mix. (You still have to be able to mix them, since you might not be programming chooseAction, but if it let you know, it would be helpful.)\n\nOr maybe some sort of runtime warning in the Components themselves would work better.\n  @Darredevil Can you give this another try? We've just updated CodeCombat with four months' worth of Treema fixes.\n Just tested and I see that the fix for this did get merged in, so I'm guessing we're good to go here now.\n  I wanted to fix the scrub reset to beginning in the \u201cHumans Didn\u2019t Win\u201d and \u201cOgres Didn\u2019t Win\u201d scripts:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-27 13 52 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2543385/c92d6152-b5f1-11e3-9c84-7807f96465bf.png)\n\nBut the \"Not After\" refers to whether it ever fires, not whether it just fired again for this session, right? @sderickson is there a way I can get multiplayer sessions to reset the scrub to the beginning each time the session is loaded?\n Okay, maybe I'll just hack it. I was having problems because there are three different script chains that might start when you start the level, two of which repeat on the session, and I didn't know how to get each of them to do their own thing with the playback.\n  When we are trying to point out something in the interface with a script, the \"DOM Highlight\" script triggers make a bouncing red arrow point at the thing they're supposed to click on. Sometimes they _still_ don't see it. If it made a nice bouncing noise whenever it bounced, then it would help a bit more to point out these things.\n\nWe should come up with a nice bouncing noise (I can add it to the live DB), and then also add a line that will time the sounds with the bounces. Here's how to play a sound (assuming 'dom-highlight-bounce' is the name of a sound file uploaded to the Interface sounds):\n\n``` coffee\nBackbone.Mediator.publish 'play-sound', trigger: 'dom-highlight-bounce', volume: 0.75\n```\n\nDOM Highlighting [is triggered here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level_view.coffee#L310).\n The first one might do. I've uploaded it for the sound trigger `'dom_highlight'`, so that should be ready to incorporate into the level view.\n  Saw this after [some report on the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/cant-use-debug-feature/559/3). If you use the time-travel debugger to step backward, you can get into inconsistent `.executed` and `.executing` gutter decoration states based on [bad assumptions in `highlightCurrentLine`](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee#L479-L483) (which should be refactored and moved to SpellDebugView, probably). Code was originally added by @dkundel in #523 to avoid highlight flickering from my obscenely unperformant version.\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-27 13 19 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2542937/4693df4a-b5ed-11e3-8910-2fa3fcd972e3.png)\n  To give something slightly interesting to look at while the level is loading, Scott and I started [adding some tips in the level loading template](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/level/level_loading.jade#L11-L27). Would be good to have a lot more: either things that can helpfully point out how to use CodeCombat or useful programming gems, or just random funny stuff (which should go in the .rare category). If you add tips, also add them to the [English locale file](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/en.coffee#L242).\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-27 13 01 56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2542865/676e2528-b5ec-11e3-876d-7e1443f432bb.png)\n What do you have in mind?\n The tips have to be independent of any particular level, since you might not build ogres in the level that is loading. Also, if you want to chat, please use the HipChat, since otherwise a lot of people will get emails when you comment on GitHub issues like this.\n Would be happy to merge in pull requests for (some) of those, but sounds kind of long tail.\n  Could also be related to the `this.built` array always showing the final value instead of the current one? Something weird in the spell palette, anyway.\n  Thanks @gintau!\n  Oftentimes we want to chat with a user who is on the site. We have chat built into each level session so that synchronous multiplayer has chat, and it uses Firebase to sync it\u2013great. We should expand that to allow other chat sessions to persist across the site, and also to let friends talk with each other. See [app/views/play/level/level_chat_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/level_chat_view.coffee), which uses [app/lib/Bus.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/Bus.coffee) to manage messages between players.\n\n@sderickson do you have in your head a few more details about how this would be done? I know we originally designed the Bus system for this use case.\n  I added `simulatedBy` and `simulatedFor` counts to the User object so people could see how much they are simulating, but it'd be much more motivating to simulate if I could also compare myself to who else has simulated lots of games, and to potentially publicly get points for it. Plus, more prominently displaying ratios will help for when ratios actually help control how many of your games get played.\n\nWe should add a leaderboard sorted based on `simulatedBy` to showcase the top simulators. It could live in the Simulate tab on ladder matches for now, but it could also live somewhere else, as it is not unique to any particular level.\n\nI think we just add a route for fetching the top simulators, and then look at how the LadderTabView displays its table and shows the top 10 plus the 10 around you, in terms of simulation performance. It should also show how many games you have taken up in another column, potentially also with the computed ratio (like people do with BitTorrent ratios to encourage seeding).\n @dpen2000 how's it going? Let me know if you still have time for this or want any pointers. Would love to see who else is simulating.\n  Is this good to merge in? Thanks for the translations! :+1: \n I didn't merge in the parts you pointed out as wrong, just the other parts.\n  Can you share the code you're using, maybe with a pastebin?\n Hmm, yeah, I'm seeing the same thing. You don't have very many losses, do you? ;)\n\nAre the wins close matches, or is it not even close? Are the enemies that you're beating showing code errors or otherwise not moving?\n\nAlso, do the match results play the same way in Firefox and Chrome?\n My remaining hypothesis is that something in your code is causing certain Simulators to throw Programmable errors and nullify your code, whereas other ones let your code play as it should, leading you to win easily. If it were something like, Firefox mis-simulates your code and Chrome doesn't, then that would be potentially reproducible by playing the matches in Firefox.\n Hmm, I just tried that, though, and it didn't seem to be the case. Gah, this is hard stuff to debug. Maybe we need to take the next step and start getting multiple clients simulating each game and making sure they agree, like in Bitcoin.\n @tedsanders we've made a few fixes that might be related (not sure). Can you let me know if you continue to see the bug?\n Pretty much all of these bugs are fixed. Closing.\n  Thanks @pedrofgsrj!\n  I like your approach\u2013seems to work well. I cleaned it up a bit in the merge. Thanks for taking care of that!\n  Hi @jayant1992, thanks for pointing this out! What is your username in the game?\n Thanks for letting me know @jayant1992. Is the dip still in the graph, or was it just a glitch in the graph generation?\n Did you resubmit your game at all? The only reason I can think of for your score dropping to 1000 each time would be resubmission, which resets your score.\n Assuming game was just resubmitted. Comment again and I'll reopen if this was not the case.\n  Duplicate of #744.\n  The issue here is that all collision detection is done in 2D, whereas the jumping affects the z-dimension just for visual effect. We might want to add some sort of hack such that Thangs don't collide if the z-indices are too far apart, which is similar as the needed fix figure out with Box2D collision filtering as in #52. But we do Thang collection with a very simple distance check, so we could include the z-distance there... okay, actually I just implemented it. You'll have to make sure the Thang jumps high enough, and its collectRange is low enough, such that it can actually jump over the Thangs you don't want it to collect.\n\n`jumpTo` not necessarily getting to a target is intended; the Thang's `maxSpeed`, its `jumpHeight`, and the World's gravity configure how far a Thang can jump.\n  Great work @1c7! Thanks for the translations :+1: \n  Ah, perfect. Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  @adi2412 Have you seen #540? I think the general problem of scrollbars is going to be harder to solve than can be done with CSS alone.\n The SpectateLevelView should only get to 1920px wide, and then the level loading view's wings should persist on the outside of those:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-29 13 04 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2559476/52fb556a-b77d-11e3-8954-a780207d0df8.png)\n Maybe? I fiddled with this for a while when I first made it. The only real answer would be to try it and make sure that everything still works, which is disappointing to hear, since you have to check multiple screen widths, multiple screen aspect ratios, both /play/level and /play/spectate, and loaded vs. loading.\n Nah, we want that one to be as wide as possible, since there's so much UI to show.\n\nDid you note also that we do need the scroll bars to show up when actually using them to scroll as per #540?\n FF, IE, Windows, etc. The only time the scrollbars work nicely now is when on Mac with no mouse plugged in (which is just how I always roll, so I never noticed how grody they were).\n Nice work\u2013getting close! I notice that past 1920px wide, the spectate view wings zoom all the way out instead of fitting to the sides:\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-02 15 21 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2597506/8dc0e3b4-bab5-11e3-9dcb-edf458f336c9.png)\n\nShould look like:\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-02 15 22 54](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2597514/9df47a98-bab5-11e3-8ac7-9a0b829aa9a3.png)\n\nAlso, can you put antiscroll.scss in vendor instead of app?\n\nI'm not the best to test things out because my laptop (with no mouse) is the one where everything was previously looking good, but once we get it merged in, we can have everyone else look more closely for problems. Thanks!\n @sidtrey these emails are coming because you are \"watching\" the project on GitHub. You can go to GitHub and \"unwatch\" it at the top: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat\n Cool, thanks for updating that. Merged in. I've tested it out, but without a mouse\u2013would be nice if someone with a mouse / not on Mac can take a look and see how it's going.\n\nAlso, I guess I'm a bit confused as to which CSS is coming straight from Nanoscroller and which is custom to our site. Ideally, the stuff that's custom to our site would be in .sass in `app/styles` and the stuff that's default to Nanoscroller could come in via bower, so we don't have to include the Nanoscroller JS or CSS in our repo itself. What do you think\u2013could you split those up, @adi2412?\n\nWe could also move the Nanoscroller init from `app/assets/main.html` and put it in `app/Application.coffee`, or maybe in RootViewController.\n  I added a couple more tweaks in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/b0b37aa9d83c63bf53a1d8665eed379da2bff82c and I think it's pretty good now. Thanks @Shrihari!\n  Reported by user Xoanweb on HipChat. To reproduce, view Dungeon Arena in full screen mode on Safari. You are unable to type the vast majority of characters, with a notable exception being ';' and '/'.\n  Oh! Thanks for figuring that out.\n  Good work everyone!\n  Whenever you're hovering over or interacting with the playback scrubber, a little tooltip should appear above it showing the current and max time, like `36 / 90s`. This would be a better way of figuring out what time various things happen than trying to hover over `this.now` in the spell palette (when it's even available).\n Cool! I was thinking of just using http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips for it.\n  Currently we use Google Image Charts to create a graph of score history over previous ladder matches. It was quick, and we could easily re-use the same graph in the ladder emails:\n\n![](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?chs=450x125&cht=lxy&chco=3f44bf&chtt=Score%3A+2552&chts=3f44bf,16,r&chf=a,s,000000FF&chls=2&chm=o,3f44bf,0,4&chd=t:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99|21,23,28,31,34,37,42,25,15,7,0,7,7,8,9,10,12,14,17,20,23,27,31,35,40,45,48,53,58,62,66,56,54,61,54,47,43,41,45,43,7,8,9,10,14,17,21,27,31,39,46,52,57,51,57,64,70,76,81,85,89,88,93,97,91,95,100,93,86,91,85,90,84,89,84,88,84,89,84,88,86,82,86,90,90,94,91,94,91,89,90,88,86,84,82,80,78,76,74,73&chxt=y&chxr=0,848,3195)\n\nWould be great to use a better graphing library, like we'll use for #668, to make nicer graphs, maybe ones that are interactive and can show dates and particular matches on hover or can scroll back through time. For the emails, we could either stick with the current graphs (which will stop working in a year), or we could render the graphs server-side and provide the same sort of image linking.\n d3 is super powerful, but way harder to use than Highcharts. It's like a skill of its own. If someone knows it already, great. dc.js depends on d3, but looks like perhaps a higher level of abstraction; could be good, but won't be smaller. Similarly, morris.js depends on Raphael, which is large. Chart.js looks really easy to use, powerful, and small, but it doesn't have (any? much?) interactivity, so if we're fine without that, then it might be a good way to go.\n\nI've asked Highcharts if we can use it without a license, since we're open source.\n I asked HighCharts about what we could do for licensing, and they weren't flexible\u2013there's no way we can use it with any of their current licenses.\n I've converted these to use D3. Any improvements that we would like to make are much easier to implement now.\n I think the main improvement I'd like now is to add a hover to the graph that will let you see a tooltip showing 1) who the match was against, 2) when it was played, and 3) your resulting score. I briefly looked at how to do this in D3, but I don't know D3, so it doesn't look like a brief task.\n  We need a new score distribution histogram, so that when we page through the leaderboards, it can show you where you are looking (and also where your score falls). We should not use Google Image Charts for this, as they're deprecated and clunky. Highcharts, d3.js, or others would do fine. This would live on the ladder page.\n I'm planning to use D3/Crossfilter.js for the interactive histogram, and for images in email, we can use D3 and PhantomJS to render a PNG of the appropriate graph server-side, then upload it to S3 for insertion into the email. S3 is now ridiculously cheap, and I'll use a lifecycle policy to reduce data storage costs by deleting/archiving images after some determined amount of time.\n\n@rubenvereecken I'm not sure how far you are on this, but I can take care of this quickly if you've moved on or don't think you can complete this within the next few days. Let me know your progress and if I shouldn't work on this.\n This is half done. It's not interactive, but it conveys the necessary information.\n  Fixed by #677.\n  You're a translating machine! `ru` is continually the best-localized language on the site. Nice work.\n  Don't know why we didn't get that one before!\n  I just updated the ThangType to have the Exists, Physical, and Land Components, so new Indoor Floors placed will now work properly. You can either delete old ones or add the Exists (stateless=true), Physical (10x10x2, sheet), and Land Components to them.\n  Ah, this is great! Mega useful!\n  Oh, that easy!\n  A user, \"Kukluxklams\", has reported that \", during multiplayer at the beginning when it asks for your wizardly name. You can put a name in that someone already has and just keep pressing the submit button to overide the block\"\n\nI reproduced this. Indeed the modal disappears giving the illusion of success, but the name isn't actually written to the user object, either client or server side.\n  See [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/using-this-for-persistent-variables-across-multiple-chooseaction-calls/512/13) with this code:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction Spawner()\n{\n}\nSpawner.prototype.setBase = function(base){\n    this.builder = base;  \n};\nSpawner.prototype.update = function(){\n    this.builder.build('soldier');  \n};\n\nvar base = this;\nif(!this.spawner){\n    this.spawner = new Spawner();\n    this.spawner.setBase(base);\n}\nthis.spawner.update();\n```\n\nJust builds it once, but then thinks `this.spawner.update` is undefined thereafter. If I just set a new spawner every frame, it works to build a new soldier each call.\n  Thanks @3rr3s3v3n! Can you amend the pull request to remove the leading `#` from each line you translated so that they can take effect, and also [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n Why yes, you can translate any untranslated line, or update existing translations if they have mistakes.\n Wonderful! Thank you, @3rr3s3v3n.\n  I think the solution to this could be to start using the [Versioning stuff](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Versioning) on the LevelSessions. We wouldn't save a new minor version for every code change, of course, but perhaps we would for every time the player either 1) restarted the level or 2) submitted her code to the ladder. That would map nicely as long as we could still save changes to the latest minor version without creating a new version.\n\n@sderickson what do you think about using the versioning on LevelSessions?\n I think we might want to do #264 first. LevelSessions are already the majority of the database, so I wouldn't multiply that collection's size lightly.\n  Oh, that makes sense! But I think it might be really, really, really slow. _.cloneDeep can just be brutal. Can we do it another way?\n  Entire galaxies have been saved from destruction by less!\n  Nice work, @dpen2000!\n  See app/views/editor/level/home.coffee and app/templates/editor/level/table.jade. \n\nSince the creatorName isn't denormalized into the Levels or Articles, you could either denormalize it and start saving those in there, or if you want to get the creatorName dynamically, then you'll look at the permissions of the level and do something like app/views/play/ladder/my_matches_tab.coffee does with the name fetching.\n\nOr, if you just want to highlight which are yours, you could just look through the levels and find any where you have edit permissions (`me.id` is in the level's permissions), then mark those as yours, or put them at the top or something.\n  Looking good. I don't think we need to worry about the save failing here, since it's not a big deal if the autocast setting didn't get saved. Can you update the default from 1000 to 5000 in the user schema, and also remove the `# TODO` line in the cast button view and the other comment about it in the user schema?\n Thanks @dpen2000!\n  @therealbond I've merged this in but we haven't deployed it yet. Could you pull the latest code to your local dev environment and test it to see if it works better for you before we push it live?\n  After pondering this for a while, I think that we probably want to save space in those match histories, which get kind of long, instead of storing it for each match result.\n  Thanks @batista!\n  Thanks @muhammadn! Just to clarify, the ms-BA should just be ms, because that's what the browser's Accept-Language header will commonly be set to for speakers of Bahasa Malaysian?\n Great! Makes sense. I've pointed the locale.coffee file at the new ms.coffee file. Glad to finally have some more progress on that one.\n  Thanks @phanimahesh! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) real quick?\n Well, using Jade's `:markdown` filter inside the .jade file would certainly have simplified the formatting work, but now that it's done, I'm not sure there's an advantage. It does have to include the  markup for the form at the bottom.\n  @iamhj How'd this go\u2013any progress, or questions you ran into?\n  Wow, this is so complete! Nice work on finishing those Polish translations.\n  Hi @gintau\u2013looks like there's a lot of git chaos going on in the pull request. Do you think you could figure out a way to just submit the commits that actually implement the feature? That would make it easier to review and merge in.\n  Instead of [using local storage for autocastDelay in the cast button view](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/cast_button_view.coffee#L35-L36), we should [create a User property](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Coco-Models) to handle it.\n\nWe should probably do a similar thing for the [home view](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/home_view.coffee#L33-L42) and [level view](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level_view.coffee#L156-L157) for the lastLevel property.\n Autocast delay is done! If we can fix up that `lastLevel` part, too, it'll be great. Local Storage is just not a very good API.\n  It looks better than before, but I wonder if you could try two more things:\n1. Can you try moving the whole interface Component view down? The black separator bars and the right-hand column are also too high.\n2. Can you make sure that it still works when editing the Components for a Thang in the Level Editor? They share the same view, which is why the alignment was out of whack in the first place (it was designed first for that other place).\n\nSee also https://github.com/ItsLastDay/codecombat/commit/1cc3e79db98c035bba47fd46ca68fdc8aa1a7ad9 and https://github.com/ItsLastDay/codecombat/commit/62a170106303f8fc12e88e7e690b095f4acc4595 for more info from https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/610\n But now the Level Editor's version is too far down; it should be flush with the top in both cases.\n Closing in favor of https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/610.\n By the way, @saddamp\u2013can I get you to [sign the CodeCombat contributor license agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) with your GitHub username? It's easy; just affirms that you have the right to let us use code from your pull requests. Thanks!\n  Related to in-progress https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/610\n Fixed by #610.\n  Hmm, I think your fork might not be in sync. We have some i18n in the current version (which has not been deployed). I've added the space, too:\n\n``` jade\n            td.battle-cell\n              a(href=\"/play/level/#{levelID}?team=#{team.id}&opponent=#{match.sessionID}\")\n                if (match.state === 'win')\n                  span(data-i18n=\"ladder.watch_victory\") Watch your victory\n                else\n                  span(data-i18n=\"ladder.defeat_the\") Defeat the\n                  |  \n                  | #{team.otherTeam}\n```\n  Thanks @OlenaGapak!\n  Hi @yangshun, thanks for pointing this out! We've had some people on Helpscout point this out, I'll have to investigate why it happens.\n  See [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/using-this-for-persistent-variables-across-multiple-chooseaction-calls/512) for three examples of code that should work but don't. Probably has something to do with me recently mucking around in the Programmable Component and protectAPI.\n Think I've found the problem; fix in progress.\n Got it! Give it another shot now (might need a cache clear).\n  Thanks @kvasnyk!\n  Nice work, @fusspawn! Very timely, too.\n  Thanks OverProgram! Appreciate the translations. Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  @karthigb It looks like the CSS got saved in there as an HTML page. We probably also want to put these in vendor/scripts and vendor/styles instead of assets/app/lib, and then they'll automatically get compiled into the app via brunch and don't need to be individually required in index.html. See http://brunch.io/ for a bit more on how that works.\n I was messing around testing this and did something funny with git trying to squash the commits to avoid the larger files from distending the repository. Anyway, I merged this in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/f52dced0ce440b8c598db2da82ccd218575c618a but also disabled it for now, because it was causing some bugginess, like being able to scroll to the right on level pages. I also moved the initialization a bit: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/424390ae8464eaccea184244e831a53f06cf26c5\n\nPerhaps you can figure out how to use Antiscroll more selectively to eliminate the target scrollbars without interfering with the horizontal scroll there?\n\nThanks for working on this!\n  @ItsLastDay Ah, right. Could you find a way to tweak the CSS so that it works in both cases?\n Great! Thanks for taking care of that, and I dig the scrolling in the Thangs view, too. Nice.\n  Looking good, @Shrihari!\n  Ah, nicely done! Thanks for fixing that up. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? It's easy.\n  Thanks for adding these translations! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? It's easy.\n  Hmm, not sure the math is right, but it definitely looks better than it did! Thanks for hacking on that.\n\nThe initial velocity gets set across the combat.Missile and combat.Arrow [Components](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component), so some improvements there may help. The z-velocity is always negative in this scenario because the arrow tower is shooting the arrows from, I think, seven meters up, so it's always down to get to the targets.\n  Thanks @bkimminich!\n  Thanks @walkingtospace!\n  Fixed in #700.\n Ah right, not yet. We do deploys to production every day or so, but I just merged this in right after I did one.\n  I think I've fixed this\u2013can you give it another shot and let me know? Thanks!\n Another user just reported that it's still broken in FF28 on Windows, so we have more fixing to do. If anyone can see the bug on their local dev machines and wants to figure out the Flash z-indexing problem, I'd love any help!\n Good to know, @phanimahesh\u2013would you like to submit a pull request for it?\n  Nice work! Thanks for putting this together; now we just need to get all of Brazilian Facebook on here again to check it out. ;)\n  Awesome, about time we got Arabic started! Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) real quick? Thanks!\n  Cool, thanks. \u52a0\u6cb9\uff01\n Sorry for not getting back to you\u2013our email inbox is overflowing right now!\n\nDefinitely put together a quick proposal for GSoC, and swing by [our HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa) to talk more about the awesome levels you want to make!\n  Thanks @ImmortalJoker!\n  Thanks @BonnieBBS!\n  Thanks for updating that.

Thanks!\n  @sderickson or @schmatz: can you double-check this one?\n @ItsLastDay sorry about the slow review here, we want to make totally sure when reviewing code in this area, but the last few days have been crazy for us!\n  Nice work on doing this to docs.jade. There are a bunch more of these scattered throughout the templates directories, though. Would you be willing to do the same thing to the rest of them?\n Thanks for tidying all those modals up!\n  Nice work\u2013such translation stamina! We've needed some good Korean translations for a long time. Thanks!\n\nIf you are going to do more, it helps to leave the unfinished lines commented out, so that it's easy to see what is left to do and so that the English fallback keeps working (if we change things).\n  Great! Can you sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  The hacking in Brawlwood is possible because Aether's protectAPI functionality is not enabled in that level yet, since it's really slow and Brawlwood is slow enough, and I noticed a few remaining little bugs using it. You can't do the same tricks in Dungeon Arena, since Dungeon Arena is using protectAPI.\n\nUntil I figure out the last little bugs (they are really hard to track down), it'd be awesome if people would not submit clever cheating solutions to the Brawlwood leaderboard.\n Think I've fixed the protectAPI bugs, so I enabled it for Brawlwood. If you play against Quasar now, it should be a fair fight.\n  Hi @2xG, thanks for fixing those! Can you help me out a bit and do two more things?\n1. Sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) (it's easy).\n2. Can you add one more commit that uncomments the lines you have translated? You can just delete the `#` at the beginning of a line.\n\nThanks!\n  I can think of several things to do to make it really concise and flexible. I could implement them myself and you could check out what I did, or if you're interested, I could give you some ideas\u2013which would you prefer?\n You can get the info once in the CocoSprite's createMarks and pass it to each radius mark, or there could be a common function that uses a regexp to get all the radii that will be displayed, and you can use it both for determining which marks to build and for each mark, figuring out which other marks will be built.\n\nThen, once you have that, you can sort them as you say in order to determine, for each mark, what the next-smallest mark is, so that it can leave that much area hollow.\n\n``` coffeescript\n    colors =\n      voice: \"rgba(0, 145, 0, alpha)\"\n    # ...\n    @mark.graphics.beginFill color.replace('alpha', 0.4)\n```\n\ncan be done better as:\n\n``` coffeescript\n    alpha = 0.4\n    colors =\n      voice: \"rgba(0, 145, 0, #{alpha})\"\n    # ...\n```\n\nThen we need some extra default colors for unspecified properties. You could also look at `buildBounds()` to figure out how to generate random colors for if there are extra radii, but probably best to just come up with, say, four more extra colors that we can use, and then pick them based on radius order for extra range properties for which we haven't set a specific color.\n\n``` coffeescript\n    return if type is 'voice' and @sprite.thang.voiceRange > 9000\n    return if type is 'visual' and @sprite.thang.visualRange > 9000\n    return if type is 'attack' and @sprite.thang.attackRange > 9000\n```\n\nJust make this abstract:\n\n``` coffeescript\n    return if @sprite.thang[type + 'Range'] > 9000\n```\n\nBy the way, something needs improvement on the design to make it work for cases like the visual and attack ranges on Brawlwood, where it's much too prominent:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-16 11 27 27](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2431605/a8f3c15e-ad38-11e3-9a6e-2c15724c6890.png)\n\nCould try lowering the alpha and relying more on a bolder stroke (not a real stroke, but one made with another thin, hollow circle slightly larger than the other).\n  Nice work, as always!\n  The code is fine for the first commit, np. I like that and the third commit.\n\nFor the second commit, if you do this, then there'll be no way to move a floor around once it has been placed short of typing in new coordinates. The current method of selecting it in the Treema and then dragging it is lame, but at least you can do it. Got ideas for an alternative?\n  When you construct the level like that, you have an empty Backbone model which hasn't been fetched from the server, so `teamDataFromLevel` can't get any data from it. The level is already constructed in LevelView, which creates the TomeView, so we could just pass the level in there.\n\nBut I think the data might be available already\u2013look at TomeView's `generateTeamSpellMap` code. See how each spell already has a `team` property? I think that's all we'll need. We can also do it on any level, not just Brawlwood.\n `me.team`?\n  I merged just the relevant commits from this. Thanks! By the way, can you [sign our CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  What operating system are you on? This happens sometimes on Linux, which I'm guessing you're running.\n  Fixed in fc7d403785f471767641c2d20f6c8192fff31273 .\n  Investigating this, I'll keep you updated. Thanks for reporting!\n Feel free to hack on this, but IMHO this error happens so infrequently to end users it isn't worth the development time. \n  Wow, this is so much better! You and the others were so right about dragging in the editor, and you fixed two other bugs at the same time. Nice!\n  Check out [app/templates/play/modal/docs.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/level/modal/docs.jade):\n\n``` jade\n// TODO: refactor to be like other modals\n.modal-dialog\n  .modal-header\n    button(type='button', data-dismiss=\"modal\", aria-hidden=\"true\").close &times;\n    h3(data-i18n=\"play_level.guide_title\") Guide\n\n  .modal-body\n    ul.nav.nav-tabs\n      for doc in docs\n        li\n          a(data-target=\"#docs_tab_#{doc.slug}\", data-toggle=\"tab\") #{doc.name}\n    div.tab-content\n      for doc in docs\n        div.tab-pane(id=\"docs_tab_#{doc.slug}\")!= doc.html\n\n  .modal-footer\n    a(href='#', data-dismiss=\"modal\", aria-hidden=\"true\", data-i18n=\"modal.close\").btn.btn-primary Close\n```\n\nThis could be refactored to operate like [app/templates/modal/recover.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/modal/recover.jade):\n\n``` jade\nextends /templates/modal/modal_base\n\nblock modal-header-content\n  h3(data-i18n=\"recover.recover_account_title\") Recover Account\n\nblock modal-body-content\n  .form-inline\n    .form-group\n      label.control-label(for=\"recover-email\", data-i18n=\"general.email\") Email     \n      input#recover-email.input-large.form-control(name=\"email\", type=\"email\")\n\nblock modal-body-wait-content\n  h3(data-i18n=\"common.sending\") Sending...\n\nblock modal-footer\n  .modal-footer\n    button.btn.btn-primary.btn-large#recover-button(data-i18n=\"recover.send_password\") Send Recovery Password\n```\n\nSee how it extends the `modal_base` template and then we don't have to have all that extra markup? All our modals should do that, but instead maybe only half of them do.\n\nWe should hunt down all the modal templates (all of them will live somewhere in app/templates) and just make them use modal_base.\n  I just had a transcendent experience setting the mark and doing various Emacsy things. Awesome. Now we can try adding an option to change the language between JavaScript and CoffeeScript and see what else needs to be done to realize full enlightenment.\n\nNice!\n  Context for \"Revert\" and \"Revert Models\":\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-13 18 18 08](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2417121/896d0904-ab16-11e3-9259-37c475be7be4.png)\n\n\"Ladder games\" can also be thought of as \"ranked games\", \"official games\", etc.\n  Ah, nice work! I like all of these changes. Now the question will be whether we people can learn the shift+click from our tutorial scripts.\n  It often messes with the layout or looks ugly when playing the level if scrollbars appear when they're not being used. Especially if some modal or popover goes behind the bottom of the page, it then adds a vertical scrollbar, which reduces the width of the page, which makes all the content shrink and elements move around. Not great. See this disaster on Windows where the HUD, spell palette, body, and spell editor are all showing scroll bars at the same time and looking terrible:\n\n![bad_scroll_windows](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2412543/ff258c04-aad3-11e3-9a6e-fa9d89cd412d.PNG)\n\nThis works fine on OS X when just using a touchpad, because OS X hides scrollbars when not in use when using a touchpad by default, and when they are in use, the float over the content instead of taking up space. It also looks good, and we don't have to worry about what will happen to the layout when a scrollbar might appear. For the views used when playing the game, this is great. See, I just scrolled in the spell editor, so its scrollbars (and I guess the body's horizontal scrollbar) are showing, and the scrollbars in the HUD and spell palette are not, and none of them affect layout:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-13 10 17 51](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2412504/736bc796-aad3-11e3-8a8d-6c2bdd345403.png)\n\nBased on [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6863748/lion-like-scrollbar-with-jquery), I found two libraries which might be good to add and make use of on the /play page to make other platforms behave the same way: [Antiscroll](https://github.com/LearnBoost/antiscroll) and [nanoScroller.js](https://github.com/jamesflorentino/nanoScrollerJS). We should add one of these to the site (if nanoScroller, then adding it to our [bower.json](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/bower.json); if Antiscroll, then putting its files in [/vendor](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/vendor)), then hook up scrollable views where this causes problems to use it:\n Great! This is going to fix a lot of badness.\n  Wow, amazing work! Thanks for taking the time to translate so much of it at once; really appreciate you adding all of this.\n\nCan I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge it in?\n\nAlso, if you want to [add yourself as a Diplomat to the Diplomats section](https://github.com/TigroTigro/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/contribute/diplomat.jade), that'd be great!\n Awesome; glad to have you on board!\n  I went to start a new Ogre match, not having one before on my Nick02 Crazy account, and saw this:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-13 06 52 43](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2409889/ebdb559c-aab6-11e3-8e67-429ec04a3aff.png)\n\nNote that it thinks my easy opponent is the top human player, whereas my hard one is ranked 54th.\n\nThat happens sometimes. Other times, I get a easy/medium/hard spread of guys from the bottom of the ladder as expected.\n @sderickson I believe I misdiagnosed Mongo 2.5.4 bugs as low performance due to this query. Why don't you just put it back in, and then we can see if it is still a problem. If it still is, we can use the aggregation pipeline to speed it up.\n Will do. Do you still have the test query handy?\n It should be easier now that in 2.6 when you build an index on the primary in the background, it also builds on secondaries in the background. \n So we have to wait until us three have all got the latest code, then we should run a few commands\n\n```\ndb.level.sessions.update({\"totalScore\":{$exists:true},\"submitted\":false},{$unset:{totalScore:\"\"}},{multi:true})\n```\n\n```\ndb.level.sessions.update({\"totalScore\":{$exists:true},\"submitted\":{$exists:false}},{$unset:{totalScore:\"\"}},{\"multi\":true})\n```\n\nAfter this, we can then remove submitted, as the totalScore/submitted iff condition will be true.\n\nHowever, the query is fixed now, and only takes 3ms instead of around a second.\n This bug should be resolved, so I'll close it.\n  Ah, nice work! That Thang category filter button group untoggling has been long overdue. Thanks for putting this together.\n  Very good! I made it such that it doesn't fallback to 'text' if the given property isn't found, since for example we need to be able to get 'blurb' or null if there is no blurb. I also started using it everywhere in the views that we're using i18n, which ended up being many places, so this is very helpful.\n  Heroic!\n  The kind of data that [app/views/play_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play_view.coffee) uses in [its template](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play.jade) to make a levels list should instead be moved to the [Level model/schema/handler](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/levels/level_schema.coffee) instead and made editable from the Level Editor's [SettingsTabView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/settings_tab_view.coffee). [More info on adding properties to models is in the wiki](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Coco-Models). We'll want each level to have its own icon file upload reference as one of the properties.\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-13 10 50 33](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2412886/01fdce9c-aad8-11e3-8347-afb88a404ee6.png)\n\nSo of this kind of data:\n\n``` coffeescript\n    arenas = [\n      {\n        name: 'Dungeon Arena'\n        difficulty: 3\n        id: 'dungeon-arena'\n        image: '/file/db/level/526ae95c1e5cd30000000008/zone_of_danger_icon.png'\n        description: \"Play head-to-head against fellow Wizards in a dungeon melee!\"\n        levelPath: 'ladder'\n      }\n```\n\nWe might want to add the `difficulty` and `icon` properties, as well as a `publishedCategory` that tells us what category to list it in (which would default to null if unlisted and be an enum of `['beginner', 'multiplayer', 'dev', 'player-created']`, and we'll have to hook it up so that only admins can change it). We can deduce whether the `levelPath` should be `\"ladder\"` or the default `\"level\"` based on the Level's `type` (`\"campaign\"` or `\"ladder\"`).\n\nWe may want to discuss any changes we want to make to the /play levels list, in case we want to change this format. If you look at [Dungeon Arena's landing page](http://codecombat.com/play/ladder/dungeon-arena), it has a large banner image as well (which is currently just living in its description). We might want to add not just an `icon` property but also a `banner` property. @sderickson thoughts?\n\nAlthough it's a fair amount of work, it should be pretty doable to figure out all the stuff to add, and it'll be a great way to get familiar with the system for any Archmage who wants to work on it. Once it's ready, we can migrate the data over and then be able to list new levels and modify their listings without doing a full production deploy!\n So it is.\n  If you can contact him again, ask him the specifics of his setup, particularly what graphics card he has. The fact that it's spewing bits of his video memory all over the screen (the pieces of console splattered all over the canvas) make me believe it's primarily a graphics driver/hardware issue. \n\nI'm going to close this issue, but if updating his graphics drivers doesn't help, and he has a somewhat modern and commonplace card, feel free to reopen.\n  @prabh27 thanks for pointing this out! As a side note, this also manifests itself through an \"SSL error\" with Chrome. @nwinter is this a problem with the Facebook app configuration?\n Fixed. Plus the site has SSL now.\n  @prabh27 Can I get you to [sign the CodeCombat contributor license agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) with your GitHub username? It's easy; just affirms that you have the right to let us use this code. Thanks!\n  You can do phase one now. Look at the [Simulator](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/simulator/Simulator.coffee). Its inputs are the Level, which you can just load once; the goals; and the input code. You can vary the input code, run the simulation in the web worker, and then check to see if the goals were victorious.\n\nAs for running the world simulation in C++ or with GPU acceleration, that seems almost impossible given that the game engine is not only all in CoffeeScript, but is CoffeeScript that changes all the time (since the code is made of the Components and Systems in the database), and it incorporates a user's code as a first-class part of the game engine.\n\nIf you had a fast computer and a really simple level and you optimized the Simulator to re-use the web worker and not do any additional loading per simulation, then you could probably simulate each match in 200ms per core, which with four cores would take ~8 minutes to do 10,000 simulations. But that's a really, really simple level; it's just not going to be possible to get something like Brawlwood going that fast\u2013it's probably 20x as much computation to do. Dungeon Arena would work better.\n Hi @AwokeKnowing,\n\nVery interesting idea! When we were designing multiplayer, we explored the possibility of doing server-side simulation. I also brought up the C/GPU suggestion. As Nick said, it's infeasible (though of course it's not impossible.) If you'd really like to get super high throughput today and have a few thousand lying around, buy yourself a [Xeon Phi](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-phi-detail.html) or a similar MIC architecture chip and utilize all 60 or so cores with a headless browser. I'm closing this issue, but feel free to reopen if you still have interest and questions.\n  This seems fixed by #547.\n  Not fixed:\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/60497/692388/3mphf5W8eC5CnzA/save-error.png)\n  Thanks jsam, great names! I took out \"Necros\" for the male archer, since it seemed so necromantic, but other than that, they're all in.\n  For 297, an alternate phrase is \"Respectful Conventions\", and for 331, it's a technical term so it possibly can be left untranslated.\n  Glad that finally got sorted! Can you remove the comments about the messiness, now that it's working?\n\nAlso, is it possible to rename the keepFromLocations2 somehow? goal.keepAllFromLocations containing objects with keepFromLocations2.keepFromLocations2 is... confusing. Variable names ending with 2 usually counts as code smell. At the very least, adding some comments saying what's going on would help. (I'm often guilty of not doing this for my own confusing code.)\n  It looks like a couple other schema changes got undone during this one, like making script: repeats into either a boolean or 'session', adding the level type and whether it showsGuide, and the descriptions for getToLocations. Can you update this to put those changes back in? Then I can merge.\n  This one appears to have some other commits in it that might have been in the other branch. Care to submit another one that just has the Treema fix?\n Great, thanks for cleaning that up.\n  Checking it out, looks pretty good. I initially wondered if it was working because there was no loading bar when it was fetching the versions, which took a while. Can you add the loading progress bar to it the way the other modals have?\n Just went through this and tested it; noticed a few things.\n1. The loading bar still doesn't show up. Can you try manually delaying the fetch to get a sense of what it's like and find the problem?\n2. I have been looking at it for a while, but I'm still confused by the mixin approach you're taking. Can we just make a VersionsModalView that subclasses ModalView and takes a model class and get rid of the old VersionsView instead of having this SuperVersionsView thing that tries to mixin both?\n3. Some of the files have DOS line endings. How about converting those to Unix line endings?\n4. Noticed a strange bit in SuperVersionsView:\n\n``` coffeescript\n  # needs to be overwritten by child\n  id: \"\"\n  url = \"\"\n  page = \"\"\n```\n\nShould `url =` and `page =` be `url:` and `page:` instead?\n Very nice work, @rubenvereecken! It's been a long time in coming to have these views accessible. Thanks for bearing with all the nits and my confusion as to what should be done.\n  We had a chat. Basically, it sounds like the way to go will be the decentralized architecture, and we don't need high res, screensharing, textual chat (it's through Firebase), or recording.\n  That's the letterbox mode, during which playback control should be disabled (for cinematic effects). Do you think it would make more sense to show a somehow more visibly disabled play button, rather than removing it as is currently done?\n Fixed by #684.\n  Even though the sprite sheet colors preview for the [House 1 ThangType](http://codecombat.com/editor/thang/house-1) colors the roof properly throughout all animations, when you actually watch it die, it changes back to default color during the die animation. Compare the idle animation vs. the first frame of the die animation:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-09 09 38 40](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2368449/46c8e056-a7aa-11e3-94c9-c6735c46bec0.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-09 09 39 06](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2368451/4af3a170-a7aa-11e3-8f05-3a607e20efb6.png)\n The team color should make the house roof the same red in both 'idle' and 'die' animations, though, and instead it's not there during 'die'.\n  Hi @gorodsb! Nice job on these translations. Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n\nAlso, would you mind going through and uncommenting the translations which are added by removing the leading `#` from their lines? So instead of this:\n\n```\n#    saving: \"\u0417\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f...\"\n```\n\nLike this:\n\n```\n    saving: \"\u0417\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f...\"\n```\n\nYou can add another commit to this pull request.\n Thanks!\n  @npani13, danke f\u00fcr der Beitrag, aber \"Manuell\" ist die richtige Verwendung\n  Thanks @liyinkan!\n  Code should be in [app/views/play/tome/spell_palette_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_palette_view.coffee) and the related tome.coffee and spell_palette_entry_view.coffee files.\n  Good catch on those tags being mistyped!\n  Hmm, it should save the last completed level into local storage and then take you back to it if you hit \"Play\" on the home page. If you hit \"Play\" on the home page now, does it take you to the last level you were playing?\n Are you switching browsers or computers, by any chance? The localStorage solution isn't very robust. We should probably do it based on one's account, too.\n\nAlso, there's #101 for showing progress on [the levels page](http://codecombat.com/play).\n The last level completed should now be saved in the user object instead of local storage.\n  ![screenshot 2014-03-07 08 39 32](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2359396/2b8e45d6-a617-11e3-889f-30fcd5c78d80.png)\n\nI'm logged in as me.\n I haven't seen it again since we redid the loading screen, so I'll mark as closed until we chance to see it again, if we do.\n  We'll have to do something differently, yes. Curious: which level did you start playing where this felt like a big problem?\n The tradeoff is that when the spells don't autocast, people tend to stop and think too much, and we can actually measure in the analytics that they complete levels less often (for the beginner campaign). So what it is supposed to do is be smart about it and only autocast every time you finish a complete statement, not in the middle of doing it. You can [see the logic for that here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee#L358-L375). Any suggestions for improvement?\n  I guess I'll need to add more error handling to some step of the Aether process so that we can continue even when it chokes on this code. (It should be throwing some crazy error.)\n @M-r-A I think I got this one in a recent Aether update 0.1.11, which I'll deploy soon.\n Sorry about that @evindor. I've manually fixed up  your code for now by replacing the `break` with a `return`.\n Could do, but I think it would be a lot harder than fixing the root problem of allowing code recovery along with the normal flow of playing the level. There've also been proposals to add a separate view-only page that lists all the code you've written for all the levels, which would help here.\n\nI'm fixing a lot of bugs this week, so I'll try to get this one soon.\n Awesome, will be happy to help you get set up and hacking on the project! Don't worry, I've done that like a baprillion times.\n  @sderickson I can confirm that the camera isn't getting reset properly testing now with the latest code. Any thoughts on where to debug it?\n\nTharin's armor is now fully reddened.\n  User report over at [an article we had](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bored-programming-books-try-3-fun-ways-level-coding-skills/):\n\n_So how do you get into Code Combat? Went to the site, and it said \u201cLevel could not be loaded: rescue-mission\u201d. All of the links on the page said exactly the same thing, even the ones that aren\u2019t \u201cRescue Mission\u201d. I tried signing up, hoping that would help, and clicking submit after entering my e-mail and password just re-started the sign-up form. Trying to sign in with Google gave me an error. I\u2019m at a loss here. I\u2019ve got Javascript and cookies turned on in my browser. I\u2019m using the most recent Firefox, which shouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary. The only possibly odd thing is that I\u2019m running Linux. But for a coding-related activity, that shouldn\u2019t be anything unusual._\n\nI sent him the link to http://codecombat.com/play/level/rescue-mission and another user chimed in:\n\n_Thank you for providing these links. I was able to use the first one to start the introduction mission. At the point after completing the first task (killing the first ogre) I was prompted to create an account to save which I was able to do. From the main page, however, I was receiving the same errors as Mike._\n\nI'm wondering if there is a bug in either 1) the way that links/routing are being done from the front page or 2) the database (sometimes?) not serving up the levels.\n @sderickson It sounds like this stuff, and possibly #486, could be related to the recent auth changes you mentioned to me. Any theories?\n Maybe fixed this issue now, having moved the user object into main.html (renamed from index.html).\n  Wow, this sounds so great when the battle is on! I love it, even better than I had guessed it would be. Thanks for figuring that out.\n\nCan you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  Thanks, @Darredevil! I know there's a lot of text, but you don't have to do all of it\u2013every bit helps.\n  Great, thanks for tracking that down. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so we can merge it in?\n\nThanks!\n  Hi @iraladson, thanks for throwing down some names. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Then I can merge these in.\n\nThanks!\n  Nice names\u2013thanks for throwing those down!\n  Closed in favor of #479.\n  We're actually using Esprima (and falling back to Acorn) to generate the AST from JavaScript, and using the CoffeeScript Redux compiler's parser step to generate the AST from CoffeeScript. So those are the projects that you'd want to look at to see how they do it.\n\nBy the way, how popular is Roy? I'm getting the sense that it's more of an experimental language than something that we would really be psyched to add to CodeCombat or judge for the parser challenge. TypeScript sounds like a more useful addition to use. I see that [TypeScript's compiler already has an AST format](http://typescript.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/latest#src/compiler/ast.ts) that looks pretty manageable, so a parser library based on that wouldn't be too bad.\n\nClosing since it's not really an issue, as Ruben points out.\n  I think the next step for this is #99, since @deepak1556 already extended our [Aether transpiler](http://aetherjs.com) to handle CoffeeScript.\n I see we have this one already over at #71. @Gaelan it's not too far if you want to take it the next step!\n  @sderickson a good one for the new loading messaging system you're about to hook up, perhaps.\n  Seen this a couple times with names that should have been totally unique, like \"randallbennett\" and \"Nick03 Crazy\". First time it would give a 409 \"Name already in use, please choose another.\":\n\n```\nPUT /db/user/52c9d6a077fbf74d94000006 409 1118ms\n```\n\nThen I'd do it again and it would work.\n This is still happening. I open up a new incognito tab, play Rescue Mission, try to name the wizard something crazy, get a 409, press it again and it works.\n I see what you're saying. I think we don't need to delete the other user; we should just ignore the name collisions when the colliders are anonymous. We'll have to check the name for collision on signup and null it out if someone else has claimed the name in the interim. And there might be a database index reshuffle step, but we can take care of that if someone wants to add the handling for making anonymous users not claim the names.\n Made #822 to discuss this, 'cause I think the original bug is now fixed.\n  Nice work @Shrihari, this did the trick!\n  Ah, good stuff! Yeah, adding extra i18n strings so that you can get just the right translation in is typically the way to go. Thanks for your lucid attention to detail!\n  This is looking great\u2013nice. Will be good to close the first issue!\n\nCan you do two more things?\n1. Add an app/styles/not_found.sass file with a rule to center the image in the page.\n2. Sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla).\n\nThanks!\n Sweet!\n  Great work, thanks @rubenvereecken!\n  ```\n TypeError: Cannot call method 'slice' of undefined\n    at new Waypoints (eval at <anonymous> (http://localhost:3000/javascripts/app.js:14517:24), <anonymous>:12:37)\n```\n\nGotta check it out and see what could cause this; haven't used Waypoints in a while.\n If you add a Waypoints Component to a Thang, maybe without having defined any Waypoints? I haven't checked it out yet myself.\n  Maybe even not be able to make any changes, since if you're not logged in and you start changing things, it's easy to do a bunch of work and then not be able to keep it.\n  There is a versions view accessible like so: http://codecombat.com/editor/level/dungeon-arena/versions\n\nIt should probably be linked to somewhere, though. Where would you have expected to see the link? Would you mind adding it?\n I think this was fixed.\n  @Darredevil can you try on localhost now and see if #762's right click context menu cloning works? (We still need to fix alt, but just curious if there's a workaround now.)\n We now think Ubuntu is to blame based on its `alt`-handling behavior. But now that we have https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/df13bbfaa681347dbe3c835edd4bf6c8105dd708 working, it's okay.\n  Wow, excellent! Thanks for putting in all those translations. Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? \u8c22\u8c22\uff01\n  Nice work! I couldn't help but play around with the colors, and I also CoffeeScript-ified it a bit more. Thanks for figuring that stuff out.\n  Nice work, @mnmtanish! I tried this out, and it seems like it's going to be pretty cool with a few tweaks:\n1. Can you move the `moveWizard()` handling from LevelBus to WizardSprite? It makes more sense for the Wizard to respond directly.\n2. The way that the easing works on the Wizard's `beginMoveTween()`, holding the button down to move the Wizard means he restarts the tween\u2013but then he barely moves, because he's easing in and out. If we set a flag to change that to a linear tween (no easing) when we're moving in this fashion, though, it'll work.\n3. Since we probably want to move the Wizard by holding the buttons down, we should probably reduce the tween duration from 1000ms to something very short, so that he starts/stops moving responsively. (This will also help him go faster, which would be good, since he's kind of slow right now.)\n4. He should be able to move in two directions at once (left and up, down and right, etc.), so something where you pick a new target based on the current target instead of the current position would help to preserve that.\n\nWould you care to play with it a bit more to get it really awesome?\n @mnmtanish That sounds like we might be able to take care of it by making the default move time long enough to cover the initial key repeat delay. I have mine set to the minimum, but Google suggests that a default might be around 400ms? What about changing the interval from 250ms to 400ms?\n Great work on this! It's pretty fun to zoom around the map. :facepunch: :sunglasses: :facepunch: \n\nI moved the `onMoveKey()` handling to the WizardSprite itself and removed the log. We might want to play around with Camera handling in the future, since the Wizard can get ahead of the Camera now, but that's kind of cool sometime, too.\n  Ah, perfect\u2013thanks @yangshun!\n  Great work! Can you add the leading spaces back on the lines I pointed out? Then I can merge this in without errors.\n  Great catch! Two with one blow.\n  Good name. I bet you have more in you, though, eh? ;)\n\nCan you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  Thanks for the PR! :+1: \n  You have such an eye for detail! Thank you again for tracking those down.\n  Cool, that'll make things easier for python3istas.\n  I squashed these into [one commit](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/63f70f7a39f373447c945e99ca7a8cb86cbb9fb5). Thanks!\n  Now that we actually have level.type as 'ladder' when this is true, it should be no problem to go through and actually do that check for determining whether things are ladder games instead of making things up based on the level names or the existence of an opponent session.\n Well, we're still not _using_ the `type == 'ladder'` check yet, are we? I still see \"multiplayer\" if I don't have an opponent.\n Yeah, I guess we weren't :laughing: \n  Nice ones.\n  Awesome!\n  Sorry it took me so long to get to this one! Should be fixed by [c81031](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/c8103154a9c961a32ca3ed8b6aae7caa6be8f397). Thanks for the heads up.\n  Ah, this is looking really good! Can I suggest two improvements?\n1. Delete the commented-out code instead of commenting it.\n2. Add i18n tags to the error messages so that we can translate them into other languages. (You could keep the existing `'play_level.level_load_error'` tag so that those existing translations would work.)\n\nThanks!\n We haven't been using it, but I think it might work like this: http://i18next.com/pages/doc_features.html#interpolation\n Great work!\n  @schmatz fixed?\n  Duplicate of #11.\n  Can this just be that it autocasts whenever a Thang is deselected?\n We have spells cast when you deselect because it simplified some things with Firebase-based code synching, error message display, and whether the cast button knows that something has changed. Plus, we have no UI for showing that some code has changed in a unit you haven't selected. I'd rather think of ways to make it more clear that spells cast when you deselect than to make it so they don't have to.\n We watched a lot of playtests and this is a huge UX problem, so we'll just have to bite the bullet and handle having unsaved code in spell editors which aren't visible without casting it. Moving the Cast Button to be visible at the top of the Tome view above the ThangListView when there are changes will help for the UX.\n Not important now in the new hero-based regime, since the code for your hero is always up, and there's just one method.\n  This currently shows up after they press shift+space five times in a level:\n\n![screenshot 2014-02-24 11 07 27](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2249610/0ada190c-9d87-11e3-81c8-0a44a038998a.png)\n\nThis was added for #108 by @rhc2104 in #116. But how can we adjust the trigger / visibility of this such that people are 1) actually seeing it 2) at the right time 3) and not other times?\n It didn't fit in many of the cases, though. And since it doesn't go away until you use it, whereas most players will not want to use it (since they're playing the first time, not replaying), it shouldn't be too in-your-face.\n See, this doesn't always fit:\n\n![4qhautc](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2441860/3a09fe7e-ae1a-11e3-9c1b-d392153d337d.png)\n  \u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff01\u8bf7\u4f60\u7b7e[\u6211\u4eec\u7684 CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) (\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613)\u3002\n  Ah good, that was fast\u2013I just added those translation keys, it seems.

Can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? (It is easy.)\n Ah, perfect! :+1: \n  That's perfect, thanks @gediz! Thanks for doing so many translations!\n  What about doing both? Render /play but with a big .alert at the top saying which level they tried to load and that we couldn't find it.\n `LevelLoader` doesn't have a view, so it should be taken out of there. `spectate_view` is an in-progress copy of `level_view`, so don't worry about it. Probably we should notice that we can't load it in `LevelLoader` and then send us back to `/play` with the error message.\n You could try sending them back to the play view with something like this:\n\n``` coffeescript\napplication.router.navigate \"play?not_found=#{@levelID}\", {trigger: true}\n```\n\nThen in the play view, you could show the alert where it should actually be (in the template) if `@getQueryParameter 'not_found'`.\n\nMake sense?\n  Great, thanks! This will prevent some frustrations.\n  Hi OviiOne,\n\nCan you tweak the formatting on this so I can merge it in? Here's an example:\n\nOld\n\n```\n#    save: \"Save\"\n```\n\nNew\n\n```\n#    save: \"Save\": \"Guardar\"\n```\n\nYou should 1) remove the `#` to uncomment it and 2) remove the English version. So it should look like this:\n\n```\n    save: \"Guardar\"\n```\n\nAlso, can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? It's easy.\n\nThanks!\n  Nice, good fix. Thanks for catching that one!\n  Unfortunately, we can't edit the distributed code of any node_modules in this repo, so we would have to find another way to do this purely from our application's code. @schmatz what would be a better approach?\n  Thanks for taking a crack at that one. I think a better approach would be to add to the `shortcuts` property of the LevelView. See https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Events%2C-subscriptions%2C-shortcuts\n\nSo you could add it in here: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level_view.coffee#L66\n\nWhat do you think?\n  When you edit a Component's config schema or settings, it doesn't show up in the save view list. I was briefly looking around for why this might be be so, but I didn't see it.\n  Thanks, liyinkan!\n  Cool, always need more archermen.\n  Wow, great start on the Bulgarian translations\u2013thanks!\n  :+1: \n  Nice, thanks for doing that! I added the i18n tags to app/locale/en.coffee, too. Soon I'll use the script to regenerate the rest of the tags in the other languages from en.coffee.\n  Great, thanks! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  It should probably look and work the same as the back button in the level editor when you're editing a level.\n Sure\u2013can't guarantee we'll like it, but it sounds like a better design move, so I'd be curious to see what you come up with.\n  Nice!\n  I just tried to reproduce this by creating a Humongous Beard, but it seems it's working now. Also, search sort of works again, and we list every ThangType up to 200 (we currently have 139), so it should be good.\n  We could show an .alert whenever you load an editor page for a model you can't edit, either saying that you need to be logged in or that you need to fork / be an admin. (On localhost, it'd be awesome if it'd explain and link to the account settings so they could mark themselves as an admin.)\n  For simulating the world headlessly, we need to grab the ThangTypes' `original` and `name` properties, but we don't want any of the other stuff. The `getLatestVersion` handler method should allow us to specify projections in some way so that LevelLoader can skip all the graphics when loading a level for headless simulation.\n  Thanks! Can you also [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)?\n  Think I've got this one fixed.\n  Fixed by #448.\n  Can't reproduce; maybe fixed. Let me know if you still see this.\n  I think this is fixed; I don't see them too-specific minion codes in the session any longer.\n  We're running some O(m*n) algorithm performance bottlenecks where we have to compare all Thangs of one type against all Thangs of another type which may be nearby, and doing that with two arrays of Thangs isn't efficient since we're ignoring distance information. It gets even worse when we have to recalculate distances for each comparison, and when we need to include line of sight, then we're doing raycasting, and raycasting is terrifically slow. Good examples include determining whether Collectors can collect Collectables and which friends and enemies a Thang can see and hear.\n\nIt would be better to have a general quadtree implementation we could put Thangs in so that various Systems could perform faster. [Quadtrees are a form of binary space partitioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) and I'm sure many JS or even CoffeeScript implementations exist that we could adapt to our Thangs.\n Nope! Want to take a crack at it? It would actually be really amazing to have soon, as we're limited in the levels we can build by the current implementations.\n That's understandable\u2013school can take a lot of life force. If you can post any progress you do make, it'll be helpful.\n @ItsLastDay Let me know if you make any progress on the quadtrees. Are you working on it in GitHub somewhere?\n This is now a student project for http://cdl.rosedu.org/\n  Example: trying to delete a property like \"nextLevel\" from a level's settings doesn't stick, because the server doesn't realize that you've specified that it should be deleted.\n\n@sderickson can you fill in a bit more info on how to fix this one?\n  ```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./coco/scripts/devSetup/setup.py\", line 46, in <module>\n    setup.setup()\n  File \"/Users/akhilthampy/coco/scripts/devSetup/factories.py\", line 74, in setup\n    super(self.__class__, self).setup()\n  File \"/Users/akhilthampy/coco/scripts/devSetup/factories.py\", line 41, in setup\n    if \"v2.5.4\" not in mongo_version_string:\nTypeError: Type str doesn't support the buffer API\n```\n\nShould perhaps be:\n\n``` python\nif any(s in mongo_version_string for s in [\"v2.5.4\",\"v2.5.5\",\"v2.5.6\"]):\n```\n\nBut that also doesn't work, because apparently you can't do string search that way in Python 3.\n  Translated from Russian: \n\"Unable to register using G+ \nIn the error message displays html c description of the problem, cookies, and other urlami. In particular:\n\n```\nThe following error was encountered:\n\nInvalid Request\nSome aspect of the HTTP Request is invalid.

Mind signing the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? It's easy.\n  Thanks monetita!\n  diffpatch has been added as a dependency for showing changes to documents, so number 3 can be implemented no problem.\n  @adi2412 which version of mongo are you using?\n\nWe've switched to 2.5.4, and are thinking of upgrading to 2.6.0.\n Did you manually enable text search?\n Thanks for pointing this out, once 2.6 comes out and we upgrade (and make sure any deprecated text search commands are resolved), I'll take a look at this and resolve it.\n Was probably a 2.5.4 bug. Upgrading to 2.6.0-rc1 worked. Thanks for the help diagnosing and fixing this!\n  Closing now that text searching is working nicely.\n  MongoDB 2.6 RC1 was released on February 21, so it might make sense to just hold out a bit longer for that\u2013assuming that it will be easy to run 2.6 once it's available on the Travis end? \n Now that MongoDB 2.6 is out and we're running it, perhaps it's about time for plopping a DB into the Travis CI server. What do you think, @schmatz?\n TravisCI doesn't yet support MongoDB 2.6 I assume it will soon.\n @sderickson added support for this :+1: \n  Wow, that's a lot of translations! Nice work\u2013thanks for polishing that off.\n  Nice, nice! Thanks!\n  Thanks @sorsjen! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) for us?\n  I was trying to figure out why setting the `preferredLanguage` when not signed up was resulting in 403 Forbidden errors. In user_handler.coffee:\n\n``` coffeescript\n  hasAccessToDocument: (req, document) ->\n    if req.route.method in ['put', 'post', 'patch']\n      return true if req.user.isAdmin()\n      console.log \"user id is\", req.user._id, \"and doc id is\", document._id\n      console.log \"user is\", req.user\n      console.log \"doc is \", document\n      return req.user._id.equals(document._id)  # <-- not equal, so 403s\n    return true\n```\n\nI get:\n\n```\nuser id is 52ec41f03607160000000008 and doc id is 52ec41f03607160000000005\nuser is { testGroupNumber: 10,\n  _id: 52ec41f03607160000000008,\n  __v: 0,\n  preferredLanguage: 'en-US',\n  anonymous: true,\n  permissions: [],\n  emailSubscriptions: [ 'announcement' ],\n  music: true,\n  name: '',\n  dateCreated: Fri Jan 31 2014 16:38:08 GMT-0800 (PST) }\ndoc is  { testGroupNumber: 134,\n  _id: 52ec41f03607160000000005,\n  __v: 0,\n  preferredLanguage: 'en-US',\n  anonymous: true,\n  permissions: [],\n  emailSubscriptions: [ 'announcement' ],\n  music: true,\n  name: '',\n  dateCreated: Fri Jan 31 2014 16:38:08 GMT-0800 (PST) }\n```\n\nSo basically two Users have been created at the same time, and I'm trying to write my `preferredLanguage` to one of them, but the server thinks I'm the other.\n\n@sderickson thoughts on fixing this and/or refactoring the User creation process? Experience shows that I end up introducing more bugs than I fix every time I try to figure out when and where Users can be created so that I can add properties like `preferredLanguage` and `testGroupNumber`.\n  @sderickson Whenever clicking into the Surface, we throw this error:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'offsetTop' of null   easeljs-NEXT.combined.js:7239\np._getElementRect   easeljs-NEXT.combined.js:7239\np._updatePointerPosition   easeljs-NEXT.combined.js:7325\np._handlePointerDown   easeljs-NEXT.combined.js:7415\np._handleMouseDown   easeljs-NEXT.combined.js:7403\nls.mousedown.f   easeljs-NEXT.combined.js:7200\n```\n\nIt doesn't seem to affect much, but it got me to wondering if we shouldn't update our CreateJS. Presumably there have been many improvements.\n  See [the announcement](http://blog.createjs.com/webgl-support-easeljs/) and [the technical discussion](http://blog.createjs.com/webgl-easeljs-a-technical-intro/) for some more info. Basically, we are using a bunch of stuff that can't be done in the WebGL renderer, but what we could do is split our content up into two stages, one using the superfast WebGL rendering, the other using the normal stage for extra features, and have them overlaid on top of each other.\n\nSince we're not currently having rendering speed performance issues (most performance problems are due to the spell editor / World simulation), this is more a \"wouldn't it be cool\" sort of thing.\n You can just update your proposal to include a bit of details on how you would also be interested in doing this idea.\n http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014 -- April 21\n @therealbond Instead of changing Stage to SpriteStage, we probably need to add another SpriteStage to work alongside Stage, so that we can add the children to the SpriteStage if supported, and to the normal Stage instead. Does that make sense?\n See [here](http://blog.createjs.com/webgl-easeljs-a-technical-intro/):\n\n_Finally, it\u2019s easy to layer a Stage canvas with a SpriteStage canvas, and pass through mouse/touch interactions using the upgraded Stage.nextStage API. Even interactions like mouseover/out will work correctly between stages._\n\n``` javascript\n// pass mouse events through to the next stage.\nmyTopStage.nextStage = myBottomStage;\n// chain multiple stages together:\nmyBottomStage.nextStage = yetAnotherStage;\n```\n\n_You can have multiple stages, all chained together in this manner. The canvases can be different sizes, and even be updated independently, so you could have an ultra fast, full screen game engine rendering to WebGL at 60fps, with a beautiful vector UI overlay rendering into a half height canvas at 20fps._\n\nThey then link to an example using two stages. I think that's the approach we would take.\n  This is what [our contributor lists](http://codecombat.com/contribute/archmage) look like:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-31 15 07 12](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2055869/7c40e62a-8acc-11e3-93d4-2e7414b8d85d.png)\n\nIsn't that the most boring thing ever? We need to get some sweet CodeCombat profile pictures in there, and maybe some more info than just the name. Keeping them a bit more up-to-date would be good, too.\n\n@sderickson Is there a link structure to grab a CodeCombat player's Gravatar? If so, we could just gather CodeCombat User IDs to help populate the pictures, and maybe have a fallback to the default Wizard portrait.\n I've statically referenced some archmage avatars for now, but links to User profile pictures is still needd.\n I think that keeping the contributors list hardcoded is good, because we don't know who would be in the Diplomat vs. Archmage section, and some Archmages are doing things in Aether or Treema or the Components/Systems. Plus, we want this for every /contribute category, too. This way, we can highlight contributors in a more consistent fashion.\n\nBut, it would be better if the data format were just the GitHub username and CodeCombat user ID, and we could then pull their profile picture dynamically from Gravatar instead of hosting the Archmage pictures statically in our GitHub. We could then move the existing Archmage pictures over to the users' Gravatars.\n\nA better design and layout would be very welcome!\n In 08616de I refactored most of this to operate off of contributor entries like this:\n\n``` coffeescript\n  contributors: [\n    {id: \"52bfc3ecb7ec628868001297\", name: \"Tom Steinbrecher\", github: \"TomSteinbrecher\"}\n    {id: \"5272806093680c5817033f73\", name: \"S\u00e9bastien Moratinos\", github: \"smoratinos\"}\n    # ...\n  ]\n```\n\nThis then pulls in their user photo, falling back to their Gravatar photo, falling back to the default photo for the contribute class they're in. It also links to their GitHub commits to CodeCombat if we add the `github` field.\n\nUnfortunately, we haven't been collecting CodeCombat user IDs for the contributors (if you are a contributor, you can go to [http://codecombat.com/auth/whoami](http://codecombat.com/auth/whoami) and get the `_id` value), so I can't rip out the static avatar images just yet. Also, we sorely need to update the lists to add a lot more contributors.\n\n@yangshun if you have design suggestions / mockups / implementation of a better design than this, they'd be very welcome:\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-12 14 57 53](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2688225/8a2ceae2-c28d-11e3-85c2-1497114e4bb8.png)\n\nCurrent design is here: http://codecombat.com/contribute/archmage\n  Right now we have detailed versions of each character class's description text at [/contribute/<class>](http://codecombat.com/contribute/archmage), but we also have the same detailed versions listed on the [main /contribute page](http://codecombat.com/contribute#archmage). We should trim down the /contribute page list to just the highlights for easy skimming while keeping the extra info in the detailed links. Something more compact like this:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-31 15 05 32](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2055859/43180f2c-8acc-11e3-8f22-0f6ba9a90466.png)\n\nAnyone cutting down these templates would want to [generate new i18n tags](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/23) for the more-concise class description blurbs.\n  Great, thanks @HiroP0!\n  This is to make it easy to see how far various ranges extend, like attack ranges, vision ranges, hearing ranges, etc.\n- Create new Marks: new SimpleMark style where it's just a colored ellipse Shape\n- Try a light fill with dark stroke\n- Start simple: no toggle at first, global toggle later, individual toggle only if needed\n- Which radii visible will be configured kind of like HUD properties\n- Play with sayRange vs. hearingRange to see which we like and if we could just do one possibly\n [Mark.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/Mark.coffee) and [CocoSprite.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee). In CocoSprite, try checking for `.*Range` in `@thang.hudProperties` (like `\"attackRange\"`, `\"visualRange\"`) and draw a range radius mark for each one. Once we see the basics of how they look and decide whether we want to show more than one at once, we'll figure out better when to show each and how to disambiguate them.\n @Shrihari added this in #564 and #607, and it turns out to be really useful, but sometimes the radii get overwhelming, so I think the last steps needed will be 1) tone down the fill and add the stroke, and 2) UX test to see if people actually get it and it solves the problems.\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-16 11 27 27](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2431605/a8f3c15e-ad38-11e3-9a6e-2c15724c6890.png)\n\nCould try lowering the alpha and relying more on a bolder stroke (not a real stroke, but one made with another thin, hollow circle slightly larger than the other).\n @Shrihari have any time to try out the stroke/fill tweaks, or should I take a crack at it?\n  I could build this for you, or I could detail the steps needed to make such a Component (it would be pretty easy) if you (or anyone else) is interested in getting practice on how to make Components. Thoughts?\n Okay, so first, check out [the Component documentation](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component) if you haven't already. That's an overview of how creating and editing Components works.\n\nFor the random position Component, how about calling it `movement.Teleports`? Then you could add a `teleportBounds` property to the config schema, or even better, an array of them (so you could get really fine-grained with where the teleportation can happen). Each rectangle could have a schema like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"additionalProperties\": false,\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"x\": {\n        \"title\": \"x\",\n        \"description\": \"The x coordinate.\",\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"default\": 15\n      },\n      \"y\": {\n        \"title\": \"y\",\n        \"description\": \"The y coordinate.\",\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"default\": 20\n      }\n    },\n    \"title\": \"Point\",\n    \"description\": \"An {x, y} coordinate point.\",\n    \"format\": \"point2d\",\n    \"required\": [\n      \"x\",\n      \"y\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"title\": \"Boundary\",\n  \"maxItems\": 2,\n  \"minItems\": 2,\n  \"default\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": 0,\n      \"y\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"x\": 46,\n      \"y\": 39\n    }\n  ],\n  \"format\": \"bounds\"\n}\n```\n\nThat'll let people use the existing \"bounds\" node to easily configure these rectangles. Then in the Component, you can define a `teleport()` method that picks a random location from within one of the boundary rectangles, sets `@pos` to the location, and sets `hasMoved` to `true`.\n\nThe last step would be to call `thang.teleport()` once in the `attach()` method to randomize the spawn point, but now you've also added a generic `teleport()` method that can be used in many other scenarios. Later it could be extended to take arguments, maybe take time and count as a Thang Action, be range-limited, etc.\n\nThen you could attach the Component to some Thangs, configure the bounds, and check it out. If it works, find me in the HipChat and I'll publish it to the live version.\n I originally started thinking about the `RandomizesLocation` Component, but then I realized that it should naturally extend into the teleportation. Yup, further additions ilike adding `teleportXY()` would be good, too, but aren't necessary in a first iteration.\n\nThe `TeleportsOthers` Component would be cool. That one would definitely need to have a `teleport` action. Scott is working on adding spells for the spellcasters, so it'll be interesting to look at how that ends up working out as far as how the magic system is implemented. One thing you could do is instead of having a `movement.ResistsTeleportation` to just whitelist the teleportable units with a `movement.Teleports` Component\u2013then the logic for teleporting could just stay in the `movement.Teleports` Component instead of having to be duplicated in the `TeleportsOthers`.\n No real protocol like that yet; I'd suggest just posting when you're working on something (unless you think you will complete it within a few hours), and then just working on it. If someone else wants to do it and you haven't updated in a while, they can ask if you've made any progress on it.\n Check out the way that `movement.MovesSimply` defines and uses snap points, both in the config schema and the code. That should be fairly similar to how you would do the `teleportBounds`.\n\nIf you get something working well, just visit a URL like http://localhost:3000/db/level.component/teleports and email the contents of that to nick@codecombat.com so I can get it pushed live. (Lame, I know\u2013we'll work on a better way to do component editing and publishing later.)\n @Darredevil has added in a `movement.Teleports` Component which has a `teleportsInitially` config property that can allow this kind of thing. It currently just has one `teleportBoundary` rectangle instead of an array of them, but that could be extended.\n  We need to make sure that the action is \"dead\" and that the System that is rotating them doesn't do that when it's dead. Scott already tweaked something like this, but it's a bit tricky sometimes with the `plan()` code when changing actions, so I'll have to be careful.\n Fixed; noticed they had the RotatesToTarget Component, which wasn't obeying `dead`, so I tweaked that.\n  Got it. I am deploying the fix now.\n  Hi @atlantisguru. Can I get you to [sign the CodeCombat contributor license agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) with your GitHub username?

It's easy.\n We were down at the time, but we're back up now. Got you in there. Sorry about that!\n  Ah, thanks! Can you [sign the CLA real quick](http://codecombat.com/cla)? It's easy.\n  Thanks for finding that last-good version, @zachster01! :+1: \n  Ah, got this one written up over at #45.\n  We actually have a new batch of wizards coming up, just as you say: a few male-inspired, a few female-inspired, and one or two where you can't really tell. I can't find the concept art right now, but pretty soon a glorious dawn of character customizability will be upon us. Then we can resurrect the wizard customization screen (currently disabled because of a bug with non-unique wizard names).\n\nAs far as picking pronouns, I could see that, but perhaps only when we started to use pronouns? Currently they aren't needed anywhere in the game or on the site. If we did start collecting them early, it would probably be mostly for demographics data.\n This is coming right up as we introduce the new idea of you playing as a hero and choosing your hero for each level (as opposed to being a Wizard who controls whichever units happen to be in the level on your team).\n ![screenshot 2014-10-19 12 00 00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4694272/29d328da-57c2-11e4-84c1-b17d3ce57b21.png)\n  That's no good. Can you let me know if there are any JavaScript errors you see when you try to do this? You can [check in Chrome like this](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console#opening_the_console).\n\nDo [other levels](http://codecombat.com/play) work?\n @stevei2071 I've made a fix that might help out with this. If you load up [Grab the Mushroom](http://codecombat.com/play/level/grab-the-mushroom) again, does it still have the same problem?\n The casting spells / playback is confusing sometimes, right. Separate issue. Sounds like this one is good now\u2013thank for testing that!\n We've done a few fixes and deploys sine then. @stevei2071 are you still seeing the problems? If so, a screenshot or two would be helpful.\n  I tried it out and liked it, but couldn't resist tweaking a few things with it:\n1. I made it faster, so one second after the session save is dispatched, we show it immediately.\n2. Switched from using an id to a class for `.save-status`.\n3. Need a fat arrow (`=>` instead of `->`) to access `@spellHasChanged` from within the timeout, since otherwise the `this` reference changes away from the SpellView.\n\nThanks for putting that together!\n  I think this level will remain too difficult to figure out intuitively despite our best tuning efforts until we add the range radius marks that let you easily see how far away the Thangs can see/hear/attack each other from, at which point it will become easy. So I'll close this and target #310 instead.\n Sure, but one wouldn't try to `this.say(\"something\")` to lure the ogres from the lower position instead of the upper position, because one could see that they wouldn't hear. It's kind of difficult to tune the levels such that every combination of moves ends up in sensible behavior. The reason he gets stuck in the first example is because Phoebe followed him, then he's trying to move back up, but she's in the way. I'd rather fix stuff like that after fixing the most common problem (which is that players' expectations about where they need Tharin to be to do certain actions don't match our original design, since they can't see the ranges).\n  That sure does look bad. Let's discuss in #135.\n  Great! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) real quick? It's easy. Then I can get this merged in.\n\nThanks!\n  :+1:! :+1:!\n  We haven't finished fixing the tests yet, so all builds fail until we can get the last few.\n  Awesome! Can you do one more thing for me? [Sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) (it's easy).\n  Awesome! Can you do a few more things for me?\n1. [Sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) (it's easy).\n2. Delete the `#` at the beginning of each line that now has a translation (to uncomment it).\n3. Add yourself to [diplomat.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/contribute/diplomat.jade).\n\nThanks!\n Thanks!\n  Awesome! Can you [sign the CLA real quick](http://codecombat.com/cla)? It's easy.\n Cool. I can merge this and add you to the diplomat list as soon as you make some contributions to fr.coffee. One thing we need is for someone to go through #123, make sure we have all the static translations from the Google Doc, and close the doc. Would you be up for that?\n  We've got this working with Clans now.\n  @schmatz Another user reported that sending email to us had a similar cf-ssl45460-protected.codecombat.com resolution error where the email bounced. I wonder if there's something else we can do to make this always work?\n  See [this forum thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/i-think-if-every-leval-has-an-exit-and-save-it-will-be-friendly/215/3). I think a subtle Google Docs / account-settings-style \"Code Saved\" indicator would be useful.\n @phansch I like the implementation now\u2013did you want to do more with it, or shall I close this?\n  What about having the menu as a toolbar at the top, very roughly like this?\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-13 10 34 40](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1903399/7770a0d0-7c81-11e3-8b74-fbede0bf6527.png)\n\nThis would be much easier to implement than drawing it in the Surface relative to where the selected Thang is.\n #762 fixes this way better than I was going to do.\n  This looks cool, but I'm wondering how useful it will be relative to #176. If a Thang is selected and we show the menu, that should be roughly as good as being able to show the menu on hover, right? Selection with a click doesn't seem like a big step, and then we end up with a slightly simpler two ways to display these three options.\n  Ah, that would be nice. We should be able to do this by adding a new Label when Thangs are selected in the level editor.\n @ItsLastDay got this one in.\n  @sderickson I like @bdickason's ideas here. What do you think?\n Trying #547, which is just a simple left-click drag, since we currently have to have the Thang selected before we drag it, and it's actually pretty sweet, so I think I was wrong this whole time about it being unintuitive that drag could either pan the map or drag a unit.\n  We recently realized during a playtest that this should also move the Wizard around the map when playing, too.\n #447 takes care of this for the case of moving the Wizard while playing the level, and the Camera follows then. I guess we still want something for the level editor, too?\n Looks like it's working in the editor now, too. Sweet!\n  @sderickson Given that Anya has been near-completely marginalized upon our decision not to include a guide IndieSprite in most levels, this makes sense to me. Good to remove?\n  Yes, this will be very nice. One question: are we dragging the Thang's portrait, its actual sprite, or both? I'd like to drag the sprite, but we can't easily render that until the cursor gets over the canvas itself. So we could drag the portrait, but then it's hard to position the Thang since you can't see where its sprite will fit exactly. (I guess it's easy to place it initially based on the portrait and then drag the sprite itself for finer control.)\n Good suggestion. I think if we perhaps z-index the canvas above the draggable Thang avatar, then that will happen quite nicely.\n  We should also, before adding these enhancements, refactor those Thang portraits in the [ThangsTabView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs_tab_view.coffee) to use [ThangAvatarViews](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/thang_avatar_view.coffee).\n Okay, so if we don't use ThangAvatarViews, then it shouldn't be too bad to start add customing image embiggening / dragging logic.\n  If I load the home page, press \"Play\", then press \"Home\" in the upper left after Rescue Mission has loaded, then the language select menu no longer opens when I click on it.\n  Probably the Target, Repair, Selection, and Highlight Thangs should never be directly placed\u2013they are intended for the SpriteBoss to use as Marks and don't have any default Components. @bdickason were you wanting to use them for a level directly, or can I just remove them from the Thangs sidebar?\n I've removed these from the sidebar now, as they're not really set up to be placed as top-level Thangs like that.\n  We are already using this: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel\n\nSee [this example](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/Surface.coffee#L370) for how to use:\n\n``` coffee\n    @canvas.bind 'mousewheel', (e) =>\n      # ...\n```\n\nThat should help normalize these events.\n  Wow, double amazing!\n @smoratinos Can you shoot an email to nick@codecombat.com? We have a little fun thing for you.\n  We need to make it so that you can load the level without having any Programmable Thangs. The reason it doesn't run is that the TomeView is waiting for all Programmable Thangs to load their spells before it tells the God to begin simulation, but with no Programmable Thangs, that never happens.\n\nI can write more on how to solve this if anyone's interested; otherwise I'll do it when I get a minute.\n In [app/views/play/level/tome/tome_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/tome_view.coffee#L86), the first spell is only cast when a [Spell](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell.coffee) loads and then all the spells are loaded. Instead, the TomeView should notice when there are no spells and then `cast` immediately.\n Awesome!\n  The Grid needs to be refactored into its own class, putting the lines on the surface layer and the axis numbers on the surface text layer (and making it so you can always see the relevant axis labels). See [a bit about layers here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Surface).\n  By the way, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) if you haven't already?\n  @GlenDC By the way, could you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) if you haven't already?\n It's not 100% bulletproof, but it should get the job done. (Signatures are generally really easy to forge, but we use them all the time anyway.)\n Yup! Your code is already on the live server. :)\n  We should make sure that this never goes onto multiple lines with some CSS:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-10 12 24 43](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1890992/61bb896a-7a35-11e3-9132-6bff634b59cf.png)\n  Hi @Ads20000 \u2013 looking at this, it seems like the problem is on line 16:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.moveXY(75.63);\n```\n\nBecause only the x-coordinate (75.63) is passed, the y-coordinate is null, and so it shows this error message. Really what it should do is actually point out the line number the error occurs on. Let's track that bug over here: https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/4\n  Looking at the BCP 47 list, it seems like this should perhaps be ms (Malay macrolanguage subtag) and then something? Or is \"my\" the code that your browser sends in the Accept-Languages header? (In order to use it, we'll have to add it to locale.coffee, too.\")\n Got it in there now and tested by adding Bahasa Melayu to my Chrome's accept languages. Looks like `ms` is correct. For the future, it'll be helpful if you have the local dev environment set up to make sure that it all compiles in brunch; spotted a few syntax errors.\n  I'm pretty sure that adding more info to the front page, even though it's informative, but it will also dilute the main call-to-action of hitting the \"Play\" button. Really, we want players to hit that and see that the game is awesome instead of reading stuff about how it's awesome.\n\nSince the biggest point of the frontpage is to convert people to playing the game, it's this weird Internet thing where we have to A/B test all the changes we make. I can write up a wiki page on how to set up those A/B tests; it's pretty simple within the CodeCombat system.\n We've got a new design in the pipeline that's almost completely reliant on game art and a video; should be ready soon and look a lot better than the current design.\n  Yeah, awesome!\n  I see what you mean! Until we could adjust the art for that, I've added some rocks behind the cliff so it should be less blend-y.\n\n@gsaines think we could either adjust the cliff or the grass to increase the contrast?\n @sderickson I wanted to use the Thang Editor to darken the green, but perhaps it's not supported to replace default colorization yet?\n There, now the edges are noticeable.\n\n![screenshot 2014-02-01 10 43 14](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2058413/bef639bc-8b70-11e3-9d16-2515f8c4e893.png)\n  \u592a\u597d\u4e86\uff01\u8c22\u8c22\uff01\n  @sderickson I tend to see these kinds of problems sometimes when I have null array entries in places. Nulls are typically the source of half of the Treema bugs, in my experience.\n We introduced a ton of new Treema fixes lately, so that might have fixed whatever was initially causing the issue. I now can't reproduce, either.\n I spoke too soon. Just saw this again, where an introduction script in a level had 15 valid noteGroups in a noteChain and then a null at the end. @sderickson try putting a null in where a noteGroup should be. (I don't know how to get it into this state, just that that's the state where it dies.)\n @sderickson did I remember you saying something about making improvements to null handling in Treema recently, or was that imagination?\n  The current font-family for all h1-h6 elements is `'Bangers', cursive`. This is not a very good font stack in general, not being much of a stack, but worse than that is that Bangers doesn't contain many glyphs used in other languages. See a comparison between English, Russian, and Polish:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-09 14 47 05](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1883082/5047e2ce-7980-11e3-8c1d-0257157ada6f.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-09 14 48 05](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1883083/54fcf084-7980-11e3-95b2-46c444a9de39.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-09 14 48 22](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1883085/58e67c10-7980-11e3-8283-d51d52915e5d.png)\n\nEnglish: cool. Russian: none of the Cyrillic characters are included, so it just ends up looking dumb, plus it's vastly wider than we want. Polish: some of the letters are okay, and then some look quite bad. Most of the other languages are working similarly to Polish in this example.\n\nWhat should we do? Pick a more universal header font? Pick a fallback header font for other languages? The reason we did Bangers is because it has a more game-like feel, which we may not be able to get from a font that has a lot of marketshare, but then again I don't know fonts well.\n I hadn't even thought of getting an artist to do a font. Do you know anyone who does fonts?\n The font is defined in [_variables.scss](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/bootstrap/_variables.scss):\n\n``` scss\n$headingsFontFamily:    'Bangers', cursive;`\n```\n\nWe can think about specifying per-language fonts, tagging the body element with the current language, then having [base.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/base.sass) use those heading fonts instead.\n #### HTML: tag the body with lang\n\n``` html\n<body lang=\"vi\">\n  <h1>I'm a header</h1>\n</body>\n```\n\nYou'd probably just change `$('body').attr('lang', lang)` whenever the user switches the language.\n\n#### base.sass\n\n``` sass\nbody[lang='vi']\n  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\n    font-family: 'Some Vietnamese-compatible font', 'some fallback font', 'another fallback font'\n\n// other languages' fonts here\n```\n It looks like it didn't get accepted to Google Fonts yet, did it? We can try to host our own copies, but the CSS will need tweaking.\n Hmm. Where can we get it? It's not showing up in Google's version, which we're currently using.\n  Looks like it should work; probably a bug in the code. I can check this out more tomorrow.\n @p-buse how about now?\n @p-buse can you try the latest and let me know if you still see the problem?\n I fixed one more bug (the notContainingString was checking the containingString property). I can't reproduce:\n\n![screenshot 2014-02-02 10 40 43](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2060965/e7e21020-8c39-11e3-80dd-889f0da01bdf.png)\n\nNone of my test scripts fire when clicking the background now, which is the bug that I should have fixed with the previous commits. You definitely got (and brunched) the latest code?\n  I saw this when testing and added the quote in, as well as re-indenting `diplomat_suggestion:` on line 85. So it's good.\n  Perfect, thank you! +1\n  Because we didn't have very many names for Thangs, we pick them in order when putting them down, since the good ones were at the beginning. So the first Soldier placed would always be William, and the next would be Lucas, etc. But [now we do](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/53) thanks to contributors, so we should probably now make use of the rest of the names.\n\nIn [ThangsTabView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs_tab_view.coffee), see the calls to `Thang.nextID` and `Thang.resetThangIDs`, which lead to our next-name-picking mechanism in [Thang](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/thang.coffee). This should be refactored so that it just generates the next name randomly, but without picking one that has been generated already. If there are none left, then the strategy of suffixing 1, 2, etc. is still fine, but another way to get unique names would be useful, too.\n I don't think it's wise in this case, because `Thang.nextID` needs to be called from the World simulation background thread sometimes when Thangs are spawning other new Thangs, and that should just be really fast and simple (as opposed to going through the  database). Also, it's precisely in the levels where a ton of Thangs are spawning and using up all the names where the names are least important.\n  Ah, good catch! Can you [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Then I can merge this in.\n  Until we have #22 and eventually #65, we have this Google Doc with a ton of translations in many languages that have not been moved over to the code yet. If anyone wants to help move those over, that'd be awesome. You can do this from the GitHub web editor without even installing the local dev environment. Here's the doc:\n\n[CodeCombat Initial Translations](https://docs.google.com/a/codecombat.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjsR1nOoMQ4MdFBqS1NqUmRTVG1hbEMxWTZEd1JrNXc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)\n\nThere are many languages tabs at the bottom. I can't keep track of which languages have been fully transferred over and which ones have new translations that we need to incorporate. If you have a language (or languages) you want to do, even if you don't actually speak the language, here's what to do:\n1. Pull up the right locale file in [app/locale](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/locale)\n2. Compare the spreadsheet entries and the locale file, making any updates to the locale file.\n3. When you're done, write a big comment in the Google Doc saying that that language is closed and to make any further edits directly to the locale file, and link to this issue.\n4. Send in a pull request for the updated locale file.\n\nThis goes for the static text. The level dialogue translations at the bottom of the sheet can't be put in yet until we have #65, so we'll handle that separately.\n Thanks @fess89! You just check the box at the bottom of [codecombat.com/cla](http://codecombat.com/cla) and we can then accept the pull request, easy as that.\n The text strings that are in the levels don't get translated in these locale files, but rather in the database. We are waiting on #65 for that, since the permissions aren't robust and the interface is confusing now. Until then, @guricchi is moving some translations into the levels manually, but it's a slow process and we can't easily list the strings available for translating yet.\n\nWill get all of those new pull requests merged in today. All builds are failing just yet\u2013there are a few last tests to fix up before that'll be a useful indicator.\n This is now done, so all static text i18n should be done in the GitHub.\n  So right now it's a bit scattered. For translating the text in the levels, we're waiting on #65. We can translate the static interface stuff now as you mentioned above. But there's also this spreadsheet I created:\n\n[CodeCombat Initial Translations](https://docs.google.com/a/codecombat.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjsR1nOoMQ4MdFBqS1NqUmRTVG1hbEMxWTZEd1JrNXc&usp=drive_web#gid=0)\n\nI've made another issue, #123, for help moving those translations over to the code until we can actually have #65 and #22. Another thing that would be useful to do is #23, since not all of the static content can be translated yet.\n  Looks good. I update the style a bit to be more CoffeeScript-y in [3a954ff](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/3a954ff91cebf649050ee2955fdda159d47a1770).\n  IanKelling [reports](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/profile-not-working/171):\n\n\"We couldn't find your profile associated with: -redacted email-. Sign up at Gravatar to get set up!\"\n\nIf I hit refresh on that page, i get \"Loading...\", and nothing ever loads.\n\nedit: I go to gravatar, which implies that I can simply add an email to my account to make it work with the site, but that doesn't work. It seems instead, I have to have a gravatar account with a PRIMARY email address which is the same as the codecombat one.\n I fixed all this stuff and made it so that you don't do any explicit Gravatar configuration. It's still used in the fallback chain, but the priority is now to use the job profile photo (if you're an employer viewing the jobs listings), else use the uploaded profile photo, else use the Gravatar, else use the default wizard ThangType portrait. (It's not colorized with the color configs yet, though.)\n  Great idea! I think we should start hiding the message after they actually press escape, too, since then they know.\n  Currently we are just hard-coding the level descriptions and paths in [play_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play_view.coffee) like this:\n\n``` javascript\n      {\n        name: 'Hunter Triplets'\n        id: 'hunter-triplets'\n        description: \"Three soldiers go ogre hunting.\"\n        image: '/file/db/level/526711d9add4f8965f000002/hunter_triplets_icon.png'\n        difficulty: 2\n      }\n```\n\nBut now almost all the information is available from the database, so we should have the PlayView use a CocoCollection for published, official Levels and load them dynamically instead.\n\nWe are missing two pieces of information:\n1. **Difficulty**: not that important, we can add this or something better back in later.\n2. **Campaign**: currently the levels are organized into campaigns / areas, sort of: \"Beginner Campaign\", \"Random Harder Levels\", \"Multiplayer Arenas\", \"Player-Created\". We probably want to create a Campaign model to organize things, but until we do that, we should still preserve some temporary way of sorting these things. @sderickson ideas? Maybe a `sort` property on the Level model for now, and if it's `none` it doesn't show up here (for all those player-created levels that are published but not really playable)?\n  It's a great shortcut that people want to use, but they don't know that they can. Even if it's small, a little text blurb explaining it might go a long way.\n A very small, faint sort label saying \"esc to skip\" in the HUD dialogue box, yeah--maybe showing up after a slight delay or something like the much more prominent \"Shift+Enter to continue\" button. Just enough such that people looking for a way to do it will find it.\n Yup, just like that. If we also start hiding the esc message after they have learned it, it'll be even better.\n  Right you are! I imagine there will be a lot of such parenthesis cleanup to do.\n Hi @MDP66. Can I get you to [sign the CodeCombat contributor license agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) with your GitHub username? It's easy; just affirms that you have the right to let us use this contribution. Thanks!\n  I think we don't need to avoid trying to load the social media stuff\u2013we just need to not have our JS break when it doesn't work. At least, that's the hypothesis I'll test now.\n @allan-simon would you mind checking to see if this did the trick? Thanks!\n  Good names!\n  Awesome work guys. In response to the question of translating the levels: that's currently waiting on #65.\n  So we'd just make a new LevelSession CocoCollection on the play view and grab the `state.complete` flags when it syncs. I've also added another issue very related to this: #111.\n Fixed in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/8c013c1192791db6aae3755b6d9a2fe91b4836ed\n  I had written up some notes somewhere on how to do this, but now I can't find them. Basically ACE has all these options already and we just need to make an interface to turn them on!\n Can't find them; oh well. Here we go.\n\nHere's an example of all the options ACE lets you configure: [ACE Kitchen Sink Demo](http://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html)\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-08 11 16 34](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1871624/a1efd5f6-7899-11e3-9837-b2aca99daa2a.png)\n\nOf those, we probably want to expose just a handful, to keep options simple for players. These are the possible options with some excluded, with the most likely candidates bolded:\n- **Font Size**\n- Code Folding\n- **Key Binding**\n- Soft Wrap\n- Full Line Selection\n- Highlight Active Line\n- Show Invisibles\n- Persistent HScroll / VScroll  \n- Animate scrolling\n- Highlight selected word\n- **Enable Behaviours**\n- Fade Fold Widgets\n- Enable Elastic Tabstops\n- Incremental Search\n- Show token info\n- Scroll Past End\n\n(Setting the actual code language will be useful once we can support CoffeeScript and others, but might be more involved than just this menu\u2013we'll see.)\n\nEven if we just start off with the key bindings (allowing people to get Emacs / Vim modes going on), that'd be a good start.\n\nSo, how to do it? I imagine we need a few things:\n\n#### Add a button somewhere to pull up a menu.\n\nPerhaps this is just an option in the existing playback settings menu:\n![screenshot 2014-01-08 11 26 45](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1871718/d400245a-789a-11e3-9014-fe6d3a4e90cf.png)\nCode starts here: [app/views/play/level/playback_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/playback_view.coffee)\n\n#### Add a new TomeConfigurationView\n\nThis would be a ModalView that just had a couple menu options in it corresponding to the ACE options we want to expose. See how the [ControlBarView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/control_bar_view.coffee) opens up a [MultiplayerModal](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/modal/multiplayer_modal.coffee). This would just adjust the client-side `me` User to adjust these options, and it would send out [an event](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Events%2C-subscriptions%2C-shortcuts) that the [SpellViews](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee) could subscribe to for updating their ACE instance's options. See [how `music` is set](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/playback_view.coffee) for an example of saving these User properties.\n\n#### Add the ACE preferences to the User model\n\nSee [Coco Models](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Coco-Models) for a start on this. You'd need to add some sort of `aceOptions` object property to the [User schema](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/schemas/user.coffee) and to its [Handler's](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/handlers/user.coffee) `privateProperties` and `editableProperties`.\n @GlenDC is working on this (seems I can't assign him to it).\n #545 fixes this!\n  @dmc56111 it may be easier to debug this with a bit of back-and-forth in [our HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa).\n @jequal have you [updated with the latest database dump](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment#database)?\n This part:\n\nDownload [the public CodeCombat MongoDB sandbox copy backup](http://54.91.159.37/dump.tar.gz) (updated every 10 minutes) and import it into your locally running database with the following steps. \n1. Make sure the database is running on your computer (./bin/coco-mongodb).\n2. If the backup file is compressed, uncompress it (for instance, if it is a .tar.gz file, run `tar xzvf [filename]`) \n3. Step 2 should generate a `dump` folder. To import this run `mongorestore --drop [path to dump]` if mongorestore is in your path. If it's not and you used the script, run `[path to CodeCombat folder]/bin/mongo/mongorestore --drop [path to dump]`\n\nWhen downloading a new dump to keep the database up-to-date, use `mongorestore --drop [path to dump]` to clear out all old data (including any local data you have created) and replace with just the new data.\n I'd need [the stack trace from the JS console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console#opening_the_console) to say for sure. But did these things happen without error?\n1. `npm install`\n2. `bower install`\n3. `bin/coco-brunch`\n4. `bin/coco-mongodb`\n5. `bin/coco-dev-server`\n\nIf all those things worked, then the dev environment should be ready to go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n When you see that message, you should [open the JS console](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console#opening_the_console) to see what the error is, then click the red triangle next to the error to expand the stack trace, then tell me what the stack trace is.\n Oh, I see, now. It's trying to load various fonts, analytics tools, and social network SDKs, but it can't find any of them because either 1) your internet can't access them or 2) they don't apply to domains that aren't codecombat.com or localhost (like LinkedIn). It should still work to use the local dev site, though, so you could ignore that first error message that shows up.\n Does your `bin/coco-dev-server` show any error messages when it gives you those 502s?\n It would be easier to debug this over here: http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa\n  Looks like we've started tagging things as \"good-for-newbies\". If we like that tag, I can add it throughout?\n  Thanks @qubodup!\n  [CheckiO](http://www.checkio.org/) does this particularly well, I thought. You can see other submitted solutions, ranked in various ways, but only after you've submitted yours. Then you can comment and vote on other solutions. It's really interesting to see how other players solved things, especially on harder levels where there are many ways to do it.\n Done, with the new leaderboards. For single-player levels, everyone's solutions except the top 5 are publicly accessible, with replays and all, from the leaderboards screens.\n  Done, with (I hope) most of the major upgrade bugs worked out now. Thanks @TomSteinbrecher!\n  Currently when a new player comes, the page starts to load, it realizes there's no User object created yet, and it says to the server, \"Make me a new User!\" Then when the server responds, the page reloads and all is well\u2013except that we've now thrown away whatever referrer info we might have had to tell us where they came from, and possibly other screwy things that defeat analytics.\n\n@sderickson can you think of a good way to not require this sort of client-initiated first-visit reload behavior in the first place? That would be the cleanest way to solve both this and the other inefficiencies that come with aborting a bunch of HTTP requests when the reload fires.\n  It's not like CodeCombat was ever light on memory consumption, but some players reported 1.4-2.0GB of RAM used when playing Gridmancer, which is far too much. Could be many things:\n1. Lots of big sprite sheets--perhaps we can create them at a lower resolutionFactor in SpriteBoss?\n2. Something to do with caching huge ground / obstacle layers?\n3. Leaks?\n\nWe probably can just dig into it with the Chrome profiler and see what's going on.\n  Does anyone have an actual mouse with a scroll wheel they can test in Safari to see if the zoom direction works the same way as in Chrome/Firefox?\n\nIt should be scroll-down-to-zoom-in, scroll-up-to-zoom-out, which works for me in Safari with my trackpad, but a user reported it backwards in Safari with a real mouse, so wanted to confirm.\n Let's call it good, then.\n  I wrote most of the Components and Systems in my typical style, but now I'm realizing that the best way to write more Components and Systems is to look at existing examples. These don't serve very well for that purpose, but they could if I added a lot more comments indicating what things are doing and linking to documentation.\n It would probably make more sense to keep the documentation tied to the Components and Systems themselves, with maybe a general markdown description property added similar to what they are supposed to have for the individual properties they add to their Thangs:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-13 13 03 46](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1904862/4bce34e6-7c96-11e3-9f34-aa75fcd032a8.png)\n\nWe could make that addition in [the level_component schema](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/schemas/level_component.coffee) and [handler's editableProperties](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/handlers/level_component.coffee) to start writing that documentation. The one thing that would complicate this right now is that we still don't have a good way for letting non-admins edit Components and Systems, so it's not as easy to update as the wiki pages. But I could transfer updates from people's local database copies of them to the live database.\n  - Didn't work for Maksym\n- One user got 'undefined' for a username when they did this\n- I've been unable to log out when I signed out, it just logged me back in\n  @TomSteinbrecher This looks pretty good, and I know I said to duplicate the character class descriptions for now, but it could more [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) on the character navigation sidebar if we used a [Jade template include](http://jade-lang.com/reference/#includes) to have the a separate contribute_nav.jade which is included in each characters' nav.\n\nSimilarly, adding a ContributorClassView to include the email checkbox subscription handling code and leaving views like the ArchmageView to just subclass that and override the template would improve it further.\n\nI can merge this and then make those changes, or if you want to see what I mean, you can try it--which would you prefer?\n Nice job! I cleaned up the nav sidebar links so that they still work regardless of the nesting level and merged it in.\n  @smoratinos did #76 fix the CLA problem in Firefox? \n  Would love to merge, but `readlink -f` isn't available on Mac, so it doesn't run there. Is there a way to do it that's cross-platform?\n Actually, I talked to @schmatz and we need to redo some of the test scripts, so we'll do this Linux-style for now and then get them refactored like the coco-brunch scripts work.\n  I haven't looked into this much yet. It should be kind of like #71 for adding CoffeeScript, except that we also need to:\n1. Find/adapt/write a parser from Python to the Mozilla AST format\n2. Handle the important parts of the Python standard library\n3. ??? I'm sure there's something else obvious to anyone who actually knows compilers\n\nThe same thing goes for Ruby, Haskell, and every other non-JS-based language that could conceivably be mostly transpiled to JavaScript. I know there are several projects that already parse Python in JavaScript for running it in the browser, and the same for Haskell. If anyone even knows what else we'd need to do or which projects we should start to try to adapt, please comment.\n\nIt would be awesome to have CodeCombat support a bunch of different programming languages so that players have their choice of which language to learn or to use for programming challenges.\n Can check out [Brython](http://brython.info/) and [a few others](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/skulpt/WeFe9inRO3Q) for Python.\n I actually had this in the original prototype, but as far as I can tell, there isn't an easy way to pull out just the parsing part\u2013they're compiling the entire interpreters with emscripten, but CodeCombat can't use a full interpreter; it needs to do its own transpiling and running after getting just the AST. I could be wrong, though; I'm no compiler whiz.\n I thought about it a little bit and wrote up this answer for someone asking what would be involved for doing C [over on ChallengePost](http://codecombat.challengepost.com/forum_topics/3001-i-d-like-to-try-writing-a-parser-for-c?page=1):\n\nC would be a great language to add, although because it's so different from JavaScript, it's not exactly clear what all the tricky bits will be. Have you seen the Mozilla abstract syntax tree format that other JS tools like Esprima and Acorn generate from JavaScript code or that the CoffeeScript Redux compiler generates from CoffeeScript code? Your C parser should do two things:\n\n1) Using JavaScript/CoffeeScript, parse C code into this AST format.\n2) Add a JavaScript/CoffeeScript runtime library that adds functionality needed to run the C code (types, language features, basic standard libraries).\n\nFor a trivial example, imagine this code (please excuse any C mistakes, it's been a while):\n\n``` c\nint foo = 8;\nfloat bar = 5 * sizeof foo;  // bar = 5 * 4 = 20.0\nfloat baz = bar / foo;  // baz = 20.0 (float) / 8 (int) = 3.0  (integer division truncates)\n```\n\nYour code might translate it it into an AST which, when then generating concrete JavaScript code again, could end up like this:\n\n``` javascript\n// We'll need to store the types of all the variables we define.\nvar __types = {'foo': __c.types.int, 'bar': __c.types.float, 'baz': __c.types.float};\nvar foo, bar;\n\n// This part is easy, at least!\nfoo = 8;\n\n// We'll need to use a JS function to emulate C's sizeof operator.\nbar = 5 * __c.functions.sizeof(__types['foo']);\n\n// We'll need to use another function to emulate C's float / integer division truncation.\nbaz = __c.functions.divide({value: bar, type: __types['bar']}, {value: 'foo', type: __types['baz']});\n```\n\nSo for this example, your runtime library (__c) would need to define functions.sizeof, functions.divide, and all the types.\n\nYou wouldn't need to handle every possible piece of C code\u2013it's not like we care about writing files and doing stdio and such things, and if some of the really advanced semantics are a bit different, we can live with that. But the basic stuff like you might use to play CodeCombat levels should be there. And since CodeCombat's API is object-oriented, then there'll have to be some syntax for emulating things like this:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.attack(this.getNearbyEnemy());\n```\n  This shouldn't be that bad, actually--the [CoffeeScript Redux](https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux) compiler should already be parsing things into the Mozilla abstract syntax tree format, at which point we can use the rest of the existing Aether tooling to just run it with the rest of our World simulation.\n\nImplementing it will mostly be handling all the little things that come up, like adding options for players to use JavaScript or CoffeeScript, reformatting docs and code examples to not assume JS syntax, adding Aether options to know to expect CoffeeScript, and integrating the CoffeeScript Redux parser.\n I think the first thing to do would be to see if we can add get the CoffeeScript Redux compiler running in the browser in CodeCombat. The second thing to do would be to see if we can tell it to just give us the AST instead of compiling all the way to JavaScript (since otherwise Aether would have to parse it again). If those work, we could integrate them into the Aether project and tell it to parse the user code as CoffeeScript instead of using Esprima and thinking it's JavaScript.\n\nA little bit of https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/99 would let the player specify whether to code in CoffeeScript or JavaScript.\n @deepak1556 has landed CoffeeScript support in Aether, so now we need #99 in order to let the player specify CoffeeScript mode.\n #99 is ready for anyone to add CoffeeScript support to the editor, and we can fix up the LevelSessions and such to know what language the code is in as we see what needs doing trying to  hook it up.\n #748 yeeees!\n\nI imagine there will be bugs and places (like multiplayer code evaluation) that need updating to know the language, but we can make specific issues for those as we find them.\n  A lot of times, I want to link directly to a [Component](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component) or [System](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/System), but instead I have to say, \"Go into the level editor and click on it (and if it's not there, then add a Thang that uses it, then go back into the Components tab and it'll be there).\" This is not great.\n\nIt would be nicer to display a Component or System and its code nicely just from a URL, even if we can't edit it from there. @sderickson what would the recommended steps be for adding that route / view?\n I have a very gimpy way of doing this for any model with a [ModelModal](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/modal/model_modal.coffee). We could hook that up. But better to open it in the context of a level, I agree.\n  @TomSteinbrecher Are you still seeing these bugs? I think I resolved them in [118573](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/1185731fd042770fd539e88cdc4b8b28f3bc4b1f).\n  I talked with @nwinter about this and we decided that building out our existing system seems better than trying to work in pot and po files into the database objects. With the new patch system, we're already most of the way there, and we want translations to be integrated into the site where we can keep track of them and tie them in with a reward system, rather than external. The pot and po files also wouldn't be able to handle non-text translations (like audio files, or JSON objects) as well as what we've already got. We think the JSON/Treema system of having the translations integrated with the data will end up being the best way forward.\n\nGiven where we are four months after creating this issue and the patch system has been built recently, there are only a few things left to do to make editing database entities complete, and match or surpass a pot/po system:\n- Have editors populate i18n objects in documents whenever changes are made, so they are present.\n- Create a new view tab which takes a document and finds all i18n objects and lays them out for diplomats to translate, and to see existing translations (pending in patches or already saved in the document).\n- Have editors mark translations as needing review when the base text or other data has changed.\n\nThese are basically all JSON-walking tasks and some simple interface building. This should handle the case when base text changes, and keep things integrated with the site, and with the patch system it shouldn't be hard for editors to come in and make improvements to existing translations, as @GlenDC mentioned would be useful. Regarding seeing these translations in context, that'll be a little harder, since you would need to play through the level entirely and hit all scripts in order to see all dialogue boxes in context (along with anything else translated), but having the translation system integrated with the editor would help by having it be possible to test the translations in context, whereas an external editor would not.\n\nIf this system works well, we may consider something similar for the site in general, where we have an interface object which can be edited by diplomats, and store the site strings in the database, rather than having them as files which everyone must load as part of app.js.\n\nWhat do you guys think, @mquinson , @GlenDC , @phanimahesh ?\n @phanimahesh Basically in any case where the object in the JSON has two or more properties that are related that can be different between languages. The one example I can think of that happens now is an object that has the text and the audio file of a piece of dialogue. There may be other use cases in the future. For example, I can imagine a case where a JSON object represents a link, and both the text and the url need to be translated, such as to a wikipedia article for a topic. These are cases where the object as a whole should be translated, rather than each piece separately.\n\nThanks for your input guys!\n Thanks to some heroic hacking by @sderickson, It's ready! We are going to send out a big Diplomat email soon. Try it out now and let us hear your feedback and bugs: http://codecombat.com/i18n\n\n@Imperadeiro98 @enricpc @Titounkle @kerradus @wakeup @AbnerZheng @Hamtara @gabrielcesar \u2013 would love for y'all to take it for a spin.\n  It's not obvious enough yet when code error alerts come up--beginners will tell us that they didn't notice the big red error message when we do UX tests. Here are what things look like now:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-03 21 36 54](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1844135/414ddd96-7502-11e3-855a-f003a3dfa92f.png)\n\nPart of the problem is that it's down there at the bottom, too far away. We used to have it floating below the last line of code, but that often doesn't solve the problem if the player isn't looking at the bottom of the code anyway, and then it moves around, so instead we gave it a dedicated space at the bottom of the spell editor.\n\nThings to try:\n1. Animating the error alert in when it appears\n2. Playing a sound when it appears\n3. Trying a more visible design\n\nSee the [Tome docs](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Tome) for info about the spell editor.\n#### Relevant files\n- [app/views/play/level/tome/problem_alert_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/problem_alert_view.coffee)\n- [app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee)\n- [app/styles/play/level/tome/problem_alert.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level/tome/problem_alert.sass)\n- [app/templates/play/level/tome/problem_alert.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/level/tome/problem_alert.jade)\n Ah--that'll be related to getting line error numbers in Aether working again, after which both of those things would happen automatically on the errored-out line, similar to if one made a syntax error. If someone wants to work on that, I've written up the steps over here: https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/4\n\nAether isn't documented very well yet as an open source project, but before that happens, I'd be happy to work with people to get set up with it.\n If we did that, it would start covering up code above it, since often the code will go right down to the bottom border of the editor (above the cast button). I feel like adding a sound effect and fade-in animation would probably be better, and we could see if it's still a problem visually after that.\n Often people will get annoyed when an error pops up, because they want to finish their code and make it go away, or they know about the warning message and want to ignore it for now. So it has to be both out of the way but noticeable, right? It is hard to satisfy all the people all the time. ;)\n  Along with issues like #48 and #49 to make the item collection/transfer animations cool, we'll also want to add a new inventory display and to improve the support for managing objects in an `inventory.Collects` [Thang](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Thang)'s inventory.\n### Display\n\nIf you add `inventory` to a Thang's `ui.Selectable` Component's `extraHUDProperties` configuration:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-03 14 38 45](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1843012/d67b4d26-74c7-11e3-8894-ee171335cf43.png)\n\n--then you'll see something like this when you select that Thang in the level:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-03 14 42 00](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1843026/45ff3748-74c8-11e3-9a48-24c4892a05ce.png)\n\nSo we have a rudimentary inventory display already, but it doesn't have icon support for the things in the inventory, and it's way too small to make a core part of gameplay. So one thing to do would be to add icons there. Another thing to do, perhaps later, would be to make a separate visual interface for these things to give them the proper weight; I can suggest implementation details if someone suggest a visual design.\n### Inventory Mechanics\n\nRight now, the `inventory` property of an `inventory.Collects` Thang is just an array, and in that array are the `id` strings of `inventory.Collectable` Thangs that the collector has collected. That's it. All the logic on top of that is a total hack. Also, when a collectable Thang is collected, it assigns its `collectableProperties` to the collector--you can see the code for that in `inventory.Collects`. It's just a hack to get potions to work.\n\nWe should improve/replace all that code so that we can do things like reference actual Thangs which have been collected, have logic for what it means to have various Thangs in one's inventory, and extend collection to also include dropping / transferring / using / combining collected Thangs.\n  Perhaps you'd add a `display.Tinted` Component to do coloring outside of teams. (I added a `ui.Tinted` placeholder that doesn't do anything before we added the Display System, which is a better place for it.) The Alliance System would probably also let you configure which colors belonged to which teams/superteams, as well as what the names of those teams were. (Currently they're kind of autogenerated from what the `alliance.Allied` Components happen to say the teams are within a level.)\n\nAll these Components/Systems need to do is attach a single `tintHue` property to their Thangs / teams.\n  Most ThangTypes are set to rotation: \"isometric\", meaning that they don't visually rotate until they snap past certain thresholds (left, right, back, fore). If you set the Thang's `rotation` property, you should see it rotate.\n  Is this a Discourse FB login button problem or a CodeCombat FB login button problem?\n Sure; and if you're lumping, then let's also lump this old Trello:\n\nAdjust Discourse to point to http://codecombat.com/images/pages/base/logo.png instead of /images/logo.png\n Probably a Discourse update or reconfiguration fixed it? @schmatz good to close?\n  Our Collision [System](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/System) currently lets Thangs with collision category `ground_and_air` collide with each other. This means that missiles like Arrows and Spears will knock each other out of the air. This is pretty cool sometimes, but most of the time it doesn't make sense. (Or if they don't collide, it's because I turned it off somewhere I'm not seeing--we don't have a lot of arrow-heavy levels right now, so I haven't double-checked.)\n\nCollision detection in CodeCombat is handled by [Box2D](https://code.google.com/p/box2dweb/), which as one might guess only does collisions in two dimensions--the x- and y-dimensions. CodeCombat wants just about all of the gameplay logic to stay two-dimensional, since for most programming environments, it just makes more sense and it is simpler for gameplay. Our [graphics are 2.5D](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Surface#camera) to make things look better. Our positions and shapes are actually 3D, but in most cases we don't determine behavior from the z-dimension.\n\nI think in this case we should, since when there's a rain of missiles, they all bounce off of each other whenever their shadows would touch. If two Thangs are firing at each other at nearly the same time, then this always happens, and sometimes they can never kill each other! It's kind of funny if two identical units are shooting each other's arrows out of the air by firing at the same instant and angle and speed, but if an Arrow Tower is going up against a Fangrider, those trajectories are totally different and shouldn't result in a collision.\n\nSince Box2D can't natively handle z, we'll have to reach in and use its [ContactListener PreSolve](http://www.box2dflash.org/docs/2.1a/reference/) to stop the collision if the z distances don't touch. I hope this will work. Perhaps if not, we can resort to another more clever or more hacky way to do it.\n\nWe would modify the Collision [System](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/System) from within the level editor, and perhaps work with or look at the `collision.Collides` [Component](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component), the `combat.Arrow` Component, and the [CollisionCategory class remnant](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/systems/collision.coffee).\n @sderickson We'll need this soon to make archer vs. thrower battles work. Either of us could dig into it, but it'd also be a nice Archmage task if anyone felt so inclined, so keep your eye out for someone who likes missile collisions.\n I made missiles never collide with each other a while back until we can figure out the z-index collision stuff properly.\n Now that I think about it, it would mess up a bunch of things with the game balance to make similar-z-height missiles collide now, and be less performant, so let's just not\u2013no shooting missiles out of the air, and no standoff duels.\n  Various parts of the game engine \"rely\" on being able to tell whether Thangs contain or intersect each other, or how far away their nearest edges are. Thangs are either ellipses or rectangles, and may be rotated.\n\nI haven't actually finished the geometry calculations to determine most of the rectangle-rectangle, rectangle-ellipse, or ellipse-ellipse distances, intersections, or containment, especially with rotation.\n\nSo currently most of the calculations which would depend on those are hacked around--instead of Thangs being able to collect or melee attack each other if they're touching, instead they can do so if their center points are closer than their `attackRange` or `collectRange` or whatever silly nonsense property I have. This is fiddly and not good.\n\nSince this is so CodeCombat-agnostic as to not require figuring out good test cases within the game engine itself, I've pulled out the relevant code into a Codepen so it'll be easy to play with:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 16 34 41](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1836781/df19a1b2-740e-11e3-8199-fa490f9a3c58.png)\n\n[http://codepen.io/nwinter/pen/itsgx](http://codepen.io/nwinter/pen/itsgx)\n\nUpdate--Julia has made some progress here: [http://codepen.io/julenka/pen/DkEtb](http://codepen.io/julenka/pen/DkEtb)\n\nFork that, have fun, and do however much you want to do toward:\n1. Getting my simple tests at the bottom to work by calculating distances from edges instead of centers\n2. Adding more tests to make sure\n3. Making it work with rotation\n4. Filling in methods like Thang.intersects and Thang.contains in addition to Thang.distance.\n\nIt might be helpful to also add a simple graphics layer that draws the shapes you're working with in Thang's toString() method (before it returns the string).\n\nOr if one prefers, they can hack on the [Vector](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/vector.coffee) and [Rectangle](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/rectangle.coffee) code in the repo itself, with some of it being in the `physics.Physical` Component in the level editor. Adding tests to our [testing system](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Testing) would be pretty sweet, too.\n @bnosrat is also working on this now. How's it going?\n @bnosrat could you post your code somewhere, maybe on a Codepen? Might be interesting to split this up and let some others collaborate / look at some parts of it.\n I checked out the posted Codepen and it seems like it's the earlier version where Ellipse contains is done, but I don't see intersects. Is there a new pen link?\n The reason that there aren't commits related to this, and that the code is worked on on Codepen, is because the code really lives inside the `physics.Physical` [Components](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component), and we don't yet have more than very basic version control and permissions on those. #264 would help there.\n @bnosrat Wow, no wonder I wasn't able to just figure out ellipse-ellipse intersection when I was doing the first pass here\u2013that's looking kind of hairy. Is there a simpler method that we could use that would be imperfect but close enough?\n @bnosrat Speed is pretty important here, so that first option doesn't sound totally amazing, but maybe if we used something coarse like 8 steps, it would be close enough. Is that second hairy example going to be faster?\n\n@Snipx Looking good! Want to add some more test cases? If we get a good number of tests, it will be a lot easier for me to integrate everything and be sure I haven't broken it, and then we can optimize performance with confidence, too.\n Ah, great! So correct me if I'm wrong, but is the only case remaining to be handled just this thorny ellipse-ellipse intersection?\n Sorry @bnosrat, it's proving to be a bit tricky to find a big batch of time to get this integrated into the system, since the major version change to the Physical Component needs to be very well tested, it being the first major version change that we have done so far\u2013not all the versioning system is built for it. I'm on the lookout for a long block of time where I can really focus on merging and testing it.\n Let's call it done, then! Nice work, everyone.\n  In the `programming.Programmable` [Component](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Component), the player's code runs within a context that is a copy of part of the [World](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/World), limited to the properties specified in `programmableProperties`. So for example, if I'm coding `chooseAction()` for my Artillery, I might have;\n\n``` javascript\nprogrammableProperties = [\n  'pos', 'setTarget', 'setAction', 'getNearestEnemy', 'say', 'attackRange'\n];\n```\n\nAll this code should work:\n\n``` javascript\nvar enemy = this.getNearestEnemy();\nif(this.pos.distance(enemy.pos) < this.attackRange) {\n  this.setTarget(enemy);\n  this.setAction('attack');\n  this.say('Die, ' + enemy.id + '!');\n}\n```\n\nSo we need the `getNearestEnemy`, `setTarget`, `setAction`, and `say` methods to actually interact with the World to get the enemy and set the target and action and such. But this code should not work:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.world.abort();\n// Good--doesn't work, because world isn't in context\n\nthis.getNearestEnemy().world.abort();\n// Oops, that was the real world, wasn't it?\n\nthis.getNearestEnemy().health = -9001;\n// Yup, you just killed it!\n\nthis.pos.z = 100;\n// Good--doesn't work because this is just a copy of this.pos\n\nthis.getNearestEnemy().getNearestEnemy().pos.z = 100;\n// Aaaaa--<splat>\n```\n\nI was trying to get around this with `Object.defineProperty` and marking things readonly and such, but I ran into some bugs where it wouldn't work. More testing is needed. Also, more thinking, since I'm a bit confused myself as to how best to do this. I originally thought that making a copy-only context, running the code in that, and them pulling the necessary changes out with a whitelist approach would do it, but then I ran into these problems and made the functions refer to the real functions, and now we have neither full security nor full versatility.\n Unless I misunderstand, I think we can handle that sort of restricting access to the function context already. Here's an example of how the Programmable Component is currently doing it:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/zQjmg67z\n\nRelevant part:\n\n``` coffee\n    # ...\n    inner = aether.createFunction()\n    outer = (args...) ->\n      userContext = @createUserContext()\n      try\n        result = inner.apply userContext, args\n      catch error\n        @handleProgrammingError error, methodName\n        @replaceMethodCode methodName, null  # no-op when this method is called\n        result = null\n      @updateFromUserContext userContext  # Apply any viable changes they actually made in the context to the real objects\n      return result\n\n  # ...\n\n  createUserContext: ->\n    ctx = {}\n    thang = @\n    props = _.union @programmableProperties, @extraProgrammableProperties\n    for prop in props\n      value = @[prop]\n      v2 = value\n      if _.isFunction value\n        do (prop, v2, thang) ->\n          value = =>\n            result = v2.apply thang, arguments  # Functions use original thangs\n            # But then the context also needs to get updated with any new state that happened as a result of the function call!\n            # (this.setTarget(obj) gives thang.target == obj, but not ctx.target == obj)\n            for anotherProp in props\n              newValue = thang[anotherProp]\n              unless _.isFunction newValue\n                ctx[anotherProp] = newValue\n            result\n      # Object.defineProperty doesn't work in web worker in my test, no idea why; works in Chrome console\n      #Object.defineProperty ctx, prop, {value: value, writable: false, enumerable: true}\n      # It does seem to work in IE 9 and 10 but not 11 and then make it so the property isn't updatable.\n      # Or something. Man, that was a terrible bug. An endless ocean of blood was spilt here.\n      ctx[prop] = value  # so doing this instbead\n    for prop in @userCreatedProperties\n      ctx[prop] = @[prop]\n    ctx\n\n  updateFromUserContext: (ctx) ->\n    for own prop, value of ctx\n      if (prop in @programmableProperties) or (prop in @extraProgrammableProperties) then continue\n      unless prop in @userCreatedProperties\n        if @[prop]? then continue\n        @userCreatedProperties.push prop\n      if prop in @userCreatedProperties\n        @[prop] = value\n```\n Working on a way to do this over in Aether:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/protectAPI.coffee\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/transforms.coffee#L183-L190\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/test/protect_api_spec.coffee\n\nIt's pretty much the slowest, most brutish thing I could think of that might work: every time user code gets access to an object (through an argument to the method being defined, through the \"this\" value, or through the return value of some method call), Aether replaces it with a deep clone that has access only to properties listed in the object's \"apiProperties\" array, but with any methods within bound to the original objects (so that things like setters still work to update the game). Then when user code sends out an object (through the return value or a method call), Aether restores original value from the clone.\n\nStill a long way to go on this, but maybe it will work.\n Despite the horrifying complexity of my approach, I think I've pretty much got it. Let the hacking attempts commence. Anyone who can still modify the supposedly read-only properties of other Thangs from within CodeCombat spells wins my grudging admiration!\n  The entire Inventory [System](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/System) is just a temporary hack right now and could use more thought in order to make useful levels that do more with inventory and items. I know Mischa's team will need more power here, so perhaps they can spearhead a new implementation of it.\n\nOne of the things we need to do is to make item pickup much cooler. Currently the item just disappears and possibly plays a sound. What it should do instead of just disappearing is to momentarily float above the collector's head, possibly with a cloud or bubble behind it, as it plays the sound, _then_ disappear. This would look pretty good and would allow us to let any sprite collect any other sprite without having any sprite-specific collect or collected animations. Here's a hacky example:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 14 19 48](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1836096/5f7d58e8-73fc-11e3-971e-6875d03f33bf.png)\n\nIt should feel really cool, like Link picking up a sweet item in Legend of Zelda. Having awesome pickup noises per item will also help with that; those are already ready.\n\nRelated to that, I know Mischa's team was thinking of being able to give and receive items between Thangs. It would be good to have this item-in-bubble-over-head animation code also support transferring the item, so maybe it first appears above the donor's head, then moves over to the receiver's head, then disappears.\n\nMaking items look better is also related to making them bobbing from #48.\n\nThe code for this will start in [app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee) and could possibly extend to [SpriteBoss](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/SpriteBoss.coffee) and perhaps a new class designed for this purpose. [Mark](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/Mark.coffee) and [Label](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/Label.coffee) might be useful examples.\n It should happen off of the `currentEvents` property. See how [CocoSprite](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee#L412) reads this for playing sounds for the events that happened that frame. I think there are already events added for `collected` or something like that in the `inventory.Collects` Component.\n  When arrows/spears get stuck in the ground, they should appear buried in the ground. We have a die animation that cuts off the points, but we aren't 1) using it or 2) adjusting the rotation to make them point down into the ground.\n\n_Our arrow die state:_\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 13 43 22](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1835828/efb90f84-73f6-11e3-9f5d-7cdb127dabb5.png)\n\n_When an arrow misses and lodges into the ground, it should look kind of like this:_\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 13 47 48](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1835861/9dab1146-73f7-11e3-89ab-4503b322376d.png)\n### Adding the \"die\" action\n\nIn the `combat.Arrow` Component (edit the code in the level editor), which serves for both Arrow and Spear ThangTypes, do something like what the `combat.Shell` Component does to set the `action` to `\"die\"` when the missile gets stuck in the ground. That should trigger the `die` action animation in the [CocoSprite](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Surface#cocosprite). We'll also need to add the `action.Acts` Component to the Thang. (I can add that to the Arrow and Spear ThangType default Components when it's ready.)\n### Pointing into the ground\n\nSee #46 for some info on adjusting the apparent rotation / skew / transform properties in general. We'd want to adjust those also so that the arrows and spears appear to be buried in the ground, even though their velocity and rotation may no longer be meaningful (as they're not moving). So you'd add code in [app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee) in perhaps the `updateRotation` or `updateAction` methods.\n Hmm, it seems like we need to add some code to stop drawing the shadow for arrows and spears that are dead, which we could try out in CocoSprite by checking if the ThangType name is \"Arrow\" or \"Spear\". If that works, we can make the shadow diameter specific to particular animations rather than the whole ThangType.\n\nIt sounds like the action being set to \"die\" is working? Or do I misunderstand?\n By Jove, you're right! So the only step left to do is to add action.Acts to existing levels' Arrows and Spears and to stop drawing the shadow Mark when they are dead and their ThangType name is 'Arrow' or 'Spear'. Do you want to try editing CocoSprite to turn that shadow off?\n I've modified the arrow slightly so that instead of needing to use `diesOnHit` (which prevents them from bouncing), they just always die when they hit the ground (instead of hitting a target or an obstacle). I am adding `Acts` to all the arrows and spears, and it'll be in there by default for new instances in the level editor.\n\nSo now we just need to be able to disable the shadow appropriately.\n  Currently when an Archer or Arrow Tower shoots an Arrow, the Arrow does properly rotate in the x-y plane so that it's facing its target, but it doesn't handle the other ones (yaw? pitch? roll?). So it doesn't point up when its z-velocity is positive, nor down when it's negative. It also doesn't appear shorter when flying more parallel to the camera's line of sight than it does when flying orthogonally.\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 12 11 52](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1835166/51c59e48-73ea-11e3-882a-4dae3dc1756b.png)\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 12 13 06](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1835167/555a03d2-73ea-11e3-8acc-3d6424a7fb15.png)\n\nI think one would just need to do some math to update the Arrow [Thang](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Thang)'s [CocoSprite](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Surface#cocosprite) `imageObject` [transform properties](http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/DisplayObject.html#method_setTransform) or their shorthands (`scaleX`, `skewY`, `rotation`, etc.) according to the `velocity` of the Arrow and the [Camera](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Surface#camera)'s view. I was trying to do it but got confused. If you like affine transforms or computer graphics, you might have some fun with this one!\n\nIt's easy to test: just [play Zone of Danger](http://codecombat.com/play/level/zone-of-danger) and get the arrows looking good. You might want to make the arrows travel a lot slower by editing their `maxSpeed` in their `movement.Moves` Component, which would emphasize their arcs. One of the reasons arrows travel so fast now is that they don't look good when actually needing to arc.\n\nThe code to write may be in or related to [app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee) in the `updateScale` and `updateRotation` methods.\n Wow, thanks for figuring all that out. I've pulled in your changes and now added a \"maximizesArc\" config property to the Arrow, so you can toggle the old behavior vs. the new behavior. Check it out in the Arrow code in the live site.\n\nI liked how the arrows were arcing, but I realized that it had the same problem that everything else which arcs has: it looks too floaty. I think this is because we're using realistic world gravity of 9.82 m/s^2, but everything in the game is kind of super-sized. I tried setting Zone of Danger's gravity to 30 m/s^2 and the arrow arcs and jumping looked much cooler. I might try this on some more levels, too. If you grab the latest DB, you can try toggling the maximizesArc on in the Arrow config to see how it looks.\n\nI think that the change to gravity also made it so that attacking enemies[0] fails once more\u2013at least, when I just tried it, it loses, whereas actually hitting the nearest one does succeed.\n I like this for Dungeon Arena, and it works when we are using `maximizesArc` (which I sadly don't think we'll be able to use in existing levels without a lot of rebalancing, but can use going forward), but something is up when they're flying along a straighter path:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-23 13 57 07](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2494593/ebf4a76c-b2cd-11e3-873b-6c9d7aac7580.png)\n\nI'm merging it in, but only when `maximizesArc` is true for now.\n\nWe don't yet have a way to selectively merge in part of the new dump. If you need stuff from your current DB and also from the new DB, then it has to be a manual process, either of bringing forward your old things after restoring the new dump, or of manually grabbing the new part of the new DB.\n I guess the thing that is needed is to not just infer the arrow's position along its flight path by its z-velocity, because that only works if the arrow is shooting from a position with equal z to its target. It should take into account the difference between the start and end z-values.\n Thanks for the diagram and for explaining it more. I played around with it and came up with something that appears to work almost perfectly in all the different cases I tried:\n\n``` coffee\n      vz = @thang.velocity.z\n      if vz and speed = @thang.velocity.magnitude(true)\n        vx = @thang.velocity.x\n        heading = @thang.velocity.heading()\n        xFactor = Math.cos heading\n        zFactor = vz / Math.sqrt(vz * vz + vx * vx)\n        rotation -= xFactor * zFactor * 45\n```\n\nNow I don't know why the `45` isn't `90`, which is what I thought it should be, but I'm always rusty at these things.\n  The biggest problem when trying to do harder levels in CodeCombat is that players have only one way of debugging their code:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.say(\"Rect is at \" + rect.x + \", \" + rect.y + \" with size \" + rect.width + \" x \" rect.height\");\n```\n\nIt took me 30 seconds just to type that out, _and_ I made a syntax error. This is not okay. As a Hacker News commenter [put it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6976883):\n\n\"Only the very darkest realm would deprive its wizards of the mighty printf spell! To what Silicon demon legion did you pledge fealty to summon this coding abomination upon an unsuspecting land? Winter is truly coming at last.\"\n\nSo why is debugging so bad? Well, for one, [serializing things across the web worker boundary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/The_structured_clone_algorithm) is imperfect--you can't pass most [World](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/World) objects because they'll point to [Thangs](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Thang) and Vectors and such which contain functions--and very slow if you're sending strings for each step of your algorithm for each frame of the simulation. So not only do you get really boring and unhelpful log statements like \"Rect is at [Object object]\", but it's very easy to blow up the simulation performance, and you have to either add a better UI than `this.say()` for seeing the messages or force the player to go to the browser console. We used to do this, but we shut it off.\n\nWe could solve most of these problems, but there is a better way. An amazing way. Just lurking, waiting for us to have time to implement it. CodeCombat's programming environment should allow us to build a time-travel debugging interface that combines the best of both breakpoint-based stepping debuggers and using log statements, but far better than either. It'll be [quite Victorian](http://vimeo.com/36579366#t=21m08s). You'll just **scrub back and forward through your code's execution history and hover over any variable to see its value at any point in time**.\n\n[jsdares](http://jsdares.com/) actually does something like this already:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-02 10 06 03](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1834208/92ab2520-73d8-11e3-82eb-21f3071092e2.png)\n\nIn its solution, each statement generates a step message, and when you over over that statement's frame number, it shows the step message below the statement. It also uses blue dots to show which statements were recently executed or will execute. Finally, on the left you can see it shows the values of all currently defined variables. [@janpaul123's thesis](https://github.com/janpaul123/jsdares/blob/master/misc/thesis/thesis-jan-paul-posma.pdf) discusses the interface and motivations in Chapter 3, although the implementation has advanced beyond the thesis since its writing. There is some discussion of how it's done in Chapter 4.\n\nI was thinking of implementing something different. Instead of trying to show all variables and their values, I'd prefer to focus on one variable when the player hovers over it. CodeCombat variables are often complex objects like [Thangs](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Thang), so a simple string isn't going to be enough to get a good picture of their state. You might want to see a Thang's `pos` property, or perhaps even its `target.target.id` to see who its enemy is attacking. Clearly we're not going to serialize all that state for every variable for every frame for every Programmable method.\n\nInstead, what I plan to do is to keep the simulated [World](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/World) around in the web worker thread, possibly more than one at various intervals to make things even faster, and resimulate up until the current call whenever this kind of debugging info is requested. Then we can use Aether to thoroughly inspect the state of all accessible properties, serialize everything we can, and send it over for custom presentation that's aware of our common types (like Thangs and Vectors).\n\n![2014-01-02 11 30 16](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1834846/bb46ab7e-73e4-11e3-8e91-92f2fb675412.jpg)\n\nI think the delay should be just a split second on most levels--suitable for idly hovering over various variables in the code to check them out. Then when the player wants to see a variable change over time, she can just scrub the playback and watch the variable change. It should be especially fast scrubbing forward, since we'll already have the World simulated up until the current frame and can just get the next frame--but it shouldn't be too bad going backwards, either.\n\nWith some cleverness plus the insanity of Aether's control flow yielding, we should also be able to scrub/step forward and backward within the current function execution on a statement-by-statement basis. We probably can't use the main playback scrubber for this, but perhaps some keyboard shortcut or traditional step forward/back/over/out buttons for when one wants to get really fine-grained could do the trick. jsdares experimented with a second timeline sort of interface, since beginners are confused by stepping debugger buttons, but as I recall having two was also confusing.\n\nTo implement this, we'll also need to do a bunch of improvements over [in the Aether project, where I've added a companion issue](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/2). This issue can track the progress on the front-end interface as well as the coordination of Aether state harvesting and World resimulation in the background thread.\n\nIf we can pull this off well (and polish up some other editor rough edges), it has the potential to turn CodeCombat into the best environment for solving programming challenges that the world has ever seen, since not only will be there a sweet visual interface to see what's going on and gameplay mechanics to make it fun, but the overly powerful debugging, live-coding, and co-op multiplayer should make it possible to solve harder algorithms than you'd be able to do in a traditional environment--programming without a blindfold on, as it were.\n A challenge! Yeah, I wasn't prioritizing this until we did Gridmancer\u2013the need for it in harder challenges became painfully clear then.\n Made some progress on this\u2013see screenshot at end of [the Gridmancer blog post](http://blog.codecombat.com/having-your-algorithms-ass-kicked-by-the-internet).\n @janpaul123 I haven't really finished it, it's not too pretty, it's often slow, there are no step messages, there's no time-abstracted variable display, and there are many edge cases left to handle for which variables can be inspected, but you can kind of get the idea now:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-30 17 23 22](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2047183/80fd3d78-8a16-11e3-9dcc-f076644da5d8.png)\n\nWould love any feedback.\n Some remaining UI tasks:\n- Do something where it's not just a `<ode>` tag with `typography: \"terrible\"`\n- Add timelessness to SpellDebugView for simple values (think a sparkline for numbers)\n- Give SpellDebugView a nicer interface for displaying Thangs (Portraits? full ThangAvatarViews?)\n I agree that it's all about UX testing it. I'm guessing we'll have some different results, because we implemented this for more advanced challenges with more experienced programmers rather than the beginners, since we saw (and you mentioned) that beginners don't take advantage of the debugging tools.\n @nwinter Thanks for tagging these things for me, I'll keep an eye on them as I work on this.\n  If you try to play Rescue Mission (or presumably any level) in Internet Explorer 9, there's only one thing that prevents it from working: there's some bug where goals don't update properly. So when you look at the GoalsView, there appear two copies of each goal, and goals never get fulfilled. When the first goal of getting Tharin out of the dead end can't succeed, then the rest of the scripts don't fire.\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 22 21 16](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1831042/2da6f468-7376-11e3-962b-423a96d92a86.png)\n\nI as of yet have no idea why they don't work. Are they not being sent properly to the World? Are they not triggering in the World? Are they not serializing or deserializing properly? Is the GoalScriptModule not recognizing them? Is there a separate problem with the GoalsView?\n\nIt's probably something tiny and totally stupid.\n @differentmatt remind me of our IE9 status: did we get this one in the last round of IE fixes?\n I didn't see this problem in the last round of IE testing, so we must have fixed the root cause at some point since Jan 1.\n  So now that this is merged in, shall we close this issue and create a new one detailing how to use Validated Backbone Mediator to add all the schemas we'll want?\n Yup! Just need a really good description of the process for Archmages to come in and add schemas.\n  Naw, not code while playing a level (that's data in the LevelSession documents, and those are don't have customizable permissions). This is for in the level editor, and every other editor, and the documents they edit. Every document that has permissions in the database (Level, Article, ThangType, Component, System, etc) has a permissions array property which the owner should be able to edit. Right now the only way to edit permissions is to publish the document, which adds read permissions for 'public'. It should be directly editable so that, for example, one could take a Level (or Article, or ThangType, etc) and set it be read-only by users x, y and z, and writable by users a, b and c, without having to publish it. Does that make sense?\n\nRelated code:\n- [permissions plugin](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/plugins/plugins.coffee#L50) which has a lot of the permissions logic on the server side.\n- [Handler superclass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/commons/Handler.coffee) which uses permissions throughout like for hasAccessToDocument.\n- [LevelSession](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/6009df26de7c7938c0af2122ffba72c07123d172/app/models/LevelSession.coffee) shows how permissions are modified on the client.\n- [CocoModel](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/CocoModel.coffee#L124) shows how permissions are used on the client as well with isPublished and publish.\n  @sderickson I was pointed at [the Backbone Debugger Chrome extension](https://github.com/Maluen/Backbone-Debugger) by @deepak1556, which might be a good place to start with this. What do you think? I tried it and it was able to show views, models, collection, and the router, although its performance exploded when trying to play a level, and it doesn't have any CodeCombat-specific stuff (but we could extend it).\n  Yeah, I added a projection to it recently. I do see the system crash still when trying to load the versions for Brawlwood, complaining that the in-memory sort on the server runs out of memory and dies. So something isn't right about how it's trying to sort. @schmatz @sderickson how can we make [this query](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/commons/Handler.coffee#L121-L132) not explode?\n Use the aggregation framework. The following query works as expected:\n\n```\ndb.levels.aggregate({\n    $match: {\n        \"original\": ObjectId('52d97ecd32362bc86e004e87')\n    }\n}, {\n    $project: {\n        \"name\": 1,\n        \"created\": 1,\n        \"_id\": 0\n    }\n}, {\n    $sort: {\n        \"created\": -1\n    }\n})\n```\n Why yes, yes it did.\n  See #23 for more info on i18n tags. Basically, there's no code for internationalizing [ModalView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/kinds/ModalView.coffee) titles, which are sometimes dynamic, but are usually specified as the `modalTitle` property of ModalView instead of being in the Jade template where we can statically add `data-i18n` attributes. We'll need to add that.\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 17 06 54](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830523/22950eec-734a-11e3-8675-b74082ed94ba.png)\n Good call. @GlenDC is doing this now.\n  This one doesn't take much programming knowledge, just time. I went through most of the highest-use templates and added `data-i18n` attributes so that we could get a first round of localizations done, but I skipped some areas, and a few things have been changed and need new tags. We need to go through the rest of the templates and add the rest of the tags.\n\nHere's an example tag:\n\n``` jade\nh1#site-slogan(data-i18n=\"home.slogan\") Learn to Code JavaScript by Playing a Game\n```\n\nThis then can be translated into various languages in our locale data for, say, Latin American Spanish (es-419):\n\n``` coffee\ntranslation =\n  home:\n    slogan: \"Aprende a programar en JavaScript jugando\"\n    no_ie: \"\u00a1Lo sentimos! CodeCombat no funciona en Internet Explorer 9 o versiones anteriores.\"\n  # ...\n```\n\nAfter which someone can change their language to Spanish and see:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 15 49 08](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830413/619f4dba-733f-11e3-817f-b08757b288b0.png)\n\ninstead of:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 15 48 46](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830414/674a7302-733f-11e3-80cb-016ee25543f0.png)\n\n(We also detect the user's Accept-Language headers to guess their preferred language on first visit instead of always defaulting to English.)\n### The data-i18n attrbiute\n\nLet's take our example:\n\n``` jade\nh1#site-slogan(data-i18n=\"home.slogan\") Learn to Code JavaScript by Playing a Game\n```\n\nThis is a [Jade template](http://jade-lang.com/), so it's just a more concise way to write this HTML:\n\n``` html\n<h1 id=\"site-slogan\" data-i18n=\"home.slogan\">Learn to Code JavaScript by Playing a Game</h1>\n```\n\nAll we need to do is to find elements with text that don't have these `data-i18n` tags and add them. I know there are a lot in the /contribute, /legal, /about, /teachers, and /editor pages. If you want to find more, you can just set your language to Brazilian Portuguese or any other language where we have full coverage and look for things that still show up in English.\n\nSometimes you need to tag a link separately from surrounding text, like in this example:\n\n``` jade\nspan(data-i18n=\"contact.forum_prefix\") For anything public, please try \na(href=\"http://discourse.codecombat.com/\", data-i18n=\"contact.forum_page\") our forum\nspan(data-i18n=\"contact.forum_suffix\")  instead.\n```\n\nI've been adding prefix and suffix tags like that so that the links can be internationalized separately. Note the trailing space in the prefix and the leading space in the suffix: if those weren't there, Jade wouldn't put spaces in between the non-linked text and the link. This is an unsatisfactory approach, because no one who is translating these strings sees those extra bits of whitespace. A better way to do this, where Diplomats don't have to care about whitespace, would be useful.\n\nThe translations themselves are currently going in [app/locale](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale), but hopefully we can just move those to the database soon by doing #22.\n Think just about everything is done now; can re-open if we add a significant amount of new pages, but really we should try to tag new strings as we create them instead of afterward.\n  Shortly after we launched our beta, we had so many amazing [Diplomats](http://codecombat.com/contribute#diplomat) volunteer from across the world to translate CodeCombat into ~20 languages before we could blink. We set up [i18next](http://i18next.com/) to help translate our static text and also added an [InternationalizationNode](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/treema-ext.coffee) to [Treema](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Treema) to help translate strings inside our levels. Cool.\n\nBut where did we put the i18next-based strings? Why, we just hardcoded them into a bunch of CoffeeScript files in [app/locale](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale) and compiled them into the app, of course!\n\nIt's past time for that to change, since I can't keep manually transferring updates for all the languages from [the exploding Google Spreadsheet we used to collect the initial translations](https://docs.google.com/a/codecombat.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjsR1nOoMQ4MdFBqS1NqUmRTVG1hbEMxWTZEd1JrNXc&usp=drive_web#gid=0) into those locale files. Instead, we need:\n1. A way to store each locale in its own MongoDB document, so that a player can load only those translations she needs for her given language.\n2. An interface for Diplomats to use to edit and add translations. Perhaps we can use [i18next-webtranslate](http://i18next.com/pages/ext_webtranslate.html) instead of rolling our own? Otherwise, something involving [Treema](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Treema) would probably make sense.\n See also #65.\n We may end up keeping these in the locale files for easy collaboration with GitHub. Not yet totally decided.\n  It's probably too early to think about how to make it at all fun / playable / performant on mobile devices (since who wants to type code on mobile?), though any steps in that direction will be good. But we should at least be able to pluck some low-hanging fruit for making the rest of the site a bit responsive so that it doesn't look stupid or break when you pull it up on an phone to see what it is.\n\nSo if someone's on top of the latest responsive real-time media query peer-to-peer streaming CSS4 accessible standards-based user-focused design principles and wants to take a crack at improving our layout for mobile, be our guest--we haven't even started, so it's only up from here!\n\n![bad_mobile](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1833989/219eeb72-73d4-11e3-85dd-5f77f2e30b70.png)\n @chloester pointed out that there already are media-query-based grid styles included in our Bootstrap setup, but that they were part of what's broken about the layout as is. (This may be a clue; I'm no media query maestro.)\n I'm tackling this now, let me know if there are any progress/changes I should know about\n  I don't know if this is even possible in the browser, but wouldn't it be cool if we could transform the audio on-the-fly (or maybe once for each sound when loaded) so that in [app/lib/Surface:playScrubbedSounds](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/Surface.coffee), we can play reversed versions of the sounds? Or even fast-forwarded versions depending on the playback speed?\n\nIf anyone knows of a cool way to do this kind of audio processing on the fly performantly, it should be a ton of fun.\n  Defining inner functions within a method is pretty janky and doesn't work very well with Aether's transpilation assumptions, since we can't yield control or instrument execution well within them. It's also not a good way to organize anything, especially within our little spell editor UI.\n\nIt should be possible to just have a \"+\" button somewhere in the Tome interface that lets players define their own spells (methods), which will then be accessible just like any other spell in the Tome. Not sure where we'd put the button yet, but one obvious choice would be at the bottom of the [SpellListView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_list_view.coffee):\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 14 58 04](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830337/25ea74a4-7338-11e3-81ba-8471a6c19936.png)\n\nPerhaps it then opens up a [ModalView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/kinds/ModalView.coffee) asking for the name of the method and which Thang(s) should use it. After the player specifies that, we need to propagate the update across those Programmable Thangs, the [Tome](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Tome), and maybe the LevelSession.\n\nLater we might let players think about saving these methods to their own method library somewhere so they'd be easily accessible in other challenges.\n\n(Originally suggested by @malcolmmcc)\n  One of the reasons that method names are so long (`attackNearbyEnemy`) is that we've always been planning to add really good autocomplete, so that players don't actually have to type that stuff out. I'm not even just talking about tab-completing identifiers, either--that's something that beginners may not know they can do. We could go all out like [jsdares](http://jsdares.com/dare/300000000000000000000000) does and obey the [Victorian commandment to get something on the screen as soon as possible](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/#react):\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 12 43 43](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830140/5fb21312-7325-11e3-8700-4c08e029b852.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 12 47 31](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830146/e930cbec-7325-11e3-9c04-6e10de1606b6.png)\n\n(@janpaul123, you followed the vision--how did that end up working for beginner jsdares players?)\n\nSo how will we do it? There are two parts:\n1. Knowing which completions we could use.\n2. Showing the autocomplete UI.\n\nFor finding completions, our secret weapon will be [Aether](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Thang), since it should know not only which properties are available on `this`, but also through runtime introspection can actually know any property available on anything, what its type is, and what its current value is. I've [opened a related issue over on that project](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/1) to get that part of it ready.\n\nFor autocomplete UI, I hadn't thought too much about it beyond starting with something simple and trying to evolve it toward the screenshots above while iterating through some UX tests. Developing the interface is what this issue (in the main CodeCombat project) is about.\n\nI found a couple potentially useful links for doing autocomplete within ACE:\n- [Codiad's autocomplete](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/blob/master/components/autocomplete/init.js)\n- [A StackOverflow question about it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13545433/autocompletion-in-ace-editor)\n\nI'm guessing we'll probably want something weird enough that we won't really go through ACE for it, though.\n @tips48 has started integrating ACE's new autocomplete to get started, but we'll need a way to feed in the available properties from Aether.\n @tips48 how far did you end up getting with this? Care to share any progress?\n Yeah, it's largely done. I see a few issues remaining with it:\n\n#### 1. Autocomplete often inserts invalid code\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-11 12 57 11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3881890/ba124d3e-2191-11e4-9376-d4e9219a81d6.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-11 12 57 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3881895/c1edcc68-2191-11e4-80ee-e4595d688aea.png)\n\nI should be able to select the autocompletion even after typing this and have it work. It should also do the semicolon for me.\n\n#### 2. Autocomplete requires semi-advanced keypresses\n\nI have to press either tab-tab, down-tab, or down-enter to trigger the first autocomplete snippet. I would prefer it if we can let them also just press tab to do the first one (or even enter if what they have typed couldn't be a valid end of line). Glen mentioned Ctrl+Space\u2013I'm not sure how common that is, but if it's really standard, we might try to support it. I think it will conflict with keyboard input method selection shortcuts a lot of the time, though.\n\n#### 3. Autocomplete z-layering goes above spell palette\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-11 13 00 45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3881936/39d02348-2192-11e4-916f-5051a9e52bce.png)\n\nShould be easy to fix.\n\n#### 4. Autocomplete tries to complete when typing in a comment or string\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-11 13 02 06](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3881948/6aea4364-2192-11e4-91be-8e281b85cf94.png)\n\n#### 5. Autocomplete maybe shouldn't autocomplete numbers\n\n![screenshot 2014-08-11 13 05 12](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3881986/d4e73d6c-2192-11e4-97d1-5acbe1d66b48.png)\n\nWhile it's cool that it can do that, this seems like it would be useful less of the time than it would be confusing.\n\nAt some point soon I think we're going to need to make the snippet insertion much smarter to take advantage of the available methods and only insert valid code (especially on iPad), but we can do that one in a separate issue.\n  Often we do things like link eager players to specific character classes in the /contribute page, like this: **[http://codecombat.com/contribute#artisan](http://codecombat.com/contribute#artisan)**\n\nWhen the page loads, though, the scroll doesn't take account the top bar, so we get the character class title cut off:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 11 12 38](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830031/a61fa89e-7318-11e3-9acf-99112e96e132.png)\n\nIt should instead scroll like this:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 11 16 40](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830043/3a2ed582-7319-11e3-90af-f5b53610d722.png)\n\nWe're already doing something funky with hashes in [app/views/kinds/RootView.coffee](https://github.com/nwinter/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/kinds/RootView.coffee):\n\n``` coffee\n  afterInsert: ->\n    # force the browser to scroll to the hash\n    # also messes with the browser history, so perhaps come up with a better solution\n    super()\n    hash = location.hash\n    location.hash = ''\n    location.hash = hash\n\n    # TODO: automate tabs to put in hashes and navigate to them here\n```\n\nI wonder if this should be fixed on the HTML/CSS side, or if we should just add more code in `afterInsert` to take the top bar height into account.\n  Specific articles are still there (even with tabs when multiple), but general articles aren't. Haven't dug in; wonder if this has something to do with any recent changes to supermodel fetching of Article models?\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 11 10 01](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830028/51a16c6c-7318-11e3-92e7-2cf32c8e23ff.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 11 09 25](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830025/33772330-7318-11e3-89ba-156d3f30c421.png)\n  ![screenshot 2014-01-01 10 55 48](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829997/917ac5ba-7316-11e3-975a-ece1c783491c.png)\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 10 58 09](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830000/c6e2006a-7316-11e3-83aa-6e0a40f25f01.png)\n\nIn UX testing, in support chats, everywhere--no one sees or thinks to click that Guide button. We've tried saying \"Check the Guide\" in the default code comments, which helps a little, but players still don't usually notice that, so more is needed. @sderickson 's ideas:\n- Have the guide glow after 5 or 10 minutes of gameplay and no win condition or script triggering\n- Put together a player's guide that we link to prominently from the home page which goes over tips for how to get through a level (like playing multiplayer, or reading the guide carefully, or checking on the forum).\n\nI thought some sort of redesign of the button itself might be in order. Maybe the word \"Guide\" isn't right. Maybe we need to make the first three levels' scripts need to put the big red arrow on it and tell them to click it for more info, which might at least get players playing through in order into the habit.\n\n**Related files:**\n- [app/templates/play/level/control_bar.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/level/control_bar.jade)\n- [app/styles/play/level/control_bar.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level/control_bar.sass)\n- [app/styles/play/level.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level.sass) (the banner-button base styles)\n We made the button green, and we also have it show up when the level is still loading if the level is set to do so. Probably not enough yet.\n Let's see how this works\u2013it highlights the Guide button every 5 minutes, until you click it. Further improvement might be persisting this to know whether they have ever clicked it, not just in this session of this level.\n  ![screenshot 2014-01-01 10 32 02](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829953/2450f55c-7313-11e3-889a-8c4dde1d42bd.png)\n\nSometimes you want to grab some `(x, y)` coordinates, so we built this stopgap [app/lib/surface/CoordinateDisplay.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CoordinateDisplay.coffee) for displaying them on cursor hover after a slight delay. It's pretty bad, though:\n1. It's not visible enough--players often miss it even when looking for it, and it's hard to see even when you know it's there.\n2. It's so ugly, and usually not used, that you wouldn't want to just make it much bigger or something.\n3. You have to leave your cursor hovered over the map while you type the coordinates into the spell editor, and you're out of luck if you ever click anything (since units will deselect or the map will pan).\n\n@chloester suggested having a waving flag where you click down and every time you click to a different place, it keeps the coordinate, with a background bubble/pin. @sderickson was thinking that it'd be a button you'd press to activate the tool, and then the next point you clicked would get inserted into the editor. I tried out adding a grid, so you could just read coordinates by following the major tick lines, and that's in, but the initial grid design sucked:\n\n![screenshot 2014-01-01 10 45 27](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829969/dcd601a2-7314-11e3-8dba-9af0188db77e.png)\n\nIt needs the numbers to go onto the Screen Layer but the grid lines to either stay on the Surface Layer or to also be on the Screen Layer but change whenever the viewport changes. [More on Layers here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Surface). Maybe if we improve the CoordinateDisplay enough, we can just get rid of the grid?\n We could try to detect when a coordinate is required in the code, but it probably won't work very well until we get through our other backlog of bugs with the smart features of the spell editor. Might be worth a shot, though.\n\nThe level editor's scripts preview coordinate picker uses shift+click to select a point. We could have a script fire in any of the intros that try to teach the coordinates to say, \"Shift+click a place on the map to insert the coordinate\", and when you press shift, your cursors changes and the coordinate display gets emphatic. Not sure if that's a valid enough use of the shift+click, but we aren't using it yet.\n Try using the [Backbone.Mediator events](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Events%2C-subscriptions%2C-shortcuts) to pass the information around.\n The shortcut is in! Now we need to mod some tutorial scripts (I'm thinking the Brawlwood tutorial to start off) to point out that you can shift+click to grab coordinates and see how users respond when playtesting.\n Updated the styles here on suggestion of another user somewhen:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-28 11 56 01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/2553881/9d88a96c-b6aa-11e3-9c2b-6fe621836ded.png)\n\nAlso noted that you can use the shift+click in a few tutorial comments and in the loading tips.\n  [Aether](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Aether) can (in some levels) highlight the currently executing line, as well as indicating which lines have been executed already:\n\n![screenshot 2013-12-31 19 43 39](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829286/f301a36a-7296-11e3-80a3-06d3009c6714.png)\n\nSee the black gutter arrow and light blue highlight on line five, and the lighter blue highlight on line three? Really? You're the only one.\n\nIn our UX testing, players almost never see this even when it would be really helpful, so it's clearly not obvious enough. Also, I just made up the design as a placeholder, but I didn't make it ugly enough to warrant immediate redesign, so no one has come along to do a better job. If you have an idea for a design that meets these objectives, then let's hear it:\n1. It should be totally obvious which line is currently executing.\n2. It should be clear that that's what the indicator is trying to indicate.\n3. We should be able to indicate which statements have already executed (not just lines, since we can be more specific than that).\n4. It looks cool. (Wizardly magic animation?!)\n\nCurrently, we're using dynamic marker ranges in [ACE](http://ace.c9.io/) to add `\"executing\"` or `\"executed\"` classes to spans of text (stacking up to three of the `\"executed\"` markers to indicate multiple executions), as well as adding the `\"executing\"` class to the gutter cell for the current line:\n\n![screenshot 2013-12-31 19 51 29](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829297/f752c416-7297-11e3-9eb6-1c38e5856a9b.png)\n\n![screenshot 2013-12-31 19 49 46](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829296/cfc57286-7297-11e3-9a7e-db99ac46651d.png)\n\nWe could get more complicated if this CSS doesn't cut it, but if you have an idea that can be done just by tweaking the effects of those classes, then it'll be easy to try out by tweaking [app/styles/play/level/tome/spell.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/level/tome/spell.sass)\n\nOtherwise, check out how the ranges are done in [app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee:highlightCurrentLine](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/spell_view.coffee).\n Hmm, one thing that comes to mind is that we often show current statement execution for several different statements within the same line, not for the same line all by itself. So the background highlight probably shouldn't be for the whole line there, but rather just the currently executing statement. I wonder if the green striped design will be as clear with less contrast if it isn't always connected to the gutter arrow?\n\nI kind of like the checkmarks on the side (but I'm no designer). We could merge that in and start UX-testing it to see how it goes.\n Comments won't ever be currently executing, though, so that would be okay. Want to submit a pull request and we can start trying it out?\n I like the improved contrast at `0.35` opacity, but at least to my eye, I want it to go way up, to something like `0.65`:\n\n![screenshot 2014-03-13 18 09 46](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/2417114/1cb4d6d4-ab16-11e3-84bd-4bd6c185b625.png)\n\nThoughts?\n Ah, the curse of different colors on different screens. We could also try changing the `this` color to something else? I can't see the problem on any of my three screens with my two eyes, but my eyes aren't the best at colors.\n I've got the brighter green and the light red in. I can't see the red at all compared to black 'cause I'm colorblind, but whatever, the contrast is there.\n  ![screenshot 2013-12-31 19 35 07](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829278/b4cc2f3a-7295-11e3-884e-a8e48a146ce1.png)\n\nThe HUDView uses a DialogueAnimator to animate script dialogue messages in one character at a time while preserving HTML elements. However, it's really inefficient, and when the framerate is low for some reason, it can take a really long time time for the DialogueAnimator to complete (which then makes players wait a long time to go onto the next script on slow computers).\n\nWe should make the dialogue animation speed independent of any lag or dropped frames from the rest of the interface being slow, and we should probably profile it to make sure that it isn't contributing to any slowness itself.\n\n@sderickson Did you have any ideas on a better implementation?\n\n**Related files:**\n- [app/views/play/level/dialogue_animator.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/dialogue_animator.coffee)\n- [app/views/play/level/hud_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/hud_view.coffee)\n  I'll this done along with the rest of the database upgrades/changes.\n  This is an old issue that has taken care of itself. Glen is now making a Windows install script, and many people have used the Linux and Mac scripts successfully. \n  @karthigb, we just got the art for it\u2013if someone wants to put it in, then the first issue can be closed! Want to finish it off?\n\nThe 404 images are in app/assets/images/pages/not_found. There are three of them. The app/views/not_found.coffee should randomly pick one of them and display it in the 404 template at app/templates/not_found.jade. Any additional styling can be done in app/styles/not_found.sass, which doesn't exist yet but could be added.\n Fixed from #460!\n", "text_all_count": 90807, "text_word_token": ["Same", "as", "NUMBER",

We should just always set the camera to zoom all the way out in Spectate mode.\n\nCan you link to a couple replays that time out that shouldn't? Is it a case of the hero's code not running, or the heroes do fight and die but the Spectate doesn't properly assign victory?\n  Thought I got all these with the patches from Harry the Wanderer, but possibly something caused those patches to not apply properly in these levels.\n The fixes are in and waiting for approval - what is the flow after that? Merged 'em in!  Hi, this is my first translation on CodeCombat so please comment if you find any issues.\r\n\r\nAlso I have few questions:\r\n- **line 236 (school_name_placeholder)** - not sure if it's allowed to enter addresses in Cyrillic or users should use transliteration instead.\r\n- **line 650 (payment_methods_blurb1)** - I improved old translation to include note about PayPal (as it is here https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/en.coffee#L650) but not sure if that is the best way here. Maybe such things (e.g. messages related to payments which include hardcoded emails or etc) better to leave in English? Values can change in future and if not updated in all the languages immediately - people might pay something incorrectly... Maybe better to write something like \"If you want to pay using PayPal - write us and we will tell you how to do that\".

Discussed issues are [here](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues).\n\nThere's also a survey that's relevant to you: [Survey for devs/teams with maintained Coffescript codebases: happy with CS, or considering migrating?](https://github.com/coffeescript6/discuss/issues/32)\n @nwinter thanks! Do you know of any other teams with big maintained Coffeescript codebases? I'd like to make them aware of the survey. CodeCombat was the first big team/project I thought of.\n  Hello,\n\nI can't copy or paste code in CodeCombat. Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V doesn't do anything, neither does selecting the commands from the right click drop down menu. I've arrived at the mountain levels now, and I have to type more and more code, and it is getting more and more frustrating to have to type the same lines of code over and over again all the time.\nI am using Firefox. Strangely, copypasting does work in Chrome, but I can't play in Chrome because CodeCombat always causes it to crash after about five minutes, likely because of another unrelated issue.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this problem and if so, how can I solve it?\n\nThanks in advance.\n I use Windows. As far as I can see, this happens only in the code window, I haven't seen it happen anywhere else.\nSlight correction: pasting does seem to work in the code window now, it is copying that doesn't work. When I copy something from the code window and try to paste it in Notepad++ for example, I get a little black box with \"SOH\" in it, which is a control character in Notepad.\n Hello,\n\nI've solved this issue, it turned out that Firefox cannot copy or paste text written in the Ace code editor that codecombat uses. This can be solved by changing \"dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled\" \"to \"True\" in the about:config settings of Firefox.\n   Sure. I just saw it there without being used and thought it was obsolete.\n  I was messing around, figuring out how the site works, I completed the first level of Campain Game dev in Python, then switched languages to Javascript and now level two does not work. The linter says incorrect first argument `game.spawnHeroXY(5, 8);` and that the first argument should be either `[\"spawn\"],[\"hear\"],[\"update\"],[\"click\"]` but as far as I can tell the code is correct. I did not change anything, and the instructions say that you don't have to, so everything should work. \n Sorry about that! We recently made some changes to prepare for future game dev levels that may be causing this error. Try clearing your browser cache to see if that clears things up?\n\nIf that doesn't work, try logging in to direct.codecombat.com, see if it works there?\n  A student was able to go from the forest to the glacier by typing in the name of a level, which allowed the gray banner to show up, seeming as if they got there.\n  - Clients check updated achievements as well as new ones\n- Clients do not wait to keep checking\n- Update achievement points along with everything else in EarnedAchievement.upsertFor\n- Fix various bugs\n  The array built at the beginning named fieldMap is uneditable, and even copying it to another array still locks it.  I'm trying to edit values within the array, and no error message pops up, but trying the exact same commands with a custom-made array of the same name confirms the fieldMap array is uneditable.\n\n```\n>>>>fieldMap[0][1] -> 'x' # value starts as x\nfieldMap[0][1] = '.' # change value to .\n>>>>fieldMap[0][1] -> 'x' # value is still x\nmap2 = fieldMap\n>>>>map2[0][1] -> 'x'\nmap2[0][1] = '.'\n>>>>map2[0][1] -> 'x'\n```\n Yes, because is a protected property.\n`map2 = fieldMap` -- it's not a copy, it's a reference.\nTo make a copy you need use other methods.\n @nwinter You are right - it's not a property. `fieldMap` is the result of the unit's custom method `getMap()`. So I'm not sure it's a referee bug or the interpreter.\n Oh! Stupid me. @Kevitto you can't change lines of the array because they are strings and immutable. @nwinter should be an error in this case? If yes, then I think it's an editor/interpreter bug.\n  - Clients check updated achievements as well as new ones\n- Clients do not wait to keep checking\n By the way, does this fix #3214?\n It should, once it's fully deployed.

If you can figure out what line it should be on, great; if not, maybe we can put `\"Previous run: \"` instead of `\"Line X: \"`?\n I think it looks good, s'long's it still feels good (I didn't run it). `problem.message` should be fine because we only now have one method and one Thang (except in multiplayer where there is also `Hero Placeholder 1`, but I think another mechanism should suffice to prevent those errors from getting into the wrong hero. May be worth a quick manual check, though.)\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n  Code looks good to me\n  The comments in this one are showing the comment's name, not value:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21039201/17670308/5f9fcfe8-62df-11e6-96e9-ecd3c10c4bfc.png)\n  The units on wave 4's pathing puts three (3) units within range of the explosion instead of two (2), leading to the third unit always dying.  \n\nThe code does not let me add a third target to the shielding mechanic, therefore always losing the battle.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21039201/17666605/f2b9bd36-62ce-11e6-9e2e-5f216d534b55.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21039201/17666592/dd5fa1bc-62ce-11e6-8a43-9986d74efadc.png)\n Sorry, I have no idea how to do any of that.

Jasmine provides a [clock you can manipulate](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html#section-Jasmine_Clock), so you could give a SuperModel a resource to load, tick the clock manually, then assert that it created another request.\n Checking out the logs on Travis, looks like the retry logic is firing when tests generate requests but do not fulfill them. Should figure out a way to clear them after each test. One possibility: when `testing`, keep an array of created timeouts on the SuperModel and clear them `afterEach` test.\n I saw another sometimes-error on another RequestQuoteView test that uses `_.defer` to wait for the SuperModel to load.

Need to fix the simulation system to not attempt to rank private sessions (where `multiplayer` is false).\n I think I fixed this in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/bfa49cbbc6fc7eaa0d04fb56d19cab16232ded00 although it's not deployed yet, should be later today. The simulator will now add `submitted` to its projection, which checks the permission properly.\n  ...but it works fine in Chrome. Please read this thread:\nhttps://discourse.codecombat.com/t/recommendation-differentiate-the-multiplayer-levels-so-they-stand-out-on-the-game-board/8236/3\n The particles are intentionally disabled in non-Chrome browsers, as you can see [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/5dd4db7676b77fd660251563688b6d1938de86d5/app/views/play/CampaignView.coffee#L395).\nThis patch has been introduced [over a year ago](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/77bca720023d3d859cdebf71b9e7fab2a86cb460) by @nwinter. I have no idea why it is like this. I've just removed the `and $.browser.chrome` part and the particles effect works nicely in Firefox/Win10, at least.\n Well, if it's intentianally disabled, then there could be some other differentiation to clear the situation, e.g.:\n- use a different design for those flags (e.g. with crossed swords, as suggested in the thread)\n- or use a different color\n It was intentionally disabled, but that was a long time ago and the reasoning is unclear. Perhaps it was due to a browser bug or third-party library compatibility issue that has already been fixed. I'd suggest to re-enable the particles effect and see if it is still an issue.\n I have some ~5 years old PC/Mac, but their specs are still pretty decent, so I guess it doesn't count. I assume you meant low-end machines. \ud83d\ude1b \n So, if performance is an issue, how about some static differentiation, as mentioned above?\n New art was deployed sometime ago, things are more clear this way.

As part of my current research, I'm studying the implications of open-sourcing a proprietary software, for instance, if the project succeed in attracting newcomers. However, I observed that some projects, like codecombat, deleted the software history during the transition to open-source.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/6009df26de7c7938c0af2122ffba72c07123d172\n\nKnowing that software history is indispensable for developers (e.g., developers need to refer to history several times a day), I would like to ask codecombat developers the following four brief questions:\n1. Why did you decide to not keep the software history?\n2. Do the core developers faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?\n3. Do the newcomers faced any kind of problems, when trying to refer to the old history? If so, how did they solve these problems?\n4. How does the lack of history impacted on software evolution? Does it placed any burden in understanding and evolving the software?\n\nThanks in advance for your collaboration,\n\nGustavo Pinto, PhD\nhttp://www.gustavopinto.org\n  I was looking for a circular logo for CC, and I couldn't find one, so I edited the logo_square_250.\n  UX update\n  Update classroom and gameplay Ux to surface practice levels as 3a, 3b,\netc.\nUpdate next level logic to leverage practice levels based on per level\ncompletion playtime thresholds.\nPatrol buster and patrol buster A are live for testing.\nFix a few classroom Ux progress hover bubble info bugs.\n  I translated some of the words and quotes to Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l) and also\nmade some changes to some of them that were already translated\n It is now done\n   Fixed in c3ed217.\n    Ref: #3729\n\n`<button>`s are `type=\"submit\"` by default.\n Looks like this will be no longer relevant once #3756 is merged, but oh well. Merge this if you want to deploy a fix before the new account modal is merged in.\n  Hey guys,\nAfter making a fair bit of progress the other day, I came back to the site to continue my adventures and chose a new level to work on.\n\nAs soon as I hit _Run_ to start testing, I got an error:\n**Line 3: TypeError: Generator is already running**\n\nThe error is showing up on the opening line of the usual `while (true) {}` loop, and is gating me from playing any more levels (it happens on every level I try to play, but if I switch to Python, I can complete the level that way. It seems to be directly related to javascript somehow).\n\nHere's an example of my code from the [Sarven Sentry](https://codecombat.com/play/level/sarven-sentry) level:\n\n```\n// Use different colored flags to perform different tasks.\n\nwhile(true) {\n    var anyFlag = hero.findFlag();\n    var flagGreen = hero.findFlag(\"green\");\n    var flagBlack = hero.findFlag(\"black\");\n\n    // If there's a flagGreen...\n    if (flagGreen) {\n        hero.buildXY(\"fence\", flagGreen.pos.x, flagGreen.pos.y);\n    } else if (flagBlack) {\n        hero.buildXY(\"fire-trap\", flagBlack.pos.x, flagBlack.pos.x);\n    }\n    hero.pickUpFlag(anyFlag);\n    // Move back to the center.\n    hero.moveXY(43, 31);\n}\n```\n\nThis is all while running in Chrome Version 53.0.2774.3 dev (64-bit) on a Macbook Pro.\n\nLet me know if there's any more info I can offer; I'm dying to get back to killing ogres!\n\n![sarven_sentry](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3085463/16350052/2661cd54-3a11-11e6-9c62-8a74b51e2d0f.jpg)\n This is almost certainly related to switching esper to use modern javascript.  I cant reproduce this on mainline chrome (51.0.2704.84) or Canary (53.0.2777.0).\n\nCan you  try pointing your browser at this page and let me know if all the tests pass?\n\nhttp://esper.chessgears.com/test-modern\n Haha, ouch:\n\npasses: 21\n**failures: 510**\nduration: 3.51s\n\nSounds like you think it might be one of my flags or something similar, yeah? I'll give it a check and report back...\n\n_Edit_\nYep, switched back to the stable channel (Version 51.0.2704.106) and all tests are now passing. The game is now running properly again. Awesome; thanks for the help!\n I can reproduce it on Chrome version 51.0.2704.103 m (64-bit). No fancies enabled / vanilla. Everywhere those : 'TypeError: Generator is already running' on your test page. updated to Chrome version 51.0.2704.106 m (64-bit) - still no do.\n I just upgraded to 51.0.2704.103 (Official Build) (64-bit) but still cant reproduce. Could the 'm' from the multi-installer make a difference here?\n Getting the Error too (on any level using loops ...)\n`TypeError: Generator is already running`\non OSX Chrome 52.0.2743.82 (64-bit).\n\nWorks fine in Firefox 49.0a2 (2016-07-20)\n 'm' does not seem to be the problem, if it happens on OSX, too.\nUpdated to \"52.0.2743.82 m (64-bit)\", problem persists. I am playing it in Opera now :)\n ^ RoboTeddy reporting in with more info.\n\nhttp://esper.chessgears.com/test-modern passes 21 and fails 518 with a bunch of \"Generator is already running\" messages on my Google Chrome 52.0.2743.82 64-bit on OSX 10.11.1\n\nLet me know if there's anything I can do to help debug.\n The #enable-javascript-harmony chrome flag seems to be the problem. Credit goes to https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9372#issuecomment-228852346 .\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI've added the following test to my project, if it throws an error I load ES5 code instead of ES6:\n\n``` javascript\n(function(){\n  'use strict';\n  eval('function out(){} (function*(){return out();})().next().done');\n})();\n```\n\nThe `'use strict';` bit is important, it only fails in strict mode. Credit goes to the same source.\n My guess is that an `async` function (transformed by babel's `transform-async-to-generator`) is returning a Promise. That does not work in Chrome. E.g.\n\n``` javascript\n// does not work in chrome\nasync () => {\n  let value = await asynchronousFunction();\n  return promiseReturningFunction(value);\n}\n```\n\nDo this instead:\n\n``` javascript\nasync () => {\n  let value = await asynchronousFunction();\n  return await promiseReturningFunction(value);\n}\n```\n That sounds like either a babel bug or a misunderstanding.\n\n`return await` seems to be necessary even when returning the result of a synchronous function if `await` was used at any point in the function.\n Esper doesn't use any async functions, only generator functions.\n\nI'll add the code at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9372 into the ES6 detection function.  The current function is here: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/workers/worker_world.js#L69\n  \ud83d\udc4d \n Client tests need updating maybe?

A lot of these can probably apply to ES-Spanish as well, but I only worked on this one today.

Thanks for reporting this!\n        -Translated new lines, fixed a few writing mistakes\n-Section about Payments is written in formal second-person, but i can change it to second-person singular as the other sections are written like that. \n\n-Prevedene nove stvari, par gre\u0161aka u pisanju ispravljeno\n-Sekcija o uplatama je pisana u 2. licu mno\u017eine (formalno), mada mogu prepraviti na 2. lice jednine, kao i za ostale sekcije \u0161to je pisano ranije\n  Translate nav module\n      Some links have vanished from the account navigation since the last update:\n![](http://i.imgur.com/WFPyZeK.png)\n\nParticularly, I can't seem to find the regular campaign's subscription page (`/account/subscription`), nor the prepaid coupons, and maybe there are more navigation items missing that I don't recall as well.\n\nI'm not sure if this is related to my user being in a course or not.\n Yes, this is related to being marked a 'student'. Users who are part of a course are considered students, and so don't need easy access to these links.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/base-flat.jade#L1-L16\n\nThese pages can be accessed through Settings -> [Account](http://codecombat.com/account), instead.\n\nClosing this issue, since the changes were intentional.\n Makes sense. I agree those navigation links as they stood could be more confusing than helpful to course students.\n\nThough, I'll note that the `/account` page is extremely hard to get to, I've only found a link to it from the breadcrumbs.\n\nIn any case, campaign players can get to the subscription modal easily by clicking on a subscriber-only level, so that isn't really a problem. Though, now I wonder if a course student who is also subscribed to the campaign mode wants to cancel their subscription, that might be very hard (or nearly impossible) to do without the navigation link, right?\n\nWould a patch to display the subscription page link when the student is subscribed to the campaign be welcome? Basically, I'm suggesting to add a `&& !isSubscribed()`'ish to [this line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/f44f201548b7d2a84391ac3ce816c7a8c9819679/app/templates/base-flat.jade#L9).\n Nice!

Please add this strings soon. Thanks a lot\n I just did, thank you.\n  This addresses 5 out of the 7 tasks on the following issue: [Add item selling](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/2625)\n\nThe tasks that have been completed are as follows:\n- Decide on a buyback percentage\n- Add sell button UI\n- Add buy back price\n- Add model logic for tracking sold items, total gems now including sales, etc.\n- Making certain items (awarded items?) unsellable (I set the foundation for this. Currently, items that have a gem price of 0 are unsellable)\n\nI'm not sure why my GitHub authentication commits are showing up, but it doesn't have them listed under the changed files.\n I think we can get away with a simpler system for sales, from the backend. We built the purchase system more complicated than we needed to begin with... Instead of this sales infrastructure, could you add two endpoints: `POST /db/user/:handle/sold` and `DELETE/db/user/:handle/sold`, which would add/remove (sell/buyback) a purchased or earned item from a similarly structured sold structure and update the user accordingly at the same time with a mongodb update. No Sale collection or handler required in that case.\n\nThis would also be easier to do with our new server system which uses generators and also express the way it was meant to be used, and luckily there are already a couple endpoints which are pretty similar! See how adding and removing watchers from articles works:\n\n[Routes](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/defade9824201f2cbe62b7f5bcdd5934daf968a4/server/routes/index.coffee#L17-L18)\n[Middleware](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/middleware/patchable.coffee#L31-L53)\n[Tests](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/defade9824201f2cbe62b7f5bcdd5934daf968a4/spec/server/functional/article.spec.coffee#L619-L679)\n\nThis is a new server system, and soon I'll [add a recipes for it](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Cookbook), but in the meantime check out these pages if you're curious how generators work.\n\n[Iterators and generators (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)\n[Node.js Flow (part 2) - Fibers and Generators](http://blog.vullum.io/nodejs-javascript-flow-fibers-generators/)\n\nOr text me in the general slack room and I can give some tips! This upcoming server structure will be much more transparent in how things work, and I'll be interested to hear what you think of it.\n Thank you for the feedback! This new server system looks a lot more intuitive and transparent from my initial impressions. It might be a couple of days before I can get to making these changes. Thank you for the detailed information; I'll definitely let you know how it goes!\n No problem. I'll give some more comments on this PR in the near future for the client side as well, but from a cursory scan it looks good!\n   Oops, someone already got this :)\n  Made an attempt at issue #3413 .\n\nLet me know if any refactoring or other changes are necessary.\n\nCreated an new_home in the en.coffee to add the tags, since I wasn't sure where else to place them.\n Ah sorry @Imperadeiro98 , should be alright now\n    Thanks!\n\nBy the way, I'm working on creating a [CodeCombat Cookbook](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Cookbook), and this morning I added a recipe for [Translating page strings](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Translate-page-strings). I added the guideline to mark strings with DNT to avoid this problem in the future. Also, can you look over the recipe and let me know if I missed anything for good translation rules?\n  Looked through the code and couldn't find any left. Client tests always fail on Travis right now, but running them locally where they should all still work, a couple of them fail for the LevelLoader. Please fix these tests first. To run them, see [the instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Testing). Thanks!\n Now's the time to get some experience! ;) They're there to make it so all developers working on the project can easily debug their changes, and it's not surprising these wide-ranging changes would cause a few. All you have to do is navigate to [http://localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test), click a broken test, then debug as is normal in programming. The page will refresh with every change you make, automatically running any changes you make or displaying the logs you add to the affected area. Give it a try! If it gives you guff, let me know, I want to make testing as easy, painless and useful as possible.\n What happens if you undo the changes to SuperModel and LevelLoader? Do the broken LevelLoader tests pass then?\n Yeah, I think that's going to take more effort to migrate properly. Let's just get the rest of those changes incorporated. Thanks!\n  This seems to occur when the view port is too small, so that not all of the tabs can fit on a single screen.  \n Hrm, I only see it occurring in viewports <1200px wide. Could you provide a whole-window screenshot of it happening at a higher resolution? And verify that the zoom level is at 100%?\n Interesting, looks like select menus render larger on windows. (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22844493/width-of-select-list-in-windows-wider-than-mac)\n\nWe can kind of fix this on large screens by adding by adding a `max-width: 190px` to the select, but it still happens on smaller screens before it collapses the menu to a hamburger.\n\n<img width=\"804\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-02-20 at 1 18 42 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/491376/13199230/7ce9344a-d7d4-11e5-8f28-95812b589f0b.png\">\n<img width=\"1031\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-02-20 at 1 18 59 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/491376/13199233/873ca7e2-d7d4-11e5-897e-ed7320588d2b.png\">\n\nExactly 768px wide in particular has some weird behavior.

I've tried with no input fields filled in (which gives me the \"required fields not entered\" error) and with sane inputs (which passed correctly).

I had to upgrade v2.3 to v.2.5 Graph FB API on my project.\nAnd in new version https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=... does not return email by default. You have to specify required user data explicitly:\nhttps://graph.facebook.com/v2.5/me?fields=email,first_name,last_name&access_token=...\nMaybe that helps.\n See example here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/reference/FB.api\nIt looks like you have to change line 42 in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/core/social-handlers/FacebookHandler.coffee\n\n``` javascript\n  fetchMeForLogin: ->\n    FB.api('/me', @onReceiveMeInfo)\n```\n\nto\n\n``` javascript\n  fetchMeForLogin: ->\n    FB.api('/me', {fields: 'email,last_name,first_name,gender'}, @onReceiveMeInfo)\n```\n Better now?\n I see your changes but still the same error on line 46 :(\nMaybe you can add debug info what we get in r after calling FB.api('/me')?\n One tester was able to log in with FB; haven't heard other bug reports of it. I wonder if there still might be something specific to your configuration. Anyone else having issues with this?\n @sderickson any ideas why FB wouldn't be giving us the email properly for a small subset of users?\n I think the best bet would be to console.debug the response, as @vzverev78 suggested, it might have an error attached to it that would explain what's going on.\n\nI also wonder what would happen if you log in in incognito mode.

If you load a level from the map (as opposed to loading it directly from url), it looks like the other heroes are getting pulled into [thangTypes](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/Level.coffee#L31) that I'm guessing aren't supposed to be. I'll figure it out... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\n\nThe [serialize](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/Level.coffee#L15-L35) function is also running 2x on every level load, but I think that's a separate issue.\n Yeah, probably something with the projections of the heroes from the PlayHeroesView getting in there. Maybe we can load those separately or fix whatever that `notInLevel` part is supposed to be doing.\n\nI wonder if we can get `serialize` to only run once; that takes a while, so could be hurting performance if we don't need to do it a second time.\n  Updates on French locale file\nI want to see what Clans et Courses are like before I translate their entries.\n\nAjouts d'entr\u00e9es FR\nIl reste les entr\u00e9es Courses et Clans, o\u00f9 je voudrais voir \u00e0 quoi \u00e7a ressemble avant de trouver les traductions.\n Hi, @Imperadeiro98 !

I walked through the [Dev Setup: Linux](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup%3A-Linux) section on a VM running 64-bit Ubuntu Server 15.10, ran into issues below and worked through them:\n1. Install mongodb instead of mongoldb-org\n2. The version of NodeJS installed by OS is too old; resort to using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install version 4.2.2 of NodeJS.\n3. Run `sudo service mongodb start` (because of  item 1)\n\nThen, after I executed `nom run dev` or `nom start`, I was able to bring the the CodeCombat home page locally as well as creating a new account.\n\nBut when I click on \"Play\", all the lands are greyed out.  I am unable choose a hero nor play any level.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\n![codecombat-local-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95088/11464597/6defc6b4-96e5-11e5-8cc4-0d53a9df711a.png)\n![codecombat-local-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/95088/11464607/9c64db6a-96e5-11e5-9290-7d932aa5aea4.png)\n  Whenever I try to start the dev server, it throws an ENOENT error. I tracked it down to Brunch not finding `nodemon`.\n\nYou guys that are running the dev server (`npm run dev`) on a Linux/Mac setup, do you have nodemon on your `$PATH` (check with `which nodemon`)? If not, then Brunch is working as expected and I'm facing a more specific issue (perhaps: [child_process.spawn ignores PATHEXT on Windows](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/2318)).\n\nIf you **_do**_ have nodemon in your `$PATH`, then it should probably be documented in the Wiki and added to the vagrant setup's provisioner shell.\n Thanks for testing. I've just tested on OS X and `npm run dev` is working even without nodemon in the `$PATH` as well.\n\nSo this is a Windows-specific issue. I should be able to submit a fix later tonight.\n  The \"Completed 10 Basic Syntax Levels\" achievement is not getting unlocked for me:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7b8Vsxh.png)\n\nI had already completed 10 basic syntax levels before this achievement was created, perhaps that is related to the issue. I've tried resubmitting a basic syntax level solution and the achievement still did not unlock.\n I'm having the same issue, however my screenshot makes it look hilarious because I've just earned the 50 syntax levels achievement.\nI'm learning Python, on Google Chrome, in Linux Mint 17.2 Rafaela.\n![bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15007314/11457173/a2986ab6-9667-11e5-8c91-647b4b2fdd2e.png)\n I just got this achievement.I'm learning python, on Chrome,  in Windows 8.\n![complete 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14168678/11461704/7f537db0-96bd-11e5-8724-be2712eb5dcc.png)\n So it seems this is a problem only for those that had already completed the given number of basic syntax levels before the achievement was added to the game.\n Looks like @nwinter made a [migration script](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/9d21f87345e20e07742ced8e9de09742276c4562), so I'm assuming this will be fixed in the next deploy.\n The same problem now happens for \"Completed 5 Arrays Levels\", \"Completed 5 Object Literals Levels\", \"Completed 2 Vectors Levels\" and that whole class of achievements.\n\nSeems like old accounts are missing a lot of XP and gems due to that.\n Same here: I basically completed every level available (and even more) in CodeCombat, but I'm missing these basic achievements:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12795864/13074910/e41ca2f8-d4a7-11e5-9ac2-786787f1a8ef.png)\n\n---\n\nBut there is something wrong with the multiplayer achievements too, as I already [mentioned on slack](https://codecombat.slack.com/archives/general/p1454579097000325): beating an AI player does not unlock the relevant achievement.\n\nRelated to that, I copy - once again - my comment from #1957:\n\n> I suggest that all players (no matter when they submitted their code) should be matched (at least 2-5 times) against all AI levels to have a chance for getting the achievements.\n @anter69 As for the AI achievements, I believe the plan is to improve the UI to make it easier to select an AI opponent to fight against, and then improve the AI achievements system to unlock these achievements when synchronously fighting an AI (i.e. at the moment you play against an AI and submit winning code). You can see more of this discussion in #3241, though we should perhaps open a more focused thread.\n This might be a good enhancement, but it seems to be a lot of work -- which could be avoided if the matching script would simply check any and all solutions against the AIs (unless the player already beat them):\n\n``` py\nif player.achievement(\"Beat simple AI\") == False and \"simple AI\" not in player.opponentsList:\n   nextOpponent = \"simple AI\"\n```\n\n(I'm totally unfamiliar with the underlying code, obviously)\n Yeah, I guess that would be an improvement to the simulations matching logic.\n\nAlso, I believe the achievement could be unlocked both ways\u2014through sync and async simulations. It is a pretty bad user experience to beat an AI in the synchronous simulation and not get the achievement for it. Perhaps this is not so much work, as it seems the synchronous simulation already unlocks the achievement for the Simple AI, and Nick has stated that the team has been working on improving the multiplayer UI, so maybe they get to improve the opponent selection as well.\n\nAgain, though, it should be better to discuss this in #3241 or a new dedicated issue. We are only scattering this topic across several threads which makes it harder to track, and derailing this thread which should be about backfilling newly created achievements.\n Hey people, any updates here? Any way I can help?\n\nIn any case, I have some suggestions for possible solutions:\n- Run a script every 24 hours or so (like a cron job or a similar `setInterval` logic) that syncs up the achievements. In order to avoid overloading the server, this process should only run for \"active\" users (users that have logged in in the last 48 hours?) and be processed in batches (200~2,000 users at time?).\n- Add a \"Refresh\" button to the Achievements modal that sends an API call to recalculate the achievements for the logged-in user. This API should be rate-limited in order to avoid abuse/DoS, of course.\n\nLet me know if any of these suggestions sound good, and I may start working on them if I have time. Note that these suggestions would not only fix this specific issue (#3214), but also any problems related to creating new achievements or adding concepts to existing levels (#3240).\n I guess that achievements are currently checked and awarded when you successfully finish (submit) a level _for the first time_. So, why not remove the \"first time only\" restriction? That would require minimal changes, and would probably not need much extra resources either. Obviously, players would need to resubmit a few levels, but that's not much of an effort for the extra gems + xp...\n @anter69 Seems like you are assuming that when you complete a level, the system queries the amount of completed levels that match the requirement (e.g. \"basic syntax\" levels) to unlock the achievement. As far as I can see, that is not how these achievements are handled currently.\n\nWhen you beat a \"basic syntax\" level, it just increments your user's `stats.concepts.basic_syntax` counter. Removing the \"first time only\" restriction means you would have to resubmit 50 levels in order to unlock the \"Completed 50 Basic Syntax Levels\" achievement. I believe we can agree that this would be rather unpleasant, right?\n\nSo, for your suggested approach to work correctly, we would first have to rewrite most of the achievements earning system, which completely kills your \"minimal changes\" motivation.\n\nI'd suggest taking another look at my suggestions [above](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/3214#issuecomment-202221319). Note that the \"batched processing\" I've suggested can be replaced by MongoDB's built-in streaming fetch mode.\n You're right, it wouldn't be pleasant to resubmit 50 levels... Thus, both your suggested solutions seem to be OK. Or they could be merged, so that you have a \"request update\" button on the achievements modal, and then all requests are processed in a batch once a day (or every few hours).\n After giving this a bit more of thought, it may be possible to mix and match @anter69's suggestion into a third option, which would consist of the following steps:\n1. Check for unlocked achievements on every victory submission, not just the first one;\n2. For each programming concept associated with the level, recalculate the user's score in the given concept. More specifically, query the amount of levels that the user has beaten associated with the given concept, then save the new count in the user's `stats.concepts` object.\n3. Finally, for each updated concept score, award the achievements for the given concept that require <= the user's score that have not been awarded yet.\n\nI'd give special attention to the 3rd point above, as I've just been awarded the \"Completed 5 recursion levels\" but I have not received the \"Completed 2 recursion levels\" achievement yet! (Seriously, lol)\n\nI know this approach may sound a bit complicated, but the other two suggestions I've posted are not very easy either. Well, perhaps a recalc button in the Achievements modal that would refresh the scores for all concepts would be easier to implement and reason about, but perhaps harder for users to find.\n\nI'd like some feedback from the CodeCombat before I start dedicating time to implementing a fix.\n That sounds like the performance would be kind of slow, right?\n\nI think the current approach should work to trigger the old achievements that should match the achievement query, since we know when a new level is beaten and successfully make a new achievement for the highest tier, but there must be some bug where it's not also making the ones for lower tiers. Maybe we can just fix the bug?\n > That sounds like the performance would be kind of slow, right?\n\nI'm not sure about performance. We are already hitting the server for every successful submission, right? I haven't checked the perf impact of the achievement unlocking logic yet, but I assume most people won't be repeatedly hitting the servers with successful submissions (except the most hardcore players trying for best seeds/high scores).\n\nWith your suggestion, one of the remaining problems is that people who have completed all available levels (reportedly [another user](https://discourse.codecombat.com/t/i-have-not-some-achievements/7264) experiencing the same issue and me) would have to wait until a new level that presents the specific concept is released, which would be a pretty bad experience IMO.\n My migration script should cover it, if we fix the just-in-time issue; just the migration script takes a long time to load all levels so we can index by concept.\n Oh, nice!\n So, I took a look on this. The issue is in the [`alreadyAchieved` logic](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/9f3aac3313b9d1658b7ab11e3168c8551a44697f/server/plugins/achievements.coffee#L42). It considers an achievement as already achieved if the `unchangedCopy` (the user's data prior to this level session submission) would suffice to unlock it; it does not check whether a corresponding `earnedAchievement` actually exists in the db.\n\nUnder \"normal\" circumstances (i.e. the achievement already exists at the time the user reaches its unlock requirement), the current logic would suffice. The problem occurs when you create a new achievement and given users are already past its unlock requirement.\n\nSo there is the bug where unlocking a higher tier achievement is not also unlocking the lower ones. I believe this would not be a problem in practice if you run a migration script whenever new achievements are created.\n\nDo you think we should still improve the achievement unlocking logic?\n To be more clear, the migrations should not only set the players' stats but also unlock any achievements that these new stats would have earned. Then the current achievement unlocking logic would suffice without changes.\n\nI could improve the achievement unlocking logic to ensure that lower-tiered achievements are properly unlocked, but this should not be necessary if the migrations properly unlock those achievements.\n\n@nwinter WDYT?\n I did have [this script](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/scripts/recreateEarnedAchievements.coffee) at one time; it should still work, right? Maybe we should run this. @sderickson see any obvious issues with this script, or shall we fire it up?\n Updated and new achievements are now checked when you are on the site. Mainly set up in [this commit](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/2fe28852b4a717c269ae4daf3e9157bb8029bf66).\n Yay, thank you very much! \ud83d\ude04\n\nI've gave it a test and it seems to be working properly now, awesome work @sderickson.\n Wow, 20000 gems earned in a second! ;-) Thanks!\n  It would be useful to have a vertical scrollbar in long pages such as the [Thang Editor](http://codecombat.com/editor/thang).\n\nOther pages such as the profile page, settings page, multiplayer page, legal page, contribute page, home page and about page also never display a scrollbar, though its lack is admittedly less noticeable in pages that don't have much scrolling content.\n I would love to test it, but I'm not home atm and the [live server has been down for the last 24 hours](https://discourse.codecombat.com/t/its-a-bug-or-not/6719).\n @Imperadeiro98 Was that commit deployed to production? I'm still not seeing any scrollbars in the main site.\n\nHowever, I noticed this issue seems to be a dupe of #2711. Let's continue the discussion there.\n I just tried `direct.codecombat.com` via an US VPN, the scrollbars are appearing correctly. :smile:\nI guess #2711 can be closed as well now.\n It seems a bit odd though. The deploy was made about a week ago and the changes did not propagate to the BR CDN yet (tested with cache disabled).\n  If I type 'if', no autocomplete suggestion is made.\n  Ladder game simulation crashes frequently (every 20-30 minutes for me), which makes it hard to simulate a lot of games (and earn those extra gems).\n\nCan something be done to prevent the crashes? Are these caused by bad code submitted? Can that even happen? Can those be detected and removed (automagically) somehow? Or could the page be set to reload every 10 minutes (or so)?\n\nConfig: win 7 + chrome 45, but it also happens on linux and firefox (all combinations) on 3 different computers.\n\nHere are the console outputs of some crashed simulations (most recent first):\n\n```\nFinding game to simulate...\nwidgets.js:1 GET https://platform.twitter.com/js/button.c44c2dc193c555561d5830b3b543eb26.js net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENTFunction.bind.test.window.__twttr.window.__twttr.widgets.window.__twttr.widgets.init.e.e @ widgets.js:1r @ widgets.js:9a @ widgets.js:8(anonymous function) @ widgets.js:8o @ widgets.js:8r._flush @ widgets.js:9t.exports @ widgets.js:8p @ widgets.js:8\ndueling-grounds:1 Uncaught (in promise) undefined\ndueling-grounds:1 Uncaught (in promise) undefined\nCocoModel.coffee:95 Populated defaults for Level Zero Sum in 22ms\nVM424:34 Generated random seed 3795144476 of type playerSession from sessionIDs [\"550828a45106ef000de40cea\", \"55172d3a81389437054de9eb\"] submissionCount 4\nLevelLoader.coffee:416 World has been initialized from level loader.\nLevelLoader.coffee:311 SuperModel for Level loaded in 1043 ms\nGod.coffee:70 Venus: Let there be light upon Zero Sum!

I found that it worked for an entire day and it didn't crashed itself on simulating.  After half an hour of simulating, it will use around 2-3GB of RAM.

On the other hand, if u want to simulate for half an hour and make it fast, u should download Chrome 64Bit, which u have to select different platform when u download it.\n Still have problem on Google Chrome, but not Microsoft Edge.  However, Microsoft Edge uses 2-4GB of RAM.  I think the simulating software has some problem of keep using too much memory then it crashes out.

I also read few articles on WIKI, how CodeCombat is organised.\nNow I would like to change auto complete text for findNearestEnemy (from \"self:findNearestEnemy\" to \"self:findNearestEnemy()\").\n\nFor every level, user has to write a code. On right side of screen there is special editor, which is used to type code. This editor has auto complete feature - which behaviour I would like to modify for LUA. I guess that the editor is written in JavaScript, and code for this editor is executed on a client PC. If so, then I guess that it must be implemented somewhere in /app/ folder.\n\nCould someone confirm that my above conclusions are correct? Could someone please give me a tip, where I should start my implementation (where I should look at - which files/folders)? Maybe the editor (and auto complete feature) are third party program? (if so where is it? which one is it?) Maybe auto complete feature uses database somehow to provide it's functionality? \nIs there any documentation related to this topic, which I should read?\n\nRegards,\nIkeban\n Thank you nwinter for fix - I see where you changed it and I will try to fix other things which I spotted during my LUA adventure in CodeCombat.\n Update:\nI noticed that issue with self:findNearestEnemy() was fixed by Deatrix in 5th of November - and it is still pending patch :) I think that this patch can be now rejected - because it was fixed without patch by nwinter - admin has this powers!\n  This occurs when using the ingame code editor, and having glasses with `@distanceTo`.\n\nWhen partially typing `@distanceTo` it will start predicting. When pressing enter it will fill in the rest of the code with it's prediction, which comes out to be `@distanceTo(target)`.\n\nThis may be valid Coffeescript, I'm not sure, but when hovering the mouse over the `@distanceTo target` method it shows the syntax as being `distance = @distanceTo target` and not `@distanceTo(target)`\n\nI can see how this could confuse someone if it wasn't previously explained. \n  In this mission for Lua is the secont help comment not startet with -- but with # \n Hi headspeak, \n\nI fixed it, and my patch is now in pending state.\nIf you want to see it, please select \"Patches\" tab from this link: http://codecombat.com/editor/level/patrol-buster\nThank you for reporting this issue.\n thx all :-)\nI start to dive deeper in this project so I will be able to fix by my self.\n  Finishing this [level, A Mayhem of Munchkins](http://codecombat.com/play/level/a-mayhem-of-munchkins) results in a screen that stays still forever. \n![screen shot 2015-11-06 at 21 36 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6825082/11008252/8cce6afe-84cf-11e5-9b66-e3856bc5bc51.png)\n You're welcome!\n  There are a few files that have unused properties in them.\n\nExample: \n- [x] https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/achievements.sass\n- [x] https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/blog.sass (is it used?)\n- [x] https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/contact.sass (is it used?)\n I found out that blog.sass and contact.sass are not used anywhere.\nachievements.sass is used by AchievementPopup, however, it is not used anywhere, I think these files should be dropped, too.

I think it is easier to provide smaller patches, it makes rollback faster and can be easily reviewed.\n\nAlso, I've found some 'wording' issues in this patch. E.g. on certain pages 'payments' has already been translated as 'Pagos', and you are using 'Facturas'. Worths to check previous commits or other sentences to build a common wording guide.\n\nI was about to start doing it and then I saw your PR. Do you want to split tasks? \n  Some visible strings on the UI for a free account.\n  Some visible strings on the UI for a free account.\n  I'm a total Sass/Jade noob and I wasn't able to test my changes. If anything looks funny, please let me know.\n  self.moveXY() seems to be including some kind of speed offset to the position requested, so your position ends up offset from what you requested.\n\n```\nwhiteX = {'x':27, 'y':42}\nredX = {'x':151 , 'y': 118}\nmin = 999999\nmax = 0\nfor trap in self.findByType(\"fire-trap\"):\n    if trap.value > max:\n        max = trap.value\n    if trap.value < min:\n        min = trap.value\n\nvalue = min + max\nself.moveXY(28, 42)\nself.say(value)\n```\n\narryn + speed ring results in a large enough offset that the cat does not disable the traps on the say.\n\n3 runs, one with anya, two with arryn, 3 with arryn + speed ring\n\n![sarven sum 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6243417/10116081/8c620916-63d9-11e5-9045-a65b7c2d814c.png)\n![sarven sum 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6243417/10116080/8c61d144-63d9-11e5-9672-19654dbd7c11.png)\n![sarven sum 3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6243417/10116082/8c62cb3a-63d9-11e5-98f3-bd3c719700f7.png)\n  I'm sure that many of us have seen the weird case where an artillery manages to accelerate to a speed beyond the maximum velocity set for an artillery.\n\nAfter poking around, I produced a small code block that can produce the issue.  It seems to revolve around using the \"attack\" command to pick a target outside of the attack range, then switching to \"attackPos\" to attack the ground (somewhere within range), then issuing a few \"move\" commands in sequence to trigger.\n\nCode Sample (Tested in the \"Ace of Coders\" level, against multiple opponents):\n\n``` javascript\nthis.summon(\"artillery\");\nvar artillery = this.findByType(\"artillery\", this.findFriends())[0];\nvar eGol = this.findByType(\"goliath\", this.findEnemies())[0];\nloop {\n    this.command(artillery, \"attack\", eGol);\n    this.move(new Vector(0, 0));\n    this.command(artillery, \"attackPos\", new Vector(40, 40));\n    this.move(new Vector(0, 0));\n    // this.move(new Vector(0, 0)); // Uncomment to time it perfectly for the artillery to hit itself\n    // this.move(new Vector(0, 0)); // Uncomment to time it perfectly for the artillery to hit itself\n    this.command(artillery, \"move\", new Vector(0, 0));\n    loop {\n        this.command(artillery, \"move\", new Vector(0, 0));\n        this.move(new Vector(0, 0));\n    }\n}\n```\n Here's some more code that triggers the bug:\n\n``` javascript\nvar timeAfterShotToMove = 3; // Bug occurs: 0.25 .. 3\nvar timeBetweenShots = 4; // Bug occurs: max(1, (cd + 0.25))\n                          // Default Cooldown = 3.6 (effectively 3.75)\nthis.summon(\"artillery\");\nvar shot;\nloop {\n    var arty = this.findFriends()[1];\n    if (!arty) continue;\n    if (shot && shot === this.now() - timeAfterShotToMove) {\n        this.command(arty, \"move\", this.getControlPointsMap().farB.pos);\n    } else if (!shot || shot === this.now() - timeBetweenShots) {\n        this.command(arty, \"attackPos\", this.getControlPointsMap().center.pos);\n        shot = this.now();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso tested in the level editor with various cooldowns. It seems that the bug revolves around some \"ignored\" momentum that is gained when using a move command within 3 seconds of artillery attacking. If the artillery attacks again on cooldown and moves again after attacking, the momentum seems to multiply.\n   Hi @Imperadeiro98! I signed the CLA. Can you please merge it?\n   np ;)\n  :+1: \n    Master\n  The autocomplete for setFlowerColor (in Javascript) has an extra semicolon and shows up like this:\n\n`this.setFlowerColor(\"red\");;`\n  Translate some strings and correted the translation of some other ones\n  After messing around with Ace of Coders for a while I've hit the following issue a bunch of times. On compiling certain code, my hero stands motionless but the UI doesn't indicate any code errors, and no Ice Yaks spawn. I get the following message in the JavaScript console:\n\n<pre>\nERROR in transforms.getUserFnMap RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded\n    at Array.toString (native)\n    at h (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2578:15)\n    at h (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2580:27)\n    at s (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2574:70)\n    at s (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2575:103)\n    at h (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2579:294)\n    at s (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2574:70)\n    at s (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2575:103)\n    at h (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2579:294)\n    at s (http://codecombat.com/javascripts/aether.js:2574:70)\n</pre>\n\n\nI don't have a minimal example for this, but it seems to happen reliably with certain versions of my code. I'm guessing it's a transpiler bug rather than a problem with my code, but I'm sure I could be proven wrong. I could share my code privately with a dev if this is helpful.\n Okay, @nwinter, here is the smallest complete example I could come up with. When pasted into the editor for Ace of Coders, I get the mentioned error in the console.\n\n``` javascript\nvar v = new Vector(0, 0);\n\nthis.foo = function (units) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < units.length; ++i) {\n        var unit = units[i];\n        var d = unit.pos.distance(v);\n    }\n};\n\nthis.bar = function (units) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < units.length; ++i) {\n        var unit = units[i];\n        var d = unit.pos.distance(v);\n    }\n};\n```\n\nSome observations:\n- Deleting either function makes the error go away\n- Replacing either occurrence of `units[i]` with `units[0]` makes the error go away\n\nHappy debugging!\n Hmm, I see now that renaming the `units` parameter in one of the functions to something else is also enough to avoid triggering the error.\n\nI can probably work with this, assuming that this solves the problem in my competitive code. Isolating this bug has stolen all my motivation for the short-term though, so I'll have to wait for another time to see how things go.\n I've also been encountering this bug. I've been working around it by, like you, fiddling with the problematic functions. Usually it's changing `unitA.distanceTo(unitB)` to `unitA.pos.distance(unitB.pos)`.\n :+1: \n Should be fixed with @basicer's new Esper interpreter.\n  I've changed and added a bit. The problem with public translations are that people tend to translate words one way, while one does it another way. It's not the first time I've seen this. Over the upcoming weeks, I'm probably going to translate alot into danish, and I hope that'll fit pretty close to the rest of the translator's translations. Cheers!\n There we go :)\n  Links inside descriptions are not reachable in the game view, as the description will close immediately after the mouse leaves the item (trigger) associated with the description:\n\n![](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s534/sh/f711b240-a756-4cbf-ad63-3ab9d1f3fa0f/312b0869e0ad83c88c47fd0917d95ee0/res/54cd231f-c91a-4d8a-96c7-37f9847f6705/skitch.jpg)\n\nI'm not sure what approach we should take to fix this.\n Hover should show it only when hovered over the item, click should keep it on screen. Beware copy pasting ability, so highlighting anything in a description should be disabled (only hyperlinking). Maybe?\n If clicking keeps the description on screen, there should be a clear indication of how to close it (like a \"X\" button in the top-right of the description). I'm aware that clicking the trigger (item) a second time usually closes the description, but I believe that is not clear enough to many users. Having both \"click a second time\" and X button in the description should be enough if we take that approach.\n\nI'm not sure if copying is really an issue, preventing users from copying usually goes against accessibility/usability guidelines. Do you suggest it because users may copy the code samples?\n\nI'm also considering alternative solutions, such as displaying the description directly to the left of the hovered item, so the user would be able to move the cursor to the description without closing it (that is, the description would be considered part of the trigger and be kept open while the user is hovering either the item or the description).\n  i have translated some string\n  I lean either way on this, but wondered what the expected behavior for this is.\n\nIncluded are two gifs, one 'frame-by-frame' one at full speed. Watch the arrows bounce and then collide with the player.\n\n![ricochet_damage_full_speed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9985594/9974746/91eba46c-5e54-11e5-8843-5341bd7ce1bf.gif)\n![ricochet_damage_frame_by_frame](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9985594/9974748/92aa2f72-5e54-11e5-8d0d-b6c038e2c72c.gif)\n   CLA signed. I translated a few tips, but could not find the objective strings to translate. For example:\nVillagers must survive\nBonus: no code problems\n\nThese strings are much more important to my kids which don't speak English yet. \nI search for these in the project but could not find them. Are they part of a different project / your proprietary levels? If so, could you maybe add the strings to the localization files and reference those instead of having them hard coded in English.\n\nI'd love to translate those!\n AH! found the level translation editor through a forum post: http://codecombat.com/i18\nSomehow I missed it on the diplomat page and went straight to github :)\n BTW just translated the second Gems in the Deep level and found out that there is an Overview section that gives a lot of useful info on completing a level. For example that you can give the movement functions parameters! I had not discovered this nor had any of my three boys.\n\nI went hunting for it in the level and found it under the Game menu -hamburger menu. Not discoverable at all. Maybe a separate Tips / Overview -button could be added to the main level page next to the code?\n  as the title says\n  Steps: \n1. Login to your account\n2. On the Overworld map, select Items.\n3. While on the items screen, Select Unlock (Do not Confirm) on 2 items that your total gems can afford individually but added you could not.\n4. Select Confirm on both.\n5. You will get a 403 error and both items will be added to your account, with a negative balance of what you would otherwise have had to pay.\n6. When logging into a stage, you can then equip both items to get both bonuses.\n7. You will maintain the negative balance of gems and both item bonuses until you un-equip the second item confirmed.\n\nOnce you log off and back on, if you do not equip the second item, it is refunded and removed from your inventory.\n Confirmed, the item is still there after a screen refresh.

More dots will require a map key and complicate the UI, so I'd try to avoid that one.\n   2, 3. Do we still move levels around the map a bit that would require illustrator updates?\n\nFor difficult optional levels, we could detect when a user may be stuck and suggest an alternate level.  This would allow players to explore optional levels without them getting stuck there.\n\nThe yellow suggestion arrow should work correctly, independent of this issue.\n  Translated: Clans, user.\nand some fixes for fluency\n     Another example of partially unsubscribed recipients:\ncus_6gd7aOr5LqEoym\n11 recipient subs in Stripe, incremental set to 11588\nNo recipient users have stripe.sponsorID set\n16 recipients in stripe.recipients set on sponsor user\n   I have signed the CLA as requested.\n  translate\n Okay, signed\n  this one works well, finally fixed the whole problem and thx @lazydogP for helping this translation and solved the problem\n DO NOT MERGE, need a final check for make sure the both zh-HANS and zh-HANT are correct\n  finished both zh-HANS and zh-HANT translation\n i don't know what i can do for it......the zh-HANS.coffee seemed damaged\n    Ah, this is when scrolling down.

Styles are [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/account/account-settings-view.sass#L7-L20.\n I personally think that the current 'save' button is fine. But if you want to change it, how about completely removing the wide 'save' button and then putting a smaller button in each white section ? Would it be a good idea ? \n\n![selection_003](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3805149/9246276/7e0bf4e6-41e5-11e5-881c-e1a3079bfff1.png)\n I think that would be kind of a pain to do given the way it is built, compared to finding a way to make the global save button more visible/intuitive. (I had three problem reports on not being able to find the save button in the past few days, which seems a bit more like bad design than than a coincidence.)\n How about this?\n\n#### No Changes\n\n<img width=\"1139\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-08-14 at 11 45 35 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2450760/9264364/b88e1eb6-4279-11e5-87b3-0902920d9367.png\">\n\n#### Save\n\n<img width=\"1141\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-08-14 at 11 46 04 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2450760/9264365/b8b3a456-4279-11e5-8bd5-a79b37e0c23c.png\">\n I think it is an improvement!\n If some user is currently at the top of the setting page, will he/she be able to see the 'save' button ?

The way I have it right now, the button is hidden by default. When the onInputChanged event is triggered, the button fades in in the top right corner:\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-18 at 12 45 25 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7356884/11236392/1f74bb12-8d8e-11e5-83b5-12746ae51e5c.png\">\nWhen the user clicks the button, it acknowledges the change (assuming it was a successful save), and fades back out. In terms of styling, the button perhaps could use some more work to 'mesh' more with the background.\n Ah I see. How about if we take one of those sign modals? Like so:\n<img width=\"1907\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-11-19 at 1 21 37 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7356884/11266785/03564d8c-8e5c-11e5-82e2-32dc35568d63.png\">\n I think I'd vote for having it be at the bottom of the page, because that's expected.\n\nAnother option would be to use Bootstrap affix, by having the save button take up a column, maybe 2 wide, and the other columns would go from 6 to 5.\n @nwinter @sderickson Hmm then I think kumabotz's picture above makes the most sense, having it be at the bottom of options.

However, looks like it is throwing an error (which is silently ignored due to a try/catch in the FB JS API file), and thus it fails silently and `window.FB` is not defined.\n    Hey, i just saw a wrong uppercase on line 250, on my edditions.

I'd say it's worth keeping in if the cost is updating our janky sniffer every time Microsoft releases a new browser.\n I see your point. However, this also means that if someone is determined enough to use such exploit, they can just play using IE11+/Edge as `importScripts` is not blacklisted there, correct? Perhaps we could improve the locking to work more reliably cross-browser.\n Yeah, it just helps in case someone is testing things out to see what they can/can't access and thinks we've locked it down without reading all the code to figure out where (assuming they aren't doing their poking around in IE). \n [@nwinter's fix](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/1d81133f24ed385af9066504a5e0fa0f30ec6129) works great here, I believe this issue can be closed.\n  In the [campaigns map](https://codecombat.com/play), when I click the 'Buy Gems' button, no sound is reproduced to let me know that a window was opened (and the same when it is closed).\nThe same happens with 'Settings', which appears when I'm not logged in.\n  When going to the [campaigns map](https://codecombat.com/play) and clicking the 'Items' or the 'Achievements' buttons in the bottom left of the screen, the \"opening sound\" is reproduced twice.\n You could not play the sound until after the first finished render had happened so that fake clicks to select tabs in the `afterRender` method don't make clicking noises.\n   Hello, @kikojumkd! Thank you for contributing. Can you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n   @nwinter signed.\n   You're welcome @nwinter \n\nI noticed my commits broke the build. I'm still investigating why. I'll fix the issue once I discover it.\n\nI'll make sure to run tests next time I make commits to the repo.\n  I was recently delighted to learn about the `move` method for incremental motion towards a target provided by various high-level footwear, which prevented me from needed to implement it myself on every level that it was useful (most of them). However, there are issues that I have with the naming conventions and parameters for `move` and `moveXY` that I think serve as an unnecessary barrier for people learning to code with this excellent game.\n1. The fact that `move` refers to moving incrementally and `moveXY` refers to moving until a point is reached is deeply unintuitive. There's nothing about the naming of these methods that would lead one to associate one behavior with one and the other behavior with the other. What about `moveTowardXY` and `moveToXY`? It's more to type, but with the code completion facilities that the editor provides, that's not really a bit deal.\n2. I see no good reason for these two methods to use different calling conventions. Why should `move` take a dict/object with x and y fields, but `moveXY` take two parameters? I can sort of see the logic - the fact that the name includes `XY` suggests an X parameter and a Y parameter - but that's completely ancillary to the actual difference in behavior of the two methods. It seems very arbitrary, and we should be showing new programmers that programming is about making abstractions clean and intuitive, not about memorizing arbitrary rules. Let them deal with messy API's when and if they have to learn OpenGL. :smile:\n3. Even if there was a good reason for the two methods to use different calling conventions, differences between programming language idioms make the current use of a dict/object for `move` problematic. In Python, there are two idiomatic ways that one might represent the Javascript idiom of passing in an object literal with x and y properties:\n   1. Use named parameters, so the call would be like `self.move(x = 50, y = 25)`\n   2. Use an object/namedtuple, so the call would be like `self.move(Pos(50, 25))`. This is what we'd probably want to do here, since the reason for the use of a Javascript object literal is to stand in place of a pos object.\n\nBut passing in a dict with x and y fields in lieu of a pos object is not how things are normally done in Python, and for good reason - if the method expects an object, its fields would be accessed with dot syntax, which doesn't work with Python dicts! Sure, you could include a runtime check for whether the thing passed in is an instance of dict, and in that case use dict accessing syntax instead of object property accessing syntax\u2026 but that's pretty hacky.\n\nIn summary, my suggestions are:\n1. Rename `move` to `moveTowardXY` and `moveXY` to `moveToXY`\n2. Have both methods take two positional arguments, one for x and one for y.  \n  Just adding a loading screen tip, as another small initial commit.\n Sure thing. Should have noticed that. Moved and uncommented.\n  - This updates the vagrant provisioning script to correctly set the ulimits in Ubuntu, since the `bin/coco-brunch` file can't set them properly when run as the vagrant user.\n- Added some basic support into the Vagrantfile for VMware providers and uploaded a VMware compatible vagrant box based on trusty64 to https://github.com/spkane/vagrant-boxes/releases/download/v1.0.0/trusty64_vmware.box, that folks can use.\n @nwinter The ulimits issue was causing some problems, but once that was resolved, it seems to work, as I can finally get the site to start locally (initially it was simply a blank screen). I haven't tried to do any real work with it yet, but as I do I might provide some additional tweaks.\n  Added more names for #53\n  I'm not entirely sure if this problem is unique to my account but it appears that the \"Wooden Builder's Hammer\" has a missing or broken doll sprite.\n\nScreenshot below (I've noticed this for a couple days now... I've changed heroes, logged in and out, and cleared cache to no avail)\n\nMissing Right hand sprite: ![Missing Right hand sprite](http://i.imgur.com/0cZ7wYs.png)\n Confirmed, it is broken for me as well.\n Just confirming that the issue is still there:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12795864/14737399/2cfd09d8-087c-11e6-8e62-fc99be23c0e4.png)\n We got one for the wooden hammer but don't have them for the later hammers yet.\n ...and where could one update (at least copy-paste) it?\n I pasted the wooden doll images into the other available hammers for now.  Hi, I have an issue.\n\nwhat operating system,\nWindows 7.\n\nwhat browser(s),\nFirefox and Google Chrome\n\nexactly when it stops working and what you see,\nI completed the map Backwoods Brawl in 3th lvl, I received more than 600 gems but they were not computed.\n\nwhat programming language you're using,\nLua.\n\nwhat level isn't working,\nBackwoods Brawl.\n\nand whether it worked before or has never worked.\nI received gems from other lvls.\n\nThanks for your attention.\n even if the gems shown when the level is complete is the difference in the value, they are not being awarded.  i completed \"Backwoods Treasure\" 3 times and the 3rd time it said \"+437\" gems, but i only received 110 gems.  so it doesn't matter whether its displaying the difference or what the level is worth, its not giving the correct amount of gems, and i just lost out on a whole lot of gems.\n as far as i can tell, its the same on all of the replayable levels.\n oh yeah, using ubuntu 14.04 lts, running mozilla firefox, programming in python, completed backwoods brawl 3 times and backwoods treasure 3 times only getting around 100 gems not the 400+ that the level says when completed.\n I've just thought a bit about this and came up with (what I believe to be) a good solution. I've [posted it in the forum](https://discourse.codecombat.com/t/incorrect-gem-awarding-on-defeating-backwoods-brawl-multiple-times/2637/7?u=ultcombo), but I'll repost the UI suggestion here for commodity:\n\nIf the user has already beaten at least one round, display an \"Already earned on previous rounds\" section in the victory screen, which is shown as already unlocked (no unlock/counting animations) and contains the sum of all previous rounds' exp and gems. Then, below the \"Already earned on previous rounds\" section, show an achievement for the round that has just been beaten, containing the appropriate reward amounts and the unlock/counting up animations.\n\nDoes this sound good?\n That would be a better solution, but I think to keep things simple, I'll just keep it at what I just implemented: only showing the new gems, not the old ones you earned in previous rounds. Will deploy this fix later this week.\n    I find links without underline more modern :)\n  Translation of \"concepts\" section to french.\n    Please pull commits made on June 24, 2015 and June 25, 2015. They broke the build that was passing. Thanks :)\n Sorry, sometimes I have a hard time explaining what I mean. I need a little time to figure out the best way to help you understand. I will get back to you ASAP.\n  This sample code using ES5's [`Array#forEach`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) does not seem to work:\n\n``` js\nthis.findEnemies().forEach(function(enemy) {\n    this.say(enemy.type); // never runs\n}, this);\nthis.say('hello'); // runs\n```\n\nIt looks like the `forEach` is just being skipped.\n\nAlso, note that not providing a `thisArg` also results in the same behavior, e.g.:\n\n``` js\nvar that = this;\nthis.findEnemies().forEach(function(enemy) {\n    that.say(enemy.type); // never runs\n});\nthis.say('hello'); // runs\n```\n\nIs this possibly an Aether bug?\n This seems to work nicely in Aether (testing with master branch):\n\n``` js\nthis.findEnemies().forEach(function(enemy) {\n    this.say(enemy.type);\n}, this);\n```\n\nAether setup (adapted from demo page):\n\n``` js\nvar thisValue = {\n    findEnemies: function() {\n        return [{ type: 'foo' }];\n    },\n    say: console.log\n};\nvar aetherOptions = {\n  executionLimit: 1000,\n  problems: {jshint_W040: {level: \"ignore\"}}\n};\nvar aether = new Aether(aetherOptions);\nvar code = grabDemoCode();\naether.transpile(code);\nvar method = aether.createMethod(thisValue);\naether.run(method);\ndemoShowOutput(aether);\n```\n\nThis correctly logs \"foo\" to the console.\n I assume I'm missing some of the \"API protection\" part in order to reproduce the bug.\n I've added `protectAPI: true` to the `aetherOptions`, still can't reproduce.\n Yes, the code in the [comment above](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/2874#issuecomment-117432163) works in Aether -- though, I don't see any trace of Regenerator/yields in the generated output.\n\nPerhaps it would be easier to debug if I run it inside CodeCombat.\n Oh I see. Thanks for the pointers. `:D`\nWith `yieldConditionally: true`, I don't get any output in the console.\nI guess we have to take a look at the code before it goes through Traceur.\n Here's the code before being traceured:\n\n``` js\n(function (__global) {\n    var tmp0, tmp1;\n    tmp1 = function* () {\n        'use strict'; _aether.logCallStart(_aether._userInfo); var tmp2, tmp3, tmp4, tmp5, tmp6, tmp7, tmp14;\n        tmp4 = __interceptThis(this, __global);\n        tmp5 = 'findEnemies';\n        _aether.logStatementStart([{ofs: 0, row: 0, col: 0}, {ofs: 18, row: 0, col: 18}]); tmp2 = _aether.convertToNativeType(tmp4[tmp5]());  if (!_aether._shouldSkipFlow) { _aether.vars['enemy'] = typeof enemy == 'undefined' ? undefined : enemy; _aether.vars['foo'] = typeof foo == 'undefined' ? undefined : foo; } _aether.logStatement([{ofs: 0, row: 0, col: 0}, {ofs: 18, row: 0, col: 18}], _aether._userInfo, !_aether._shouldSkipFlow); if (_aether._shouldYield) { var _yieldValue = _aether._shouldYield; _aether._shouldYield = false; if (this.onAetherYield) { this.onAetherYield(_yieldValue); } yield _yieldValue;  }\n        tmp3 = 'forEach';\n        _aether.logStatementStart([{ofs: 27, row: 0, col: 27}, {ofs: 74, row: 2, col: 1}]); tmp6 = function* (enemy) {\n            var tmp8, tmp9, tmp10, tmp11, tmp12, tmp13;\n            tmp8 = __interceptThis(this, __global);\n            tmp9 = 'say';\n            tmp11 = enemy;\n            tmp12 = 'type';\n            _aether.logStatementStart([{ofs: 59, row: 1, col: 13}, {ofs: 69, row: 1, col: 23}]); tmp10 = tmp11[tmp12];  if (!_aether._shouldSkipFlow) { _aether.vars['enemy'] = typeof enemy == 'undefined' ? undefined : enemy; _aether.vars['foo'] = typeof foo == 'undefined' ? undefined : foo; } _aether.logStatement([{ofs: 59, row: 1, col: 13}, {ofs: 69, row: 1, col: 23}], _aether._userInfo, !_aether._shouldSkipFlow);\n            _aether.logStatementStart([{ofs: 50, row: 1, col: 4}, {ofs: 70, row: 1, col: 24}]); tmp13 = _aether.convertToNativeType(tmp8[tmp9](tmp10));  if (!_aether._shouldSkipFlow) { _aether.vars['enemy'] = typeof enemy == 'undefined' ? undefined : enemy; _aether.vars['foo'] = typeof foo == 'undefined' ? undefined : foo; } _aether.logStatement([{ofs: 50, row: 1, col: 4}, {ofs: 70, row: 1, col: 24}], _aether._userInfo, !_aether._shouldSkipFlow); if (_aether._shouldYield) { var _yieldValue = _aether._shouldYield; _aether._shouldYield = false; if (this.onAetherYield) { this.onAetherYield(_yieldValue); } yield _yieldValue;  }\n            return;\n        };  if (!_aether._shouldSkipFlow) { _aether.vars['enemy'] = typeof enemy == 'undefined' ? undefined : enemy; _aether.vars['foo'] = typeof foo == 'undefined' ? undefined : foo; } _aether.logStatement([{ofs: 27, row: 0, col: 27}, {ofs: 74, row: 2, col: 1}], _aether._userInfo, !_aether._shouldSkipFlow);\n        tmp7 = __interceptThis(this, __global);\n        _aether.logStatementStart([{ofs: 0, row: 0, col: 0}, {ofs: 81, row: 2, col: 8}]); tmp14 = _aether.convertToNativeType(tmp2[tmp3](tmp6, tmp7));  if (!_aether._shouldSkipFlow) { _aether.vars['enemy'] = typeof enemy == 'undefined' ? undefined : enemy; _aether.vars['foo'] = typeof foo == 'undefined' ? undefined : foo; } _aether.logStatement([{ofs: 0, row: 0, col: 0}, {ofs: 81, row: 2, col: 8}], _aether._userInfo, !_aether._shouldSkipFlow); if (_aether._shouldYield) { var _yieldValue = _aether._shouldYield; _aether._shouldYield = false; if (this.onAetherYield) { this.onAetherYield(_yieldValue); } yield _yieldValue;  }\n        _aether.logCallEnd(); return;\n    };\n    tmp0 = 'foo';\n    __global[tmp0] = tmp1;\n}(this));\n```\n\nIt is passing a generator (`tmp6`) as the callback to the `forEach` call, which is effectively a no-op -- each iteration calls the generator, which simply spawns an iterator and does nothing with it.\n\nSeeing as the JavaScript engine is responsible for calling the function, I don't see how the current yielding strategy could be applied here.\n\nDoes Aether's yielding handle functions which are passed to a 3rd party which expects a regular function (instead of a generator), given that this 3rd party is responsible for calling the function? Has this scenario appeared before?\n This is almost the same problem as https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/2635#issuecomment-90320467.\n\nThere are 2 parts to the issue:\n- Passing a function by reference to another function (both defined inside the sandboxed code) -- this may be fixable by patching up the code a little bit more.\n- Passing a function by reference to a built-in function (e.g. `Array#forEach`, `Array#map`). The built-ins were never meant to receive generators as callbacks.\n  `[].forEach` and `[].map` synchronously execute the callback for each item in the array -- in the case of passing a generator function, they will simply call it spawning an iterator object and doing nothing with it, these built-ins have no concept of generators/yielding.\n\nThe built-ins (as the name implies) are deeply ingrained in the JavaScript engine, so we can't just \"edit\"/\"transpile\" their code to magically understand generators and `yield*` them. There's no way to make the native `Array#forEach` wait for an iterator to close before advancing to the next iteration, as far as I can see. There's no way to make an \"one size fits all\" solution W.R.T. built-ins and generator callbacks.\n\nWhat we can do, however, is to override the native functions with functions that implement the same logic and have generator semantics. Then we are able to detect whether the callback is a generator function and `yield*` it, otherwise, if it is a regular function, apply the native function to it.\n\nThere are already some modules that implement generator semantics following built-ins' logic, e.g. [generator-foreach](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-foreach). We'd need one such implementation for each built-in function that accepts callback(s) which we want to patch.\n\nDoes this sound good? Does anyone have ideas?\n Using named function expressions with \"unyieldables\" throws an error. (Though I doubt anyone else would try this.)\n\n``` javascript\nvar xs = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\nthis.say(xs.map(function (x) { return x.split('') })) // [object Object],...\nthis.say(xs.map(function named (x) { return x.split('') })) // cannot read property \"apply\" of undefined\n```\n\n```\nhttp://codecombat.com/randotron_0.16341352253220975:22:512: yield is a reserved identifier\nhttp://codecombat.com/randotron_0.16341352253220975:22:518: Unexpected end of input\ntraceur had error trying to compile\nUncaught (in promise) No module specifiers in http://codecombat.com/randotron_0.16341352253220975\n```\n\nBoth work fine with the Aether demo though, so...\n @trotod Thanks for the report, that is in fact another bug -- Aether is not transforming named function expressions into generator expressions because [this regex](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/aa1279d894415df681bcb577b06b7039609ca308/src/transforms.coffee#L386) only matches anonymous function expressions. Should be easy enough to fix. **Edit:** here is the [PR](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/pull/148).\n > even if yielding doesn't work inside the passed function (usually you don't need to yield in it, because you're not taking some blocking action in there\u2013it'd just be nice to have the passed function run).\n\nNot sure if I follow. Isn't the yielding logic necessary to make methods which are asynchronous in nature such as `say()` and `moveXY()` seem like synchronously blocking? Considering these samples:\n\n``` js\nthis.findEnemies().forEach(function(enemy) {\n    this.say(enemy.type);\n}, this);\n```\n\n``` js\nthis.findFlags().forEach(function(flag) {\n    this.moveXY(flag.pos.x, flag.pos.y);\n}, this);\n```\n\nThis code would not behave as expected if we don't do the yielding, right?\n\nYour suggestion is an improvement, but it still leaves us in the \"It kinda works, but not always\" zone.\n\n> We are currently using traceur to turn generators into ES5, but we only do it to player code, not any library code. I'd like to not use it any further than I have to, as it's a gnarly dependency and makes things huge.\n\nMy idea would be to pre-compile the generatorified built-ins, so all that's necessary in CodeCombat would be to add a script in the web workers' `importScripts()`. I've been experimenting and it seems feasible so far.\n\n> (not just the JS ones, but the Python ones, Clojure ones, etc.)\n\nAdmittedly, I've overlooked this bit. I'm not sure how many of those other languages' runtime functions receive a function as parameter and don't directly delegate it to a JS built-in. A pre-compilation step might suffice in this case as well.\n Those samples would indeed fail, right. Ideally they would work, so maybe if it's not too much overhead, we can try some shims.\n\nI guess in the same way that we [add runtimeGlobals to Python](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/languages/python.coffee#L26-L27) and other parsers, we can add some to [the JS parser](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/languages/javascript.coffee#L21) that implement these overridden generator-aware functions.\n If we add them to the JS parser, does that make them specific to JS or to all other languages as well?\nSeeing as all other languages are compiled to JS (right?), all of them which support yielding can benefit of generator-aware functions, I believe.\n\nWouldn't [`Aether.replaceBuiltin`](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/74b2c5abdbfcc2231ebdf30a75a520c0450092e2/app/assets/javascripts/workers/worker_world.js#L393) be a better choice in this case?\n Also, I'm not 100% positive that I understand how `aether._shouldYield` works. Should I set it to true inside functions that return iterators which should be yielded?\n Yes, I guess we could try the `replaceBuiltin` approach, too. That gets more complicated because we currently have to call it in three places: [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/workers/worker_world.js#L329-L330), [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/workers/worker_world.js#L393-L394), and [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/Angel.coffee#L304-L305). There's probably a good place to put some `replaceBuiltin` calls inside Aether itself, though.\n\nWhen `yieldConditionally` is `true` (which is how CodeCombat always uses Aether now), then we insert a check on every method call to see if it's time to yield. So something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar kitten = this.findNearestKitten();\nkitten.explode();\nvar sadness = 17;\n```\n\ngets turned into something like this:\n\n```\nvar kitten = this.findNearestKitten(); if (_aether.shouldYield) { var _yieldValue = _aether._shouldYield; _aether.shouldYield = false; if (this.onAetherYield) { this.onAetherYield(_yieldValue); } yield _yieldValue; }\nkitten.explode(); if (_aether.shouldYield) { var _yieldValue = _aether._shouldYield; _aether.shouldYield = false; if (this.onAetherYield) { this.onAetherYield(_yieldValue); } yield _yieldValue; }\nvar sadness = 17;\n```\n\nNone of the yielding stuff happens if `_shouldYield` hasn't been set to true by the caller (in this case, the game engine). Maybe `findNearestKitten()` doesn't block, so it doesn't set `shouldYield`, but `explode` does, so it does set `shouldYield`.\n\nSo in this case, you still rely on the game engine to say whether a method that should yield has been called.\n This may be slightly off-topic (not an ES5 Array method), but [`Array.prototype.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) also does not work when using a custom `compareFunction`; the `compareFunction` never runs.\nIt's the same for [`Array.prototype.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and likely other Array methods where you provide a callback function.\n\nTry this code in [Multiplayer Treasure Grove](http://codecombat.com/play/level/multiplayer-treasure-grove):\n\n``` javascript\nfunction filterFunction(item) {\n    this.say(\"Filtering!\"); // Never runs\n    return item.type === \"coin\"; // Return only coins\n}\nfunction compareFunction(a, b) {\n    this.say(\"Comparing!\"); // Never runs\n    return (b.value / this.distanceTo(b)) - (a.value / this.distanceTo(a)); // Sort coins by weighted value (actual value / distance to hero)\n}\n\nthis.say(\"Hello, World!\"); // Runs as expected\n\nloop {\n    var items = this.findItems(); // Get array of nearby items\n    var coins = items.filter(filterFunction); // Filter items to just coins\n    var nextCoin = coins.sort(compareFunction)[0]; // Sort coins by weighted value then pick best coin\n    this.moveXY(nextCoin.pos.x, nextCoin.pos.y); // Move to pick up the coin\n}\n```\n\nYou'd expect it to pick up coins (somewhat) intelligently, but instead it never sorts or filters. so it just picks up the first item in the array each time.\n @SoullessWaffle `.sort()` is perfectly on-topic IMO. In fact, I'm planning to fix it with the patch I have in mind.\n\nThis issue can be generalized to all built-in high-order functions. I just didn't consider that JavaScript had built-in high-order functions prior to ES5 when I was naming this issue. I'll scope the experimental patch I'm working on to just Array methods for now though, to gather feedback from @nwinter before doing too much work.\n Not supporting Array builtins such as forEach is really annoying, especially since the inline JS docs for code combat explicitly list out the Array builtins.\n I've been very busy this last month, and the little free time I had was spent juggling between other projects.\n\nThough, I was very close to getting a PoC ready so I'll try to re-prioritize things a bit and get this out ASAP.\n Progress!\n\nAssignments whose RHS contains calls to built-in high-order functions whose callback contains call expression(s) now seem to work properly. E.g.:\n\n``` js\nfunction double(x) { return x * x; }\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3].map(function(n) { return double(n); });\n```\n\nI still have to fix the case when these are not part of assignment expressions, but they should be easier to handle now. These will use the same core logic, and their return value is not meaningful so they should be simpler to implement.\n\nA few issues that I ran into:\n- I could not find a way to access the `_aether` instance outside of the sandbox, is it possible to get a reference to it in the world worker? For now, I resorted to an ugly hack to get my patch working.\n- Aether replaces the `constructor` prototype property, so it was harder to detect generatorified functions at runtime. I implemented another temporary ugly hack.\n- Objects cloned with Aether's `createAPIClone` lose custom prototypes (e.g. objects instantiated from non-built-in constructors). Is this a safety measure or a limitation of Aether?\n\nI'll work a bit more on this and hopefully submit a PR for feedback later tonight.\n There can be multiple `_aether` instances, so doing something to it from `worker_world.js` may not be the right place to do it. Happy to take a look at how you're doing it and suggest a better place, and the way you're detecting generatorified functions.\n\nI haven't looked into preserving custom prototypes in the API protection step. Maybe that's actually the key we need to supporting more advanced features, or maybe it's a security hole, I don't know. We could mess around it [here](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/protectAPI.coffee#L84-L109).\n > There can be multiple `_aether` instances, so doing something to it from `worker_world.js` may not be the right place to do it. Happy to take a look at how you're doing it and suggest a better place, and the way you're detecting generatorified functions.\n\nMakes sense.\nI should be able to have a PR ready tonight. I've spent the last couple nights making up for my sleep deprivation. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:\n\n> I haven't looked into preserving custom prototypes in the API protection step. Maybe that's actually the key we need to supporting more advanced features, or maybe it's a security hole, I don't know.\n\nYes, keeping custom prototypes is key to supporting JavaScript constructors and other compile-to-JS languages' classes that make use of JS's prototypical inheritance. Though, simply adjusting the `createAPIClone` logic to preserve the prototype chain is not enough, as objects with custom prototypes will likely have constructors that implement custom logic with side-effects.\n\nI'm not really sure what is the purpose of the API protection and what kind of attacks it is supposed to prevent, so I don't know whether it is viable to make adjustments towards supporting custom prototypes and constructors.\n Hello. When you fix this problem? Any array method has been ignored.\n\nYou have terrible extend api mechanism (i have been found about 10 extend api bugs, common object api structure doesn't work) and now, i realize that i can't use common utils methods. It's not programming game - this is dance with a tambourine =)\n\nWhy not do you use  for js code \"eval\" method and for security checks async requests? Performance?\nSee, this is example normal api for creating correct user code: http://fightcodegame.com/docs/\n Hey. This issue is not fixed yet.\n\nBy the way, I haven't forgot about this issue. My life has been quite busy lately. I've also faced some (now fixed) issues with CodeCombat's dev environment when trying to work on this issue.\n\nIt turns out things were a bit more complicated than expected (as it usually is with everything related to programming). I've got some Array methods working with callbacks that contain call expressions, but some of the ones I'm working on are not working due to bugs in the dependencies.\n\nI'm now considering whether I should take a simpler approach with less dependencies. The current fix I'm working on adds over 40kb of JS code (already minified). Over 90% of this comes from dependencies, and one of these dependencies has a bug that breaks array methods that instantiate new arrays (e.g. `map`, `filter`).\n @Kinjeiro \n\n>  (i have been found about 10 extend api bugs, common object api structure doesn't work) and now, i realize that i can't use common utils methods.\n\nPlease report these separately. Your report is not really clear, please open a new issue and post sample code, what is the expected behavior and what is going wrong.\n\n> Why not do you use for js code \"eval\" method and for security checks async requests? Performance?\n> See, this is example normal api for creating correct user code\n\nI believe the API is not the problem, but rather the transformations that Aether applies to user code in order to prevent cheating and be able analise and time-travel the code execution. In fact, I personally don't understand why there is so much object cloning all over the place, but I know this gets in the way of having custom prototypes/constructors and also got in the way of my fix for the Array methods.\n It's amazing!!! Variable's name crashes program!\n\n``` javascript\n//doesn't work normal object structure\n//this.utils = {\n//  filter: function(...) {...}\n//}\nthis.utils_filter = function(array, predicate) {\n    var newArray = [];\n    for(var j=0; j<array.length; j++)\n        if (predicate(array[j])) \n            newArray.push(array[j]);\n    return newArray;\n};\n\n//doesn't work, when variable call \"predicate\" (like upper varibale in utils_filter)!! \u041e_\u041e \n//this.utils_map = function(array, predicate) {\n//  var newArray = [];\n//  for(var i=0; i<array.length; i++)\n//      newArray.push(predicate(array[i]));\n//  return newArray;\n//};\n\n//works\nthis.utils_map = function(array, predicate2) {\n    var newArray = [];\n    for(var i=0; i<array.length; i++)\n        newArray.push(predicate2(array[i]));\n    return newArray;\n};\n```\n User code's high-order functions (i.e. functions created by you that take a predicate as argument) are currently broken, yes. We're tracking those in #2635.\n\nThis topic is for a different issue, namely the language's built-in high-order functions. Although both problems seem nearly identical, they differ in fundamental points. It _might_ be possible to fix user code high-order functions by improving Aether's yielding logic, but it is not possible to fix the built-ins in the same way as long as Aether keeps transforming functions into generator functions.\n\nAnother approach that could be able to fix both issues is to replace the yielding behavior with synchronous loops (e.g. instead of `yield`, do `while (aether._shouldHoldOn())` or something). But if I recall correctly, @nwinter mentioned this approach has serious performance problems.\n The new plan is to fix all of this by moving to our own interpreter to run the AST directly instead of having to replace all blocking functions with generators behind the scenes. We will have far fewer bugs like this and much better peformance, plus some new features we haven't been able to do before. But it will take at least a few months to write the interpreter.\n @nwinter That's very interesting. Are there solid plans for this? My initial reaction is that rolling your own interpreter is a bad idea, but well, running user code is also generally a bad idea and CodeCombat does it decently well.\n This game have indescribable potencial! There are wonderful idea and atmosphere\nrealization!\nI wish you more strength and concentration to fix bugs.\nMay be sometimes i understand, why you use so complicated scheme.\n\nAbout my non concrete issues: there aren't many bugs, there are many architecture  problems, when i write own bot code. I'm web developer with 8 years experience, i builded big enterprise systems and architectures, but this style bot programing is very non structured and non logical. I want prototype programming or ES6 class sugar (translated with Babel) in my bot code. So all this issues have low priority.\n\nI apologize for my harsh tone =)\n @UltCombo Yup, @basicer has it all figured out and will start it as his next project. I was skeptical at first, but he convinced me that it's going to be awesome (and the current approach is probably overall more complicated than having done an interpreter from the start).\n\n@Kinjeiro We need deep integration into the game engine to make the code easy to understand for total beginners who don't know how to do callbacks and async requests, which is why we do many of the complicated things we do.\n Oh, nice. So the plan is to phase Aether out of CodeCombat or to just remove the yielding part and integrate Aether as part of the new interpreter?\n\nI'm wondering if it is worth to keep working on a fix for this on the current Aether version, as it seems things will change drastically soon. Seeing as it is estimated to take months for the new interpreter to be production-ready (and may likely have some unexpected delays), I guess it is still worth fixing this issue one way or another ASAP.\n I think Aether will still be the transpiler; it's just that most of the code generation part will be removed and replaced with the interpreter.\n\nI'd definitely like to see your current fixes integrated in the interim as long as performance is good. File size is pretty hopeless as it is, which is another thing we'll be able to drastically cut with the interpreter, since we won't need traceur or a few other big libraries.\n I'll try to submit a proof of concept ASAP, still it is pretty hacky and I'll have to fight my way through the dependencies' bugs. Hopefully I'll be able to fix/workaround these bugs and write the necessary documentation before or by the weekend.\n One option to try to attack this is to change the generated code, so that right before it invokes a function it checks to see if its a generator or a function thats its about to invoke, and then does the right thing.  Sending a user created function to an array method is always going to be dicy because we might have turned it into a generator and the ES5 array functions aren't going to be able to deal with that.  The current code (IIRC, its been a while) won't convert a function to a generator if it thinks that it is safe (if it contains no function calls other then ones that are marked as okay, but also I guess loops shouldn't be allowed either?).  It's suppose to track which function it did and did not convert so when it gets to the call site, it emits the right code; but instead we could also check at runtime.\n Thanks for the input, @basicer.\n\n> One option to try to attack this is to change the generated code, so that right before it invokes a function it checks to see if its a generator or a function thats its about to invoke, and then does the right thing.\n\nYes, I'm doing this as part of my generator-understanding built-ins polyfill. This part can most likely be re-used for user code functions as well.\n\n> Sending a user created function to an array method is always going to be dicy because we might have turned it into a generator and the ES5 array functions aren't going to be able to deal with that.\n\nYes, that's why I found it necessary to rewrite the built-ins in a such a way that if they do receive a generator function as callback, they do the right thing by calling the generator to instantiate an iterator and delegating all of its yields to the parent control flow, then use the iterator's completion value (i.e. the generator's `return` value) in place of the callback's return value for whatever logic the original algorithm used it. I know this sounds complicated, but you can see it is much simpler in practice:\n- My [generator-understanding `Array.prototype.map` implementation](https://github.com/UltCombo/innerator/blob/19c6a7da605674196ff471e149441639be7ddfb8/src/lib/Array.prototype.map.js#L41) implements the same logic as its built-in counterpart, closely following ECMA-262's current work, just with an `yield*` added to delegate the yielding control flow handling to the parent control flow.\n- When the polyfilled method receives a non-generator function as callback, then the original built-in function is used ([see how the polyfilling is done here](https://github.com/UltCombo/innerator/blob/19c6a7da605674196ff471e149441639be7ddfb8/src/index.js#L15-L39)). I had to add a `supportAether` option because Aetherified code has objects' `constructor` property replaced with a function that throws an error.\n- So, if the polyfilled method receives a generator function as callback, its return value will be an iterator, otherwise the return value will be the built-in method's return value. This means in order to properly integrate the polyfills into Aether, the return value of these functions must be checked: if they return an iterator, we must delegate the yielding to the parent control flow (this is the same as the first point I quoted in this comment, which @basicer has previously commented). I have most of this glue code already done in my local CodeCombat/Aether branches, but haven't pushed them to GitHub yet.\n\nI'll write this in more detail when I'm ready to submit a PR.\n\n> The current code (IIRC, its been a while) won't convert a function to a generator if it thinks that it is safe (if it contains no function calls other then ones that are marked as okay, but also I guess loops shouldn't be allowed either?)\n\nYes, functions that don't contain call expressions are not transformed into generators. IIRC the algorithm does not check whether the function calls inside the given function resolve to safe non-generator functions, i.e. it always transforms functions into generators if they contain any call expression. I'm not sure if functions containing loops and no call expressions are transformed.\n Hey people, I've finally had some free time to work on this and get a proof of concept running again. Here are the PRs:\n- codecombat/codecombat#3433\n- codecombat/aether#159\n\nAs an aside, I've heard the new interpreter is aaalmost ready, so it is up to you whether these PRs are even worth taking a look at. It was fun to put them together, and I've had over 90% of the code for them laying on my machine for a few months, so it was not really much trouble to put these PRs together.\n I read through the pull requests; some very clever things in here. Rob beat me to it with getting the interpreter finished, though, which gets us the same things in a different way without having to rewrite each built-in function. It's in internal testing now and will be enabled for everyone soon.\n Nice, I'm curious to see this working.

I am not fully sure if this is an \"issue\" or not but I was wondering if there is any other fix for it or if the way I did it is likely to cause any issue for me in the future (if not, I would love to be able to contribute this as a temporary solution in installation docs in case someone else has a similar issue!).\n\n<b> Finally ran : </b>\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8417980/8314317/9b527aea-199d-11e5-95a5-f59f83f87cd9.png)\n Okay!

I have removed \"tempThis\" and \"this\" from the code.\n  Shouldn't this issue be closed ?\n  It had to be done! Sorry it took so long... Life happend...\n Hello, @flowabuse! Thank you for contributing. Could you sign our [CLA](https://codecombat.com/cla) so that I can merge your pull request?\n @nwinter, can you merge?\n  it happened in simulations after 20-60 minutes of running or big levels like \"Sacret statue 7\" after couple runs.\nTested in ie and crome on defferent computers.\n it's about 300-1500mb per tab. don't look like leek....\n How often are you seeing this kind of problem these days?\n  When i trying to defeat Glacian in Cavern survival - after 20-30 seconds my hero begins to act very strange eg. running into walls and doing not he must to do. did see this bug with other players.\nSome time (if i change code) Glacian becomes untouchable - no orces or  my skeleton wants to attack him until timeout. it begins in 40 seconds and last till 120.\n  Super simples PR. But I was playing the game in pt_BR, and would be nice to have this translated.\n done\n  I can do this. I'm unfamiliar with the contributor process, so how should I go about adding them?\n  I just fired up Haunted Kithmaze and my eyes were assaulted by (feasted on?) this\n(also: Forgetful Gemsmith, Second Kithmaze, but not the other levels in the dungeon.)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/8323317/efa7eb40-19ff-11e5-8591-51bc699f03fd.png)\n\nI exited, never entering the levels to leave them untouched...\n I think someone made a nice patch so that this doesn't happen any more.\n  Made some changes like mentionned in the commit message\n @nwinter, can you merge?\n  Fixed now that AnnouncesLoop doesn't do anything. Well, maybe fixed for other reasons.\n  I have the sound turned off for CodeCombat (via the icon in the top-right corner) -- however, the welcome sound (_\"[whistle] codecombat\"_) is still played sometimes (even if just partially) when I open the browser with a tab including a level (http://codecombat.com/play/level/level-name). It also happens if I reopen a closed tab. Probably the page starts playing the sound before it checks the settings or there is a delay for some reason.\n\nIt happens both in Firefox (31.5 ESR) and Chrome (42 64bit), OS: Windows 7.\n As this has been marked for newbies, it will be better to let us know which file handles the sound play and which file first executes and handles the sound call on any level. I looked at Level.coffee but couldn't find any relevant code related to handling of sounds.\nIt's difficult to debug for newbies when they don't have insights of the code combat.\n  I think this is just me.\n  As stated, added basic Ice Sheet surrounded by Ice Walls to the generator.\n  I have seen several empty patch diffs in various patch histories and never knew why . . . I still don't know what causes this but at I think I know why the diff is empty. The \"location/path\" for the change is wrong somehow.\n\nFrom the recent history for the level \"What In Carnation\" (WiC)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/8022741/9e1c6dea-0ca4-11e5-8238-76741b34ff8e.png)\n\nBetween the first (0.11) and the last (0.13) patches shown, it somehow figures out the correct location and so can do a diff. But the middle one (0.12) is messed up that so it can't do the diff, and so shows nothing.\n\n`Thangs :: Hero Placeholder :: Components :: Component :: Configuration :: Extracode` is what it said when I was saving my -referee- changes for 0.13. This was disconcerting enough that I reverted and redid my changes -twice- (with play testing), before going ahead and saving it to see what would happen...\n\nI could show other examples from WiC, but let us move on so you can see it is not just patches submitted/saved by me.\n\nHere is a default code example for Catsync and \"Grim Determination\":\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/8022807/35a905f8-0ca8-11e5-8258-336c2cbb00ee.png)\n\nThe proper location for default hero code is: `Thangs :: Hero Placeholder :: Components :: Component :: Configuration :: Programmablemethods :: plan :: Languages :: {language}`\n @nwinter If it's about Thang order, then one could sort the arrays based on ID after they've been fetched for showing the diff but before the diff has been calculated.\n\nI remember having visions of changing all the arrays to objects (key being the ID). But that fix/migration would be more trouble than it's worth. But as a general rule, objects work better for diffs than arrays.\n  For example:\n\"Hero Placeholder | Components | programming.Plans | worldEndsAfter\" states \"When not null, ends the world this many seconds after this Thang finishes its plans.\"\n\nThere is a drop down box with which to choose \"null\" or \"number\". If you choose \"null\", it works as expected. Choosing \"number\" and \"1\" works as one would expect. BUT, if you choose \"number\", and \"0\" the world does not end zero seconds after the plan finishes. This is one of those conceptual cases where \"zero\" is not \"null\".\n\nThis should either be changed so the code works as described or the description changed so that it reads \"null or zero\". Since the choice to choose \"null or number\" is given, it would seem that the intent was to have the world end zero seconds after Thang finished its plans (zero does not equal null) if zero was chosen. Having mentioned what would be the preferred/intended method, the question(s) becomes can the way the database was set up actually handle this distinction and how many levels were set up wrong (used zero when null was meant)....\n Submitted patch to Plans: Changed description of worldEndsAfter to match how it works (0===null)\n\n[patch accepted, closing]\n      Continuing to add more localization as I go along.\n     signed.\n  Translated many strings\n Hi, @rohmunhoz!

A beginner will expect that `while True:` does the same thing as `loop:`.\n\nThe solution would be to add a new `nextFrame()` function that makes the magic explicit:\n\n```\ndef nextFrame():\n    self.wait(0.066) # seems to be the current frame length\n    return True\n```\n\nInstead of `loop:` the standard could be `while nextFrame():`.\n\nWhy is this a problem? In January someone ask for help to debug an issue that comes from this error:\nhttp://discourse.codecombat.com/t/python-while-loop-runs-infinitely/2407 nobody helped the poor guy. The error is non-obvious enough that forums users don't spot it. \n\nUser who are expecting normal python ask themselves whether this is really python when they see `loop` instead of `while` and `for`:\nhttp://discourse.codecombat.com/t/python-coding-question/3853/4\n Your first forum-example is trumped up. His problem would not have changed by adding any sort of loop around his code, and he specifically states this.\n\n\"While nextFrame()\" would require the explanation of \"frames\" to happen in the Kithgard Dungeon, long before a knowledge of such things would be of any coding benefit. (as well as conditionals, etc. see below for when these currently appear)\n\n\"A user expecting normal python\" [prior knowledge] is not the target audience of CodeCombat...\nHaving said that . . . For the languages at CoCo lucky enough to have been blessed with a coco-yielding-loop, maybe there should be an explanation that \"loop\" is not a normal language construct but used at code combat to simplify the learning of coding. I doubt the eight level a beginner has encounted, and three levels before the introduction of variables is a good place to introduce conditionals (currently the fourth Forest level, or twelve levels later) and full on loops (currently somewhere in the desert)... (a comment in the \"Haunted Kithmaze\" level where \"loop\" is first used would be, at least, a good start in covering this issue (loop not a normal language construct).)\n Let's look at the first linked example:\n\n```\ne = self.findNearest(self.findEnemies())\nwhile e.health > 0:\n   self.attack(e)\n```\n\nThere are two ways to get that code correct:\n\n```\ne = self.findNearest(self.findEnemies())\nloop:\n    if e.health > 0:\n       self.attack(e)\n    else:\n        break\n```\n\nor \n\n```\ne = self.findNearest(self.findEnemies())\nwhile e.health > 0 and nextFrame():\n   self.attack(e)\n```\n\nWhen testing around I sometimes found that self.attack() needs nearly no time to execute and can lead to a infinitive loop. It doesn't seem to do this always.\n\n> \"While nextFrame()\" would require the explanation of \"frames\" to happen in the Kithgard Dungeon,\n\nNo, the level could just tell the user that he has to write `while nextFrame():`. It doesn't have to explain the details. It doesn't have to explain anything about why that line works. It doesn't even have to allow the user to use any other while statement as long as he has only 'Programmaticon I'.\n\nApart from that the `loop;` magic violates the zen of python which says: `Explicit is better than implicit.`\n\nPS: Python is just discussing to add a `async for` loop (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/). \n Maybe you should try reading the post and not pulling code out of context to support your own theories:\n\n---\n\nThe following code results in an infinite loop, even though the selected enemy is clearly dead. \n\n---\n\nThe fix for his problem is NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LOOP, but fixing of the updating of the loss of enemy health.\n\nSo that is most of your post.\n\nattack(something) --shouldn't-- be part of an infinite loop, ever . . . --shouldn't-- . . . temporary glitches not withstanding.\n\nWell, if you want to not explain things you just introduced then there is no need to change \"loop\" or explain that it isn't \"real\" python................. (but you are asking for it by \"while nextFrame()\" ?? what does that mean? at least \"loop\" does what it says and says what it does. It loops, If you want to complain about black-boxes then don't ever try to introduce python \"for\" loops, with out lots of explanation.\n\nThis is not a \"Teach pythonic python\" site. This is a teach PROGRAMMING site, you choose the language to learn PROGRAMMING by using. You keep asking for the site to teach idiomatic python, PERIOD.\n I agree that adding a `self.nextFrame()` method would be more Pythonic, and certainly better for more advanced programmers. The reason we added `loop:`, though, was based on difficulties raw beginners were having with super basic syntax and infinite loops, and although it does have some big downsides, I still think it's worth it for how much easier it is to do loops early on.\n\nMaybe if we were going to do another campaign that moved a bit faster for older players, we would test out a `while self.nextFrame():` approach instead. For now I think the next step is to better explain somewhere around where loops are introduced that they are syntactic sugar that's not part of Python.\n I also get slightly bothered that Python is the default programming language but the lessons are not taught in a Pythonic way.\nDon't get me wrong, CodeCombat is awesome and I find the \"structured\" way of programming pretty efficient for teaching as well -- it just strikes me as odd that the default programming language was not from the broad C-family.\n\nEither way, seeing as the Python-to-JS compiler currently used in CodeCombat seems rather limited, it most likely isn't suitable for teaching the Pythonic way. I'm also not sure whether it wouldn't be too complicated for beginners, although I've heard good stories about students learning the Pythonic way before being exposed to C-family languages.\n\nOh, sorry if I derailed the thread too much. :stuck_out_tongue:\n\nBack on topic, `loop:` introduces quite a degree of magic that is not really part of the programming logic, but `while self.nextFrame():` may be too confusing for beginners.\nI agree on explaining that `loop:` is syntactic sugar intended to ease the learning is the best approach for the time being.\n We are just going to make `while True:` act like the current simple loop does, with the automatic yielding of one frame if no blocking action is taken. Any other `while` condition won't trigger this yielding behavior. So it's still magic, but it works the way the player would expect (unless the player is super advanced) and prevents bad infinite loop errors. We'll work on our autocomplete and error hints to repair damaged `while True:` loop syntax as we see what happens with it becoming harder to type.\n I think hidden magic of that type is very confusing. A player who's code works when he writes `while True:` but where it doesn't work with `while 1==1:` will be highly confused.\n So we'll handle that with responsive error messages or something. It's honestly not nearly as likely to come up as either 1) someone thinking that `loop` is not real Python/JS or 2) someone getting confused by the concepts involved in `while self.nextFrame()`.\n\n`loop` is already nominally equivalent to `while True`, `while 1`, `while 1==1`, etc., but I've never seen anyone just decide to use one of those instead inside CodeCombat.\n @ChristianKleineidam I believe @nwinter means that any loop that does not perform any `yield`ing would implicit yield at the end. E.g. `for` and `do-while` would also be affected. Is my assumption correct?\n No, that would mess up a lot of code, like when you looping over a list/array of coins to find the most valuable one\u2013your code would suddenly take one extra frame per coin. This is evil black magic to only apply when it's `while True:`, which is very unlikely to happen in an inner loop that's not supposed to take an action. (I couldn't think of a reasonable example of when you would want to do this in CodeCombat.)\n I see, makes sense. Though, in that case, you would most likely want to add the magical yield only to `while True:` loops that do not contain a `break` statement.\n\nPeople moving the break condition to inside the loop is quite common. E.g.:\n\n``` py\nn = 0\nwhile True:\n    n++\n    # do something\n    if n > 3: break\n```\n Ah yeah, that's a good extension of the heuristic! I think that anyone who knows how to use `break` will either 1) just write the loop as `while n <= 3:` here instead or 2) have some more complicated condition that depends on what happens in the world leading to the break\u2013in which case there is probably a blocking action in there anyway.\n\nReally, the exercise would be to come up with breaking code that would actually be applied in a CodeCombat level\u2013not necessarily the best way to do something, but one that at least sort of makes sense to some player doing it. Eventually I had come up with this crazy example:\n\n``` python\ndef commandFollowers():\n    # Iterate through friends between 1 and 2 times to either defend self or find a healer and defend it.\n    friends = self.findFriends()\n    friendIndex = 0\n    healer = None\n    timesIterated = 0\n    while True:  # needs to not yield\n        friend = friends[friendIndex]\n        friendIndex += 1\n        if not healer and friend.type is 'paladin' and friend.canCast('heal', self):\n            healer = friend\n            self.command(friend, \"cast\", \"heal\", self)\n        elif friend is healer or friendIndex is len(friends):\n            if timesIterated or not healer:\n                break\n            else:\n                friendIndex = 0\n                timesIterated = 1\n        elif healer:\n            self.command(friend, \"defend\", healer)\n        else:\n            self.command(friend, \"defend\", self)\n\nwhile True:  # used to be simple loop, needs to yield\n    self.commandFollowers()  # doesn't block\n```\n\nBut that's pretty out there...\n Yes, complex conditions that need to be tested inside the loop represent an use case.\n\nI believe the more common use case would be simply (ab)use `break`.\n\n> I think that anyone who knows how to use break will [...] just write the loop\n\nYou're assuming that everyone will write code in the most conventional and optimally readable way. Given that the vast majority of CodeCombat players are beginner programmers, I believe that would not be the case.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a learner to get addicted to certain language constructs right after discovering them (e.g. moving the break condition to a `break` statement). Of course, most often this is not good practice, but it takes a while (no pun intended) until they master these constructs and know where and when to apply them correctly.\n\nAnd yes, if I recall correctly, I used to be a `break` abuser at some point. :smile_cat:\n  User feedback:\n\n> Hi, my password is not working correctly, therefore I have askd to change it but the system sent one and did not work, so I asked for another one and it did not work either, and I asked for a third one and it did not work.\n> I am wondering what am I supposed to do about it, so that the password works again.\n  Added more Swedish strings. Going through them as I find them in the game (and translate some other things in those sections).\n  This is my first post in the issue tracker, so please bear with me.\n\nThe link labeled \"Mac and Vagrant Setup\" on \nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup:-General-Information\n\ndoes not really point anywhere. Perhaps we can remove this link for now and made a new link pointing to https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup%3A-Mac. \n\nThe link labeled Mac on the main github page https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat points to the same place, i.e. nowhere.\n\nOf course we could also just wait until somebody makes some content for the Vagrant + Mac setup if that is the preferred way to do this. But I feel that a dead link on the main github page is undesirable.\n I agree, @jacobakkerboom. I can fix the link to go to https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup%3A-Mac, but there are dead links on that page too. For instance, the link \"Vagrant tutorial\" at the top is also a dead link. \n\nAre we planning to have a Vagrant description for OSX specifically? There's already https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup%3A-Vagrant and although that has some Windows-specific jargon, it should be able to be transferred to an OSX audience fairly easily. \n\nI can write up a Mac-specific Vagrant tutorial if that's what's needed, but it looks like we just need to clean up the links and better utilize the resources we do have.\n  It seems like it's impossible to play The Geometry of Flowers without having brought a separate ring.\nBoth ring slots need to be filled to play the level and that doesn't make sense.\n I would guess that the issue is that the requirement for the level is \"right-ring\" ring of flowers, but if you have no rings the ring of flowers defaults to filling the LEFT-ring slot (the ring of speed defaults to the right-slot.) I believe this is because the slot order in the rings components is right,left for the ring of speed and left,right for the ring of flowers . . . so either the hand-ring requirement needs to switch or the order on the ring of flowers needs to switch...???...\n@nwinter which is preferable?\nI have submitted a patch to the ring of flowers switching it to \"right,left\".\nEvery time I tried to test it, something seems to override the change I have made, I even tried changing what the ring does to no-test-avail...???... (patch is order change only)\n I'm also experiencing this issue.\n\n![codecombat-about_to_equip_ring](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1155602/7706402/3e9b7a9a-fe18-11e4-888b-84109c15cbbd.png)\n\n![codecombat-ring_equiped](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1155602/7706407/42cc03fa-fe18-11e4-9478-b622a10c2f69.png)\n\n@Vlevo I think it shouldn't matter which slot the flowers need to be on.  It should only matter that the required ring is equipped.\n @Painted-Fox What you think or what I think doesn't necessarily matter.\n\nWhat matters is how it has been coded.\n\n[edit]\n\nHmm, so you got the ring in the \"right\" slot, but it won't let you in . . . hmm, I'll go look at that again, I thought it was happy for me like that (two rings to get it in the right spot, then remove other ring...)\n\nOr is this after the patch? and it automatically goes in there, now. if so then :frowning: but as I said I couldn't test it so, thanks for testing it. Yup, just tested myself, it goes into the right slot but the game still requires that the left slot be filled.\n\nSo, if I were a betting person, I'd put money on the code only checking the right slot if the left slot is filled. Making a \"right\" hand default ring and/or a right-ring-requirement be a \"you must have two rings\" requirement.\n\n@nwinter Please remove my patch and switch the level-ring-requirement to left ring instead of right ring (or someone could rewrite the requirement checking code to check \"properly\"). (the level-requirement I don't have access to change, or I'd probably have done that first, but now we know.)\n @Vlevo Can you point me to your patch, please?  Or point me to where these checks are being made? I'm curious to see the code.\n For my patch I went the easy route and changed the item in the game (a database change). Unfortunately this didn't work. I don't know where in the code that runs the game this check is made (or I wouldn't have needed to make my \"betting\" comment I'd have looked.) :frowning:\n\n(I assume that would be here in this repository somewhere...)\n There's one more problem with the required items logic regarding rings here: you can equip any two rings and the \"Play\" button will be enabled, not requiring you to necessarily equip the Ring of flowers.\n\nLooks like the \"unequipped due to restrictions\" logic referenced [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/0df6da7efa3df9ff6cd0e65133ff31923a9a0ee8/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L436) is not kicking in for rings.\n It is actually worse than that...\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/8394760/b61ae802-1d04-11e5-9c6e-28820440c261.png)\nIn other words, it knows it needs the ring of flowers, but accepted a different -single- ring....\n\nOnce upon a time, were there only two rings . . . one for the right slot and one for the left?????\n I'm taking a look at the [inventory modal code](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/0df6da7efa3df9ff6cd0e65133ff31923a9a0ee8/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee), it looks like the current logic regarding required items will accept any item in the slot which is not a restricted (blacklisted) item for the level.\n\nI can see the reason behind this logic choice, this makes it easy to accept a \"better\" item in that slot, as you just have to not blacklist better items instead of whitelisting all the valid ones -- e.g. the Kithgard Gates level requires the `tarnished-bronze-breastplate` but it allows you to use any other \"better\" armor as there's no restricted/blacklisted armor items.\n\nWithout major changes to the code, an idea would be to blacklist all rings except the Ring of flowers in levels which require the Ring of flowers (similarly to how all swords are blacklisted in levels which require a hammer).\nThis doesn't seem like a good idea though, seeing as if all the other rings are blacklisted then you wouldn't be able to equip them in the other ring slot.\n Perhaps a better approach would be:\n- When there's a required item for a given slot, whitelist all valid items for that slot in the [`requiredGear` items array for the given slot](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/0df6da7efa3df9ff6cd0e65133ff31923a9a0ee8/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L433), thus requiring one of the whitelisted items to be equipped in the given slot.\n- Remove the \"[accept any equipped item as long as it is not restricted](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/0df6da7efa3df9ff6cd0e65133ff31923a9a0ee8/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L436 %28blacklisted%29)\" behavior.\n- Similarly to the point above, patch up the `requiredToPurchase` logic removing the \"[equipped item is not in `allRestrictedGear`](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/0df6da7efa3df9ff6cd0e65133ff31923a9a0ee8/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L107)\" bypass.\n\nThe plan above should definitely fix the ring issues (together with #2868 which allows required rings to be equipped on either ring slot).\n\nHowever, it may also add a lot of burden when adding new items, as they might have to be added to a bunch of whitelists -- I'm not sure how much of a problem it currently is with the blacklists approach.\n\nHence I'd like to get some feedback on whether this sounds like a viable plan before spending too much time into it.\nI wonder whether there is a better way around this? Perhaps special-casing the rings would be better, as the current logic seems to work decently well for the other item types.\n @nwinter makes sense. I'll think of something if I have some spare time tonight.\nMeanwhile, feel free to comment if anyone has suggestions.\n  1.Modify some wording error\n2.Translated some items\n  Also corrected a few spelling mistakes.

And Mad Maxer is very frustrating haha\n  Examples: homepage, teachers, clans.\n We usually use nanoscroller for this; maybe it's not hooked up here like it should be on some other pages?\n This seems fixed in `direct.codecombat.com`.\nPerhaps worth noting that this fix did not propagate to the BR CDN yet.\n I haven't noticed this bug anywhere, should we close this issue?\n Fixed somehow.\n  line 4: According to [1], \"Leid tun\" was actually an accepted spelling between 1996 and 2006.\nline 839: Imperative form [2]\n\n[1] http://www.korrekturen.de/wortliste/leidtun.shtml\n[2] http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/beitreten\n   Sure, I just did so.\n    I Thought there was an issue about this but I couldn't find it...\n\nIn the Level Editor - If I click on one of the Thang Components in the Components List, the screen is redrawn with the \"'Back to all Thangs' button\" having been shoved up permanently out of view.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/7334587/278b6156-eb55-11e4-9f94-88839137b73b.png)\n   Off course :p\nIt's ok\n  I've been working on some algorithms that do preprocessing at the start of a round, and they're rather computationally intensive. I'm thinking of some possible ways the \"infinite loop\" detection could permit more expensive code. Currently, I'm doing `self.moveXY(self.pos.x, self.pos.y)` periodically, as a heartbeat of sorts, because it causes the smallest increment in game time AFAIK.\n- The option to continue evaluation for another timeout period\n- An option to extend the timeout period by a user specified amount/multiplier\n- Programmatically get the number of cycles until a heartbeat needs to occur.\n- Automatically advance the game time after a certain number of cycles occurs, like an automatic heartbeat. This would need a way to stop simulation (and not just playback).\n- Multiplayer simulations permit a much higher threshold (or maybe it already does?)\n I'm using self.pathClear to do a bucket fill of the reachable map area, and\nthen doing another pass to relax the boundary. I'm planning to use the data\nfor risk avoidance. It's actually not that much work, but... my laptop\nperformance etc etc... I never get real time simulation anyway. Which is ok, cause that's not the primary source of fun for me.\n\nIf you're interested, I can share the code. Maybe you can tell me if I'm expecting too much. The page does crash in my browser occasionally when I put it through its paces.\n I was also wondering if one of the nicer sense rings offers map data. Something to look forward to. :)\n http://pastebin.com/Qtf7nvfP\n That would be optimal. This is pretty much a hack to do just that.\n\nThough, I'm sure I'll come up with other ways to have massive code. 8D\nOn Apr 27, 2015 3:04 PM, \"Nick Winter\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Ah, I see.

Upon arrival, she stood there on top of the coin doing nothing.  This happened in both Cloudrip Brawl and Sarven Seige.  I assume that the peasant should be able to collect gold for me, but it isn't working.\n I'd guess it is because they don't have inventory.Collects\n   Should be done, struggled a bit since your link was for the admin page but\nI used https://codecombat.com/cla and that seems to have worked.\n\nCheers!\n    User reports losing progress after updating their email address.

I am able to login and logout. The levels are unavailable.\n  While setting up the project, i came across this when i ran SCOCODE.bat. I tried executing bower install but it didn't help. I found this code 'bower init' which tells whether you have a bower in the directory. Try updating the things manually from git bash and it works !\n  There should be a leaderboard button as soon as we click Play, before entering the levels. It will be better if placed beside the achievements. \n  The IDM catches all the sound files in game and tries to download them while playing the game. Its like a while(1) download loop. There should be a way to fix this!\n  Vector.toString changed to accept precision parameter, defaulted to 2. Allows more natural display of small or normalized vectors. removed non-functional useZ parameter.\n    - Arryn\n  - Charge?\n- Okar\n  - Radial stomp? (A cleaving-bash?)\n- Illia\n  - Harden? (Some sort of movement speed reduction + damage resistance that lasts a duration?)\n- Zana\n  - AoE Regeneration on the ground?\n  - A charm? (Temporarily switches enemy's team?)\n- Ritic\n  - Blink (short-range teleport) behind enemies?\n  - Vanish (Hide like Naria...)\n- Nalfar\n  - Zombies?\n  - Skeletons?\n- Usara\n  - Freeze/chill slow effect\n  - Meteor...? Drops from a high-z onto a target.\n  - Chain Lightning!\n  - Water elementals\n Hmm, abilities could (possibly) depend on intended class.\n\nArryn, not sure, could be melee or ranged.\nOkar and Illia, scream melee.\nZana, wings + melee doesn't seem like a good idea, so ranged or wiz. \"namespace\" aside she screams nature/insects\nRitic, ranged or wiz.\nNalfor, \"necromancer\" seems wizzy but ranged with some undead/shadow type abilities could be cool.\nUsara, hmm, well, with a name/title like that she **must**  be melee... :wink:\n\nI tried to avoid weapon/item ability/effects but a couple slipped in. I started out thinking of each one separately then realized that there are some abilities which would work for more than one of them, just differently flavored.\n- freeze/slow: Ritic - cold, Zana - plant/bug control, Nalfor - undead hands reaching out of the ground, Usara - magic chains...\n- AOE damage: Ritic - via cold (many possible forms, cone of cold, Ice/Hail-storm like a small Goldstorm but damage), Zana - plants/bugs, Nalfor - bones jutting out of ground (could be left as a hazard), Usara - magic duh. (actually, this one has already been used: Pender's manablast)\n- Hide has been used so I'll go with a related but different ability: Obscure vision - in the can't get a target lock sense, (protects self/area would essentially be hide, so) on enemy to stop their targeting iow, Blindness: Ritic cold mist, Zana bugs, Nalfor - blanket of darkness, Usara - well, not much you can't do with magic... (animation? cover targets head, ice, bugswarm, darkness, magic particles,...)\n- short range teleport: Zerien mentioned blink under Ritic but I like Shadow Walk for Nalfor better. Flit for Zana (flies to fast to be seen for short burst), of course any magic user or being (Ritic?) could \"blink\".\n- \"teleport other\": Nalfor going with the shadow thing, magic is magic for the others. By power rating? move a bunch of munchkins or a brawler out of the way (or your own troops for that matter). \n- Repulse - Similar to slow but strong enough to cause movement away from the hero. Ritic - freezes ground and slides opponents away for x time. Zana plants/bug pull/push away.\n  - Could even be programmed as an extra \"away from\" Ritic/Zana movement vector, iow head towards and you move away, move away and move away faster (could be used to speed up friends).\n- Heal/Regen via corpses (removes corpses from game or reduces hp of the corpses if raised.) Nalfor or Zana. But wait, she's not a necromancer . . . one word . . . Fertilizer... :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: \n- Distraction/Confusion: bugs/cold/ghosts - can't walk straight, attack for seriously reduced to zero damage or just can't attack.\n- Doppleganger (decoy/uncontrolled or controlled, attacks?) Ice, Plants, Undead, Magic. Time and/or HP based. \n\nFor the melee types:\n- Berserk (blocking action): extra attack speed and damage for time on random enemies within 2-3 \\* attack radius? (attacks each of the three closest enemies in facing direction once each, moving as necessary?)\n- Charge (as mentioned by Zerien) and use the new \"Dash\" ability + knockback (from Nick on hipchat) . . . Arryn: \"like being run into by a stonewall\", instead of the other way around. Okar: No one expects a short legged muscle bound beefcake to be fast, but with charge he becomes a juggernaut.\n- People like cleave, so a hero based cleave (1/3? base weapon damage no modifiers) (Long Sword is ~55% base no modifiers, Master Sword is 100% base no modifiers)\n\nIndividually:\n\nArryn\n- first thing that jumped to mind (especially for a ranged Arryn) would be temporary \"stonewalls\" (what can I say, it's the namespace), movement blockers, . . . the computer may only be inconvenienced in the time to go around (unless Arryn is fully surrounded), but other players&minions could end up bumping them until the walls despawn (like bumping the \"cage\"). Put walls around an area that doesn't include the hero and this falls into the freeze/slow category above.\n\nIllia\n- Shield ability that functions regardless of action\n\nOkar\n- he's a big guy - extended attack range\n\nZana\n\nRitic\n\nNalfor \n- Summon a couple of skellies (from ground instead of corpses).\n- Control Undead : Stealing control would be cool on levels with them, but therefore of limited use.\n- Deanimate Undead - Drop'm like the corpses they are. Like Control Undead it is cool but limited.\n\nUsara \n- See almost all of the above . . . as mentioned: not much you can't do with enough magic.\n- Anti-magic field or \"Dispel Magic\". As field no one else's magic works in the area (including things trying to enter, so shaman orbs, goldstorm, etc would cease at boundary (as opposed to bounce)). As \"Dispel Magic\" either a) removes old and stops new on target or b) causes target to be unable to cast/use magically abilities (including wand/staves.) (bash/cleave/throw are combat not magic abilities)\n I just created a movement.Blinks component with my understanding of it.  Allows thang to jump instantly to any position that is in line of sight and within blinkRange.  Worked on patching in Paladin Heal functionality to magic.CastsHeal.\n\nThis requires that the commanding unit (the player,) be given access to either the command (with the Boss Star #,) \"perform_heal\" or \"heal\" such as:\n\n```\nthis.command(paladin, \"heal\", this);\n//or\nthis.command(paladin, \"perform_heal\", this);\n```\n\nAs well, I implemented basic AutoCasts functionality for it, finding the first injured friendly to heal.\n  I'm pretty sure JSHint used to warn on this... But it seems to no longer be the case.\n      Translated a few more lines, mostly about player subscription benefits.\n  log on server:\n\nGET / 200 3ms\nGET /stylesheets/app.css 304 0ms\nGET /lib/ace/ace.js 304 2ms\nGET /javascripts/vendor.js 304 0ms\nGET /javascripts/aether.js 304 0ms\nGET /javascripts/app.js 304 0ms\nGET /javascripts/app/locale/en-US.js 304 0ms\nGET /images/pages/base/modal_background.png 304 1ms\nGET /images/level/popover_background.png 304 1ms\nGET /images/level/code_palette_wood_background.png 304 1ms\nGET /images/level/code_editor_background_border.png 304 1ms\nGET /javascripts/app/locale/en.js 304 0ms\nGET /images/favicon.ico 304 0ms\nGET /javascripts/app/views/HomeView.js 304 1ms\nPOST /db/analytics_log_event/-/log_event 200 1ms\nGET /images/pages/base/logo.png 304 1ms\nGET /images/pages/base/nav_background.png 304 1ms\nGET /db/user/55255fb6eb583dd2764b4827/achievements?notified=false&_=1428514274122 200 2ms\n 1.remove the node_modules,\n2.update the npm to latest:\n\n> apt-get install python-software-properties\n>  apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\n>  apt-get update\n> npm install\n> sudo npm install -g brunch\n> sudo npm install -g bower\n  translation: classes, contribute\n  translation : about II. ladder II\n  translation: ladder\n  translation community,classes I\n  I tried a few different things when building my zero-sum entry and this ended up totally ruining my plans.\n\n``` lua\nlocal function whatever()\n    self:foo()\nend\n\nwhatever() -- nothing happens, not even an error.\n```\n\nthe behavior is the same for anonymous functions and functions stored in tables, too.\n\nHere's my entry trimmed to just item pickup, for demonstration:\n\n``` lua\nloop\n    local ideas = {} -- hang onto all possible actions for prioritization\n\n    -- work out best nearby item to pick up, save it into ideas\n    do\n        local items = self:findItems()\n        local bias = -5 -- bias away from most valuable, helps to avoid enemy.\n        local nearest = self:findNearest(items)\n        local best_nearby_item = nearest\n        for _, item in pairs(items) do\n            if item.value + bias > best_nearby_item.value and\n               self:distanceTo(item) + bias < self:distanceTo(nearest) and\n               self:isPathClear(self.pos, item.pos) then\n                best_nearby_item = item\n            end\n        end\n\n        if best_nearby_item then\n            -- cc doesn't have table.insert\n            ideas[#ideas+1] = {\n                name = \"get_item\",\n                importance = 1,\n                action = function(self)\n                    self:move(best_nearby_item.pos)\n                end\n            }\n        end\n    end\n\n    table.sort(ideas, function(a, b)\n        return a.importance > b.importance\n    end)\n\n    -- do whatever is the most important (in order of priority)\n    -- note: there's not enough info about how actions get executed by code\n    -- combat... it'd be really nice to have better docs.\n    for _, ideas in ipairs(ideas) do\n        ideas.action(self)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nI had various mysterious issues when putting together my entry, too, some things I had to work around with pcall and some errors that just vanished when I rearranged stuff in a functionally identical way.\n Firstly, thanks for really kicking the tires in on lua!\n\nThis isn't actually a problem with lua specifically (though you will see it more often) but a problem in all languages in code combat.  What happens is this:\n\nWhen code combat compiles your code to be run, it has to make a lot of changes to it to support \"blocking functions\".  What is going in is Aether is trying to do a bunch of hackery to basically make something like `coroutine.create()` work in javascript.  It does this by detecting what functions could possibly call a blocking function and rewrites those functions as generators.  \"Could possibly call a blocking function\" is defined as contains any call expression.  Aether keeps track of the functions it has rewritten into generators, and when it comes across the call-site of such a converted function, replaces the call with a call that will also enumerate the generator.  This usually works, but if you pass the function (that has now been rewritten as a generator) by reference into a function, inside that function we don't know it's been rewritten.  Because of this, we don't rewrite the call, and calling the generator just returns to us an iterable, resulting in the function not really running. \n Here's an example in javascript that would have the same problem.\n\n```\nfunction double(a) { return a*a; }\nfunction double2(a) { return double(a,b); }\nthis.say([8,6,7,5,3,0,9].map(double).join(\",\"));\nthis.say([8,6,7,5,3,0,9].map(double2).join(\",\"));\n```\n\nIt will say `[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]...` the second time, because the return value of `double2` is going to be a generator, not the real return value.  `double` works because it contains no call expressions, so it is not converted to a generator.\n This is still an issue for Ace of Coders, here's some more test cases: https://gist.github.com/shakesoda/80b69243b98018510c9e\n\n(at least this time I'm not late to the party, so I can work around it...)\n I found out that local function doesn't work, yet function does in lua.\n Should be fixed with @basicer's new Esper interpreter.\n   Actually I'm running in IE. It creates a warning (not an error so not the end of the world). Not sure why you are seeing nothing with this change, perhaps an incompatibility with whatever browser you are using.\n\nAnyway, comments in HTML are not '<!' but '<!--' (and '-->' not '>') - as per all other comments in this same file.\n These are conditional comments read by Internet Explorer.  The ones you're suggesting we change need to remain downlevel-revealed.  These weird comments are specifically addressing IE9 issues, which are noted above each conditional comment block.\n\nMore info: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512(v=VS.85).aspx#dlrevealed\n\nYour changes will specifically comment out required script file includes on non-IE browsers, which is why Nick didn't see anything load with your changes.\n\nFeel free to file an issue or submit a pull request for any warnings you're seeing in IE.

Could that have something to do with it? If it can't resolve a reference, that would explain why workingSchema isn't being what it ought to be.\n\nI'd suggest having these examples in the client tests. There's already one in [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/test/app/models/CocoModel.spec.coffee#L154-L176). Add more with the Programmable and HasEffects examples and that could make it easier to understand and debug the problem, and keep it from coming back. With that you could reduce the bug to its essence. It sounds like it's a tangled web right now that's dependent on what's in the db. Start by taking the raw `@attributes` and `@schema()` values and putting them into a test and then having the test identify what output you expect that you're not getting. Then reduce the values from there.\n\nWhat are your tests, exactly?\n Fixed with a combination of 652c523 plus a [treema issue](https://github.com/codecombat/treema/commit/b325fa814af192151df100085b8b55ad25f2a92b) where `walk` wasn't properly passing `workingSchema` for array items.\n  Translation account_settings\n  translation : suscribe II, choose hero\n  fix wrong translations.\n @Imperadeiro98  Yes,I have signed it just now.\n  Translation : share progress, signup, subscribe\n  +1\n Eager to know when this new feature can be available\n+1\n +1 :-)\n A bit of work to implement, but make each level \"lock\" the equipment used for the solution. If you want to sell the equipment, you must rerun all levels with the new equipment. A \"submit all\" button which checks all levels one after each other will be nice.\n\nIn this way you can sell inferior equipment made obsolete by your new one, but you can't sell heroes or level required equipment.\n Hi all,\n\nI started work on this and created the sell button UI. Check it out so far:\n\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"codecombat - sell item button\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312320/13241366/34bd4d92-d9b8-11e5-9cae-96075b3c0bda.png\">\n\nYou'll notice that the Simple Boots intentionally don't have a Sell button because they don't cost anything.\n\nIt looks maybe a little too similar to the Unlock button, so I was thinking of changing the color or the position (moving it to the left side, maybe?). But moving the position might be a little inconsistent since I'm guessing we would want the action to be in the same place. At the same time, the button UI might be fine as is since there is no Gem value next to it.\n I like it, I think changing the color to orange or yellow or something would be a good start.\n @nwinter Thanks for the feedback! I believe the following tasks are now complete with the latest commit:\n1. Decide on a buyback percentage (40%)\n2. Add sell button UI\n3. Add buy back price\n4. Add model logic for tracking sold items, total gems now including sales, etc.\n\nHere's a pic of the standard purchase UI:\n\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"codecombat - purchase item\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312320/13342724/b8c4b7e0-dc12-11e5-903b-4e2b758fc4b0.png\">\n\nAnd here's a pic of the selling UI:\n\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"codecombat - sell items functional\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4312320/13342725/ba57ec4e-dc12-11e5-9ae9-51b604b6d2ad.png\">\n  Translation of tips II\n  Translated: Leaderboard\n  Addeded some translations.\n  How do we deal with if statements within if statements?  \n  commanded minions switch to move action, but never switch back to attack when commanded to attack something out of attack range.\n\nthey need a say, \"move-to-attack\" action.\n  If a hero is hit with a mana-blast while it is building its program crashes and the hero just stands still.\n\nI have done it to the AI and another player did it to me.\nWhen it happened to me it gave me an error saying 'Cannot read property 'z' of null'.\n  Maybe a feature but IMO the blowback on this weapon rather weakens it.\n\nEven from one hit kills the hero ends up chasing a body across the room.\n\nI suggest killed enemy die before the fly, at minimum.\n Is that the name?

This pull request in particular, makes it a lot easier to use, allowing the client to get to the website.  I'm not sure which OS Alan is using, but on Windows it works well.\n\nThe user will only need to install vagrant + an ssh client of their choice.  Then it should be as simple as `vagrant up`.\n Note that they'll only need an ssh client if they wish to access the box once it is up.\n I'm mostly using a Mac, but did some testing on Windows as well. I installed Git for Windows and got SSH that way.\n\nI am running into one issue, at least on Mac, which is that brunch doesn't appear to pick up my changes if I make them on the host. If I SSH into the VM and make a change it gets picked up right away.\n\nSo it's not quite at the point where it's easier for a novice user, but it's close. Certainly it's easier for me as someone who knows more about VMs and Linux than about Node.\n Ah, we definitely need to make a note of that - I reckon most (at least some) will have only installed Git_hub_ for windows, which does not include SSH.\n  translated some phrases\n  In the Oasis level in the desert you can move left as long as there is an enemy through the wall and hang out until they're all gone.

Thanks! :smile: \n\nImmediate problem was fixed, but its still unclear as to why problem occurred in first place.\n I think I'll close this issue unless anyone else gets this problem.  It's somewhat linked to some other \"not getting reward\" issues.  \n Unsure as to the methodology of closing issues in this group...i would of kept it open @popey456963 .  Seems like a bug to me, that needs to be fixed. ill look into it, Thanks to @Zerrien though.\n We have a bunch of other issues where items don't get added when they should do.  I'm unsure whether another one would help or not.  This appears to add very little information, but, incase it does help, I'll reopen it.\n  This bug is probably a feature right now, because the poll patch reviewing is really janky and errorprone, so let me handle the poll patches\u2013else we may lose votes or other translations.\n  I love that if I want to add a specific point to my code I simply have to shift-click to get the position:\n\n{x: 72, y: 40}\n\nBut for it to work, it should be:\n\n{\"x\": 72, \"y\": 40}\n\nSeems like this should be a simple fix, but I'm not sure where to go about making the change.  I'm also not sure if the formatting is different depending on the language.  I know this is what it needs to look like in python.\n in clojure I get the same result {x: #, y: #}\neven though it should be {:x # :y#}\n Wasn't code submitted to fix this? (I still see the bug)\n  Something is causing the \"infinite loop\" error to pop up, even though the submitted code exits.\n\n``` python\n# An ARRAY is a list of items.\n# This array is a list of your friends' names.\nfriendNames = ['Joan', 'Ronan', 'Nikita', 'Augustus']\n\n# Array indices start at 0, not 1!\nfriendIndex = 0\n\n# Loop over each name in the array.\n# The len() function gets the length of the list.\nwhile friendIndex < len(friendNames):\n    # Use square brackets to get a name from the array.\n    friendName = friendNames[friendIndex]\n\n    # Tell your friend to go home.\n    # Use + to connect two strings.\n    self.say(friendName + ', go home!')\n\n    # Increment the index to get the next name from the array.\n    friendIndex = friendIndex + 1\n\n# Go back and build a fence to keep the ogres out.\nself.moveXY(25, 30)\nself.buildXY(\"fence\", 29, 30)\n\nself.say(\"All done\")\n```\n Can you check the JS console on this for any interesting messages about why it's showing the infinite loop error? I am not seeing it with your code, so it might be something that only happens on certain random seeds, or something else.\n The last line shows up briefly after the error dialog appears. Maybe my laptop is just too slow.\n\n```\nModuleLoader.coffee:84 lib\nvendor/aether-clojure\nvendor/aether-coffeescript\nvendor/aether-io\nvendor/aether-javascript\nvendor/aether-lua\nvendor/aether-python\nvendor/coffeescript\nvendor/d3\nvendor/difflib\nvendor/diffview\nvendor/three\nvendor/treema\nviews/account/AccountSettingsView\nviews/common/SearchView\nviews/editor\nviews/modal/ModelModal\nviews/modal/RevertModal\nviews/play\nModuleLoader.coffee:85 loaded 19 files, 1435 KB\nCocoModel.coffee:90 Populated defaults for Level Sarven Savior in 92ms\nVM716:198 Assigned power 700 to wave undefined with difficulty 0\nVM716:198 Assigned power 600 to wave undefined with difficulty 0\nLevelLoader.coffee:404 World has been initialized from level loader.\nCocoModel.coffee:90 Populated defaults for User in 18ms\nGod.coffee:70 Umvelinqangi: Let there be light upon Sarven Savior!

I saw this once but then couldn't get it back. (Maybe it's really easy and I'm just wishfully thinking that this is a corner case.)\n I can do that too. If my spell palette doesn't fit (or is close). I can scroll down... (even when full screen)\nzoom in until your text is big enough that your palette doesn't fit.\n:) not a bug . . . FEATURE!!! :D\nI wish my editor was that big...\n I have 1650x1080 resolution and a lot of methods as you can see. I just load the page and see this. \nI didn't try to reload :/\n Could we turn this bug into a feature?  As in, make a nice scroll bar or something, maybe add a pretty background below?\n I just did it, accidentally... \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/7175330/7840f476-e3d0-11e4-82f7-98a2a85b3648.png)\n\nNow to see if I can do it on purpose . . . Yes I can.\n\nLevel with lots of code: I Click on level, Click Play, Click Play, once the loading screen resizes the background graphic, then I change my screen size:\n- click {F11} to go/leave fullscreen\n- click Restore Down / Maximize\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/7175749/54a9e248-e3d5-11e4-84f1-af5344aef24e.png)\n\nChanging the screen size, once in that state seems to fix it (I didn't test all possible permutations)\n  Shouldn't we keep it if we need some other item to show off?  It seems a waste just to get rid of it when it's likely we'll be offering another item at some point.\n I need to modify the code to keep around some of the logic for showing off items and highlighting levels, so let me figure it out.\n    Hello,\n\nThis bug doesn't happend everytime : \nI start a level (the bug happend with different level, but I have only seen it on level with limited item), then I click on play -> the inventory panel open.\n\nI try to click on an already equiped item and ... nothing hapend, the right panel doesn't show information about the item. In fact when cliking on already equiped item, nothing happend.\nBut not equiped item work perfectly (I can see information and equip them). Last information, if I equip an not equiped item, I still can't see information about it, but I can unequip it with double click (doesn't work with equiped item since the start).\n\nHere the console log :\n\n```\nThangType.coffee:459 Trying to determine whether Bronze Shield should be a silhouetted item, but it has no gem cost.\nThangType.coffee:459 Trying to determine whether Simple Sword should be a silhouetted item, but it has no gem cost.\nThangType.coffee:459 Trying to determine whether Sundial Wristwatch should be a silhouetted item, but it has no gem cost.\n```\n It was on google chrome (sorry to forgot to mention it). I tried to reproduce again on chrome but I couldn't. May have been fixed by something or may be a nasty bug requiring specials conditions.\n\nAlso : still got the error in the console log, so these errors are probably unrelated.\n Sounds like it might have been a temporary connectivity issue. Will reopen if we see it again and get more info on it.\n  Old translation was \"Encaisse\" which means takes damages instead of takes time.\n    Choose_hero translation.\n  \u0131 get the same error dude \u0131 subscribe 2 times did they get my money twice or didn't get any ?

I was doing weird things for that ladder for the Singapore tournament, where I had unsubmitted the playtesters' sessions. I've resubmitted now, so it should be working again.\n\nLet me know if it was another ladder you saw this on.\n  I was very impressed with this project. I am Japanese, so I want to play Codecombat more Japanese speakers.\n\nI rewrote about page better for us.\n\nThanks\n @Imperadeiro98 thanks, I agreed.\n  Fix Issue #2550 \n  The translation should be \"Sintaxis\"\n![2015-03-21-003304_1366x768_scrot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11511250/6763593/f33637dc-cf61-11e4-9b12-c9f6373739bd.png)\n  Diplomat, nav, modal, not_found blocks and slogan!\n  I interpret the above as: if the user enters only their e-mail address in the Managed Subscription e-mail box, direct them to the personal subscribe experience (otherwise reachable through the first subscribe button at the top of the page). Is that right?\n\nWhat would be the expected behavior if the user enters other e-mail addresses in addition to their own in the Managed Subscription e-mail box?\n We should notify the user if any of the email addresses they enter is their own.  It's more likely that they will include themselves in a list of email addresses to subscribe.\n\nAn easy way to notify the user would be a simple popup or dialog that says something like 'Please use the Personal Subscription' button above to subscribe yourself.'\n\nTrying to subscription yourself via the Managed Subscription method is currently blocked on the server side: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/payments/subscription_handler.coffee#L446\n We also display the wrong price when someone tries to subscribe themselves.  E.g. subscribing yourself and a friend shows $17.98 in the Stripe dialog, but only charges $9.99.\n Sponsored subscriptions deprecated now, so we don't need to build this.\n  finished the essentials and I took my time to check the translation, I wasn't active since I worked onmy projects now the steps remaining are\n1) finishing the miscellenious translations (teachers, community, editors etc...)\n2) fixing the right to left problem (probably by just using the mechanics of the text editor differently[reorganizing brackets, dots, commas, language mixed sentences and so on...])\n3) altering other files to support sending the subscription message according to user's gender since there is no way to representboth gender in the same form (Could you please direct me to the files that I need to edit to send the message?)\n I am reffering to the parents subscription e-mail, I thought about adding a simple if statement that sends the right message according to the user's gender variable but that means that I need to add an extra few lines for translation on each of the language files so it won't break with other languages, but in alot of languages the gender differs so I think it would be helpful for a lot of translators.\n The \"send your parents an e-mail so they can purchase a subscription for you\".\n @ChaosCat I wish we knew the user's gender more often, but unless they logged in from Facebook or have been playing for more than four days, we do not know. There's really know way to do it without knowing the gender?\n @nwinter , I am afraid there is no way to do it generally unless I add a backslash with each gender split which I tried and it looks really awful it would also double the amount of text for no real reason.\nI though about 2 solutions <i>(the first one can act as a place holder while the second is written in comments until it's complete)</i>:\n\n<b>1)</b> Adding an option when clicking the <b>\"send parents a message\"</b> button to select the gender form of the message that you wish to be sent.\n\n<b>2)</b> Adding a gender option to the game that can be changed through registiration for new users and/or profile settings for existing users which will be used for a lot to make the game more comfortable and also will make it easier if you plan releated future updates.\n\nit can also affect the defaults for each gender like the hero gender, the NPCs etc... (but this is just suggestions for later)\n\nP.S: I am glad to help at anything I can here, although my programming speciality is in Java and C++ languages, I do have a basic knowlege of web languages like PHP and Javascript so I think that with some documentation I can manage to pull off this addition (but I am afraid I can't help much with the design of the dropdown menu and the buttons/radio boxes because of my insufficent knowlege in HTML and CSS.\n Hmm. We have a poll for asking the user's gender, but we find it much more important to ask about age on the first day, and don't want to be too pushy with the demographics before this email is sent (after level 4). Plus, there's always the option not to answer one's gender, or for transgendered players. I really think that even though it looks bad, we'll have to go with something gender-ambiguous.\n  Updated FI translated resources\n Hello!\nYou should uncomment category-tags too (like this one: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/2538/files#diff-5cafb34ab3e8ddc241b3f2c074ad20cdL96 and others) if you translate some tags in category.

Maybe a video will be worth 54 in this case.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBuMjCNe9kA\n Looks like for the affected items, the call to docs.fetch is returning with an empty list, suggesting an issue with the underlying database?\n Submitted thang patches to all the broken boots.

I have a hard time hitting the arrow from the forest to the desert, because it thinks I am hitting \"Siege of Stonehold\" instead.\n\nSorry, that shouldn't be it, since it says \"Locked\" and not \"Play\" like mine did. Have you redone \"Clash\" since then? (sometimes that does the trick, re-getting the permission)\n We found it. Workaround: `localStorage.clear()`.

Also i think, that you'll want to uncomment translation of \"back\" and \"continue\" tags and \"share_progress_modal\" category.\nupd2. Also there is a missed \"#\" symbol at line 329.\n\nTo fix all of this you can make new commits to your brunch - they'll be incuded to pull request\n you welcome, I'm sorry about the errors..\n  Noticed it again.\nWhat happens is that the player is prompted to go to the store and buy the item. Then, the game asks to equip it, and the page reloads. After this, the tip 'Equip the new breastplate to win the fight.' appears.\n Yeah, you are right. Cleaned cache and it works properly now\n  IE9 is not supported any more.\n  Which is used in a lot of levels, and immediately causes default code examples to fail due to the lack of this convenience method.\n\nIt also requires much more verbose code instead of just one method call (2 nested method calls instead of 1).\n Would a good solution be just to keep the normal findNearestEnemy() function?\n I expect so.  I believe the same problem exists with the self.findNearestItem() method, as well.  That comes up even less often in the early levels, but does happen periodically.\n I think it's the only time we show how to send the result of a function to another function.  I'll go speak to other people about this.\n Hmm. I do want to encourage the progression from less-flexible to more-flexible methods, and keep the total number of API methods down. I think that if we had a way of just rewriting the default code to use `this.findNearest(this.findEnemies())` wherever it had `this.findNearestEnemy` if you were using the higher-level glasses, that would solve most of the problem and still let me encourage players to learn how to transition to using the more powerful APIs.\n Does this do the opposite as well?  More-advanced glasses to the basic functions?\n  Fix Issue #2428\n\nSo, how it works.\nDev change some line in en.coffee. \nIf he add {change} in comment of this line:\n- this {change} will be added to all non-en files for this line\n- {change} will be removed from en.coffee\n\nIf there is no comment in non-eu - \" # {change}\" will be added to line\nIf there is {change} in non-eu already - no doubles of {change}\n\nOld mechanism of syncing comments from en also isn't broken - if there is a change in comment in eu and {change} in non-eu then new_comment + {change} will be added to non-eu\n\nTotals: what is needed from dev? add {change} to en.coffee when dev change line. thats all.\n\nIf it will be merged to master, @popey456963 or @nwinter could you update devs guide for this? and some anounce would be great.\nAlso @Imperadeiro98 please participate in the discussion :)\n I can change {change} to {needs update} or whatever if needed\n I'll update the wiki when this pull request gets closed :)\n\nEDIT - Don't think anyone actually checks the diplomat wiki page.  Thinking about changing en.coffee\n Hmm, looks like the RegExp is going to need to handle some more crazy stuff:\n\n```\nSyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /#?    cla_prefix: \"Damit \u00c4nderungen gespeichert werden k\u00f6nnen, musst du unsere Lizenzbedingungen (\".*{change}.*/: Unterminated group\n```\n I think it's cause of ( at the end - need to slash it.

(If the other issue wasn't closed, sorry, close this one, I just can't find it).\n\nOf the 93 games I've currently played on the human cavern-survival ladder, I've won 64 and lost 29.  Out of these 29 lost games, I've lost 24 to Lativa - the second best player on the ladder (while I am but 103).\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qTOocob.png)\n\nNote on the image how Lativa is found 24 times.\n\nI doubt this is meant to happen, playing a quarter of my games against one person seems to give one of the people a huge advantage (24 free wins) whilst the other person a huge disadvantage (24 definite loses).\n  - Running Chrome Version 40.0.2214.115 m\n- Window 7 - 64 Bit\n- Using Book III and I am clicking on the items.\n- Please ignore the code, I was changing from coffee to python because it was bugging.\n  ![](http://i.imgur.com/rbeXvZq.jpg)\n Note, this occurs on all zoom levels, and on different resolutions.\n\nAlso, stays through to simulation:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/0RwZXV6.jpg)\n\nAnd in victory screen\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/6z9PX70.png)\n  Somewhat similar to issue #19 however, possibly, easier to implement.\n\nHow about we have a \"notes\" page\", that allows the user to keep useful pieces of code, that might be usable on all levels.  Something similar to the notepad in [untrusted](http://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/).\n I think that rather than encouraging copy-pasta (lord knows how many interns I've broken of that habit), it would make better sense to tab-iffy the code window with Main and Library tabs. The Library tab would persist between different levels and be pre-loaded before running code in Main. The correct place to introduce this is shortly after functions are introduced. \"I feel like I've written this before. Perhaps I should put this into my library since I might be using it again in the future.\"\n  I was trying to add the changed loop statements in conjunction to issue #2422  but some characters either do not have anything to be edited yet or does not load yet.Not sure if it's only my computer or not.\n  Added a new loading message/tip to encourage people to contribute to CodeCombat. Message added in English, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n  This fixed issue #2430. The tabs now look ok in Russian \n\n![russian](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3805149/6428185/3ff4ab3a-bfdb-11e4-825b-ae10c0d98275.png)\n Thanks to you - i've seen a mistake in ru-translation :D\n\nAlso - is it normal that text at 2nd, 3rd. 5th and 6th tabs is not verticaly centred?\n Probably it is normal that text at those tabs is not vertically centered, because if you choose English as your language then you can also see this behaviour.\n  On some level i discovered that you can do\nthis.moveDown(2)\nto make two down moves. but there is no info for that function argument in the methods' tips.\n Which levels were you able to do that?\n I'll try to find that level tomorrow. \n I remember, there was a big blue fireball, that want to hit you, and you need to \nloop\nRight(2)\nDown(2)\nto escape the dungeon. And there was a chest in the top line. \nIt's a kithgard campaign with js language. \n    Doing some work..\n\nnow i see a problem at 337 line:\n tip_hate_computers: \"Eso es la razon sobre la gente que piensa que odia las computadoras.... \nThe right way: \"Esa es la raz\u00f3n por lo que la gente piensa que odia las computadoras....\n Thanks @FedericoTomas!\n  I added 32 names in multiple \"Thang\" categories\n Ok, it should be signed now. Let me know if you need anything else, or if I didn't do it right.\n  What we have now: en.coffee as original text and a plenty of translation files for different languages.\nWhen someone adds a new line to en - it's ok, next propagination and line will be synced in all files.\nBut when someone _change_ line it en - nothing happens.\nThe latest example - removing HoC-related text from the \"teachers\" tab - a lot of strings was changed. And now diplomats need to re-read all of strings in both en and i.e. ru files or blocks to sync the translation.\nSo... Is it real to make some script that will seek the history of en.coffee on git/github and add comments to lines or comment the whole line?\n if the script will add comments to lines, we need to update the copy-i18n-tags.coffee - AFAIK it removes all comments from lines\n Being stupid here, couldn't the editor say that this line has been changed in en, and a program with Regex or something finds that, and adds a note to the end of said line to all other files?  Like:\n1. Editor changes en.coffee\n   `slogan: \"Learn to Code by killing ogres\" //change`\n2. During propagation, regex finds all versions of said comment\n   `[/]{2}change`\n3. When it finds said change, it removes it\n   `line = line - change //if only it was this simple` and `lineno = x`\n4. It then goes to every single file in the directory `for file in dir:`\n5. And appends the line `text[lineno] = text[lineno] + \"//change\"`\n6. Now, we keep the old translation, and tell the diplomats to change the new one.\n\n| Lang | Before (en) | After (sp) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| EN | `Line //change` | `ChangedLine` |\n| SP | `l\u00ednea` | `l\u00ednea //change` |\n\nThe downside is obviously that they have to trek back to en.coffee and see what the original words are, but that isn't very difficult.\n and need to exlude deleting of that //change from non-en files - let diplomats delete this manualy when they correct the translation.\nthis is a good idea, but we face the \"human factor\" - you need to manualy add //change to en file. but i think it's a good price for this\n I just used this and it works well, except I had to modify it to not add `# {change}` to lines that hadn't been translated yet. Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but it seems like [this](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/e6cf298ed3fa216256caba4417ef41f0aa8352b1#diff-78766be23221abb773927bbd42a4cc7dR49) should have done it. Instead, I have to run the i18n propagation twice, and then it works.\n\nCan you take a look and maybe mod it so that I only have to run it once, and it won't add the {change} tag to untranslated lines?\n Sure, I'll check it. Funny, I specially added support of inserting changes in translated lines, don't know why :D\n\nAlso is it normal that some translations in vi.coffee was dropped? \n  A couple of classmates and I want to try working on this issue. We're having some trouble finding the relevant files. Could someone tell us where we should be looking?\n Awesome! Here they are:\n- [main-account-view.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/account/main-account-view.jade)\n- [main-account-view.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/account/main-account-view.sass)\n- [MainAccountView.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/account/MainAccountView.coffee)\n I'm not sure how the account page should be changed. Do you think something like this would look fine?\n![template](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14229728/11570451/4d10ddd8-99c5-11e5-925a-cdbb2654479b.png)\n Hmm, I don't think mirroring part of the profile page on the account page is the right answer, because you already have to click an /account breadcrumb from one of the subpages to get there, so you were possibly just looking at the profile page, and it'd be redundant. This page should serve mostly as navigation. Maybe tiles more like /contribute would work better here?\n We made an account page similar to the one on the contribute page, what are your thoughts on this? The boxes are there to show how much relative space we can use. We can add a background image to each box if provided and we can also add a description to each box (if needed).  \n![accountpage2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14229728/11615324/6b1c4af2-9c2b-11e5-866f-d44fb4fafe9b.png)\n Sure, beats what we have now. I don't think we will have art for this for a while (the artist is busy drawing a ton of other stuff), and these are pretty self-explanatory, so I don't think we need a description.\n We were able to make the log out button but we are having trouble finding the file or code to make the button work. Can you give us any tips for making the button \"log out\" the user?\n Add an event subscription to [the view code](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/account/MainAccountView.coffee) that calls the view's `@logoutAccount()` method, sort of [like this](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/core/RootView.coffee#L25-L25):\n\n``` coffeescript\n  events:\n    'click .our-logout-button-class-name': -> @logoutAccount()\n```\n Hey @nwinter, just realized we never really thanked you for all the help. I like we shouldn't have needed to ask for some stuff like finding files if we just looked a little harder. Again, thank you for guiding us.\n    When I run codecombat on localhost and I select the first level for Python and click Play I get this error in the loading screen: \n    Error: ReferenceError: seed is not defined\n    Check the JS console for more.\nThe loading screen freezes and I can't load the level.\n Closing for now; I'm pretty sure this has to do with an old version of the code being loaded for localhost.\n  The lightning bolt spell that comes with the lightning twig weapon instantly reduces any enemy to 0 HP.  I did this to a 2900 HP Tharin on dueling grounds and reduced him to 0 HP in one shot.  It does the same to any enemy in the single player missions.  An enemy reduced to 0 in this way does not die, instead it plays the death animation, then continues to move and attack while laying on the ground, and cannot be killed.\n Fixed it.\n  Submitted patch for:\nHaunted Kithmaze\nRiddling Kithmaze\nHack and Dash\nPatrol Buster\nEndangered Burl\n\nThe Second Kithmaze - it has comment only\nBreakout - no default source code\nDueling Grounds - it has comment only\nKithgard Gates - no loop in default source code\nKithgard Brawl - it has comment only\n Submitted patch for:\n- Touch of Death\n- Shrapnel\n- Bonemender\n- Coinucopia\n- Hold the Forest Pass\n Submitted patch for:\n     - Back to Back\n     - Ogre Encampment\n     - Woodland Cleaver\n     - Peasant Protection\n submitted patch for \n-back to back\n-Rich forager\n-drop the flag\n-Unfair support\n-Thunderhooves\n-Medical attention\n-sarven sentry\n-decoy drill\n-Shine getter\n Submitted patch for:\n1.

I started installing the whole project locally to\ncheck for these things offline first. \n\nThanks,\nnin\n I can shorten the headline and the 3500 Bonusedelsteine, But The Problem would remain because the second entry is hard to make any shorter and still be nice to read.\n\n![german_subscription_](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11194369/6422187/ff2cb7ba-bed5-11e4-8913-e6c73da5db2b.png)\n\nI watched #2408 and think that would also be a good idea.\nIf I am allowed to, I could change these layout things and check them in in the future. I will of course try to make it all fit and still sound nice. I was going to install the codecombat for checking on my machine, but the npm takes up all the ressources on my computer when using windows. Hard to imagine... I got time on sunday and will fix my linux. So if you do not mind and I could test locally, I would also change the layout and commit that in future. \n\nThanks,\nnin\n I just noticed that there is still the $ sign in the price field. Another contributer translated that.\nShould it stay dollar or would it be the same in euro? Then I would change it along with other things.\n Okay, seems I do not need to change that for #2409.

This happens sometimes when loading levels recently; I'm not sure what's going on with it yet, but it's 1) intermittent and 2) not specific to IE.\n\nBut it should make it so that you can't open the level at all, not so that you can play but without real-time playback working... hmm.\n IE9 is not supported any more.\n I can reproduce this freeze during real-time play on Win7/IE11, but not Win8.1/IE11. On Win8.1/IE11 it runs very laggy, but does run (and I once had a \"ghost-flag\" that wouldn't go away).\n  This fixes issue #2388 \n Thanks for the tip.\n  Added input-changed trigger to toggle all.\n   @Imperadeiro98 I'll finish them and add some more but you may merge if you wish.\n Sure, no problem :)\n Looks good for a merge now @Imperadeiro98 \n  wondered why Herotype isnt translated o.o\n  Many Minor Updates + FInalization :D\n o.o just noticed it has failed built ... wonder why it wont re-attempt and how (maybe?) do i attempt to rebuild it ?

After a short time, the parser detected that he doesn't now `atta` and suggested `this.attack`. Correct would be `@attack`\n Hi this is my first bug. How can i fix this ? \n Failed to click on the comment button, sorry...\n Which code editor is this ? How do i open it?\n The ingame code-editor. The one where you press Run or Submit after you finished coding.\n I'm unable to reproduce this bug, can you help @J-F-B-M ?\n Closing until we can reproduce.\n  Check for number of remaining elements in currently deleted Thang's Name , if its zero then delete.

Instead of deleting the User object, now I only remove all the properties except for _id and anonymous. I don't add a `deleted: true` property, because probably `anonymous: true` property can also be an indication of a deleted account.  \n\nHowever, I don't understand what you want to see with the \"HTTP 410\" thing. So for example, if you go to the page http://codecombat.com/user/thisaccountdoesnotexist, an error page should be displayed ? \n @nwinter I have added a `deleted: true` property to a deleted account. I also have modified some parts like the way you said. Thanks for your comments.\n  Some translations and french grammar corrections.\n  a minor update for he.coffee\n Glad to help, by the way is there a way to see the percentage of translation through gitHub? (The site hasn't updated yet) and a simple way to track the progress would be really helpful\n Ok thanks.\n  It's working (except in CoffeeScript), although a bit slow. Might have been a memory issue Nick.\n  Onhidden function was resetting volume to 1.0 in case volume is not defined. In case volume is not defined, means that onShown has not been called and hence volume should be same as  current volume.\n  second update done\n    Can't currently view your own solution.  Saw this on Dust.\n  I'm going to close since I haven't seen crashing in a while. There may or may not still be memory leaks, but we'll need to do a fresh leak investigation to find them.\n    some updates to he.coffee\n    Fix issue #1832\n  Saw in level Medical Attention.\n I have verified that while adding ZatannaSnippet , the doc for scattershot has no field named snippet. Thats why its not added into autocomplete suggestions. \nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L412\nI am stuck with adding snippet field into docs for scattershot. \n I have submitted the patch for adding scattershot snippets for all supported languages. \n  No script error when passed a target object.\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-17 at 3 00 30 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/6239204/5da90ece-b6b6-11e4-942f-6198aff349c0.png)\n Proposed a patch request that fixes shooting at a {x:, y:} position as well as allows the player to simply scattershot() 10 meters ahead of them.\n  At the moment I have know way of knowing how I stand up to the leaders unless I'm ranked.\n @nwinter can you confirm the top 20 are being served using the `getLevelPlaytimesBySlugs`? To me it looks like [these are the lines involved](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/levels/level_handler.coffee#L489-L515)\n The line numbers must have drifted over time; those are the correct lines right now.\n Oh that makes sense, I though git versioned those links in some way. Thanks\n  some of the translations were changed to a clearer/better form\n  I have just read and signed the CLA. I am glad to be a part of the project, it is very important to me to help more people start coding and localization is the first step.\n  Added getUserInfo function in User.coffee to which  returns information of current user.\n  Added 'Itachi', 'Madara' and 'Obito' to the set of ninja names.\n     That's awesome @nwinter :+1: I had some ideas which I would like to discuss with you at HipChat.\n  First translation session\n  Correction of spellings and new translations\n Done ;)\n        Also reduced the size for tbody data to fit properly\n You're welcome Nick.\n  How about ordering languages by ascending instead of this? It seems pretty random.\n\n![screen shot 2015-02-16 at 20 14 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7047431/6217859/a46acab2-b618-11e4-8e1b-63f41b1956e1.png)\n I think that it would be important to have languages ordered by popularity. E.g. if some Russian (as mentioned) goes to your site and have to sroll all the way down for selecting his language, he is not going to be much happy about that.\n Solid points here guys. Just throwing out ideas tho; how about a pre-selected top of, let's say top 5, and then alphabetical, divided by `---------------` or something. As a player from a country with not that many players, I might get the idea that my language is not present. Have used this approach previously with pretty good feedback from users.\n\n```\nEnglish (by populatiry)\nChinese\nRussian\n-----------\nAlbanian (alphabetical)\nLatvian\nNorwegian\nSwedish\n```\n\nAll this considering a smaller number of very popular languages.\n :+1: for @matifol's suggestion about having the top 5 languages at the top, and then the rest.  I also find the non-alphabetical (seemingly random) order to be quite odd! :)\n Yea, I think the @matifol suggestion for top 5 used languages and other ordered alphabetically.\n Just wanted to offer variant as @matifol did. And I think the \"5\" number for number of languages is just what we need. \n Yea, looks great.\n Hm... Alphabetical list looks strange a little, but if it like wiki does, it's OK. \nAlso we could change one list of languages to 3-4 lists, like translate.google.com does - it can resolve the scroll-scroll-scroll problem. \n  Hi!

Could you possibly link me to the commit? I'm curious about the fix!\n   @Imperadeiro98 ,yes I am!\n That's why I do this. \n  I witnessed my son's first lines of programming, and it was exhilerating.  And although it went beyond expectations (he coded the third to fifth level correctly first time without hitting \"run\"), I have a few gripes with the way the editor screen pops up.\n\nHe had never seen a line of code, not even _scratch_ or anything before, and a lot of things happen the first time you open the editor:\n- The hero starts to move\n- The progress bar starts to move\n- Code in the editor highlights\n- Yellow arrows pop up\n- blue pop-ups (translated) pop up.\n- a voice says to do this or that.\n\nIt all happens quite quickly, and it is a bit challenging (especially for non-English speakers) to keep up. Easy for a professional programmer to understand, but overwhelming for a child who has never seen code. In my opinion, I think it should be much calmer. Perhaps something more modal like this:\n- Nothing moves when you open the level, i.e. calmness.\n- The hero is highlighted, perhaps a spotlight effect used on the hero. No text is necessary.\n- A mouse click anywhere advances this \"slide show\". (The characteristic yellow arrow could be used to guide the user to click somewhere). The point is to ensure that the child sees the hero, recognises the hero they just chose in the previous screen.\n- The next thing highlighted is the editor window.  Also using that spotlight.  English-natives will easily read \"self.moveLeft()\". Perhaps the comments should say (localized) that \"moveLeft means the hero moves left a bit\" instead of the current list of goals.\n- Yet another click (anywhere on the screen) to confirm that the child has seen the code.\n- Then guide the child to hit the \"run\" button, (possibly using the yellow arrow), but now the modality is gone, allowing for exploratory behaviour.  I want to get the first-time users to hit that Run button, before writing any code.\n\nI think this would introduce the link between the hero, the code, and the run button, so that the child understands what's happening without any guidance, e.g. if the child does this on her own or if the parent is unfamiliar with coding.\n Yes, I think once you're past the first level, you've grokked it. After level 1, I think it's all pretty good up until \"variables\"-levels; they need some TLC too.  But a child that randomly hears about CC and ends up no level 1 will often not make it past the first level, simply because they don't understand the connection between the code and the movement of the character.\n I have had a similar experience, non-english kid, too much movement in the screen.\n\nI can't say I would do it that slow, but maybe a mini intro, in the interface itself, where the kid would see the connection between the hero and the code.\n\nAlso, they don't see the code as commands nor statements\n  Hi I am new here, i would like to work on this bug, can someone guide me through it\n I'm a newbie trying to tackle this issue, making some progress but wondering if someone can push me in the right direction.\n\nI have the patches view added: \n![selection_002](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10272301/6200800/6efdccf8-b456-11e4-9347-1fbc3a965670.png)\n\nHowever, it is not being populated with patch data correctly.\n\nThe articles patch view makes a database call like '/db/article/524c8cb26ee802556d00000e/?status=pending' to populate the patches list.\n\nHowever, when the same call is made for achievements it looks like this '/db/achievement/undefined/?status=pending'\n\nThe call that returns undefined is '@achievement.get('original')' ('@article.get('original')' returns '524c8cb26ee802556d00000e')\n\nThis is where I am stuck, I cannot trace the calls further than this. I am finding no 'get' method in article.coffee or achievement.coffee.\n\nEDIT: I have found that the 'original' tag is in the article schema and not the achievement schema. This is why it is not working. Looking into ways to fix this.\n\nAny tips would be appreciated! Also, let me know if this is the right place to be posting this kind of question.\n I am also having the same problem, as described by rmarren1, i found the get method in CocoModel.coffee, it returns the attribute from the model (i think so). When i opened my database dump/achievements.metadata.json i was not able to find any key value pair for 'original', whereas there was one such pair in articles.metadata.json. Can this be a database issue ?\n there is no object at  http://localhost:3000/db/achievement/'achievement-id'/patches\ninstead we get the json at  http://localhost:3000/db/achievement/'achievement-id'?status='status'\nthe json objects at article and that achievement are handled very differently, hence i suppose we need to write a different viewer to do so, can you guide me through it?\n I have the menu working, and all get requests are going through\n![selection_001](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10272301/6219807/5564ddde-b5fc-11e4-89be-45e347e16d99.png)\n\nHowever, I am not actually seeing any patches. Is something wrong, or are there just no patches in the database? I don't want to make a pull request until I'm sure it works.\n Don't know if this helps, but the after I make a patch just access the database, the patches show up.\n\ne.g. http://localhost:3000/db/achievement/5499ec66a88ecca974d501e6 shows\n![selection_003](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10272301/6222230/070b1d70-b61e-11e4-8f6f-e303093b4159.png)\n\nBut when I try to access the patches directly at:\n http://localhost:3000/db/achievement/5499ec66a88ecca974d501e6/patches\n\nThere is just a [ ].\n  Translated achievments, user, article, save_load, inventory, game_menu, some of play_level, some of general, rest of login, rest of nav\n  Just for the begining. Looking forward to complete translation ; )\n   Oh yes. You are right. I didn't think about that.\n      CodeCombat is unlike anything you've previously translated.  Prepare for some archaic phrases and out-of-this-world concepts. In order for you to work more efficiently, we're compiling a glossary of some of the more esoteric phrases and concepts. New diplomats should look up their glossary (or create it) to ensure that their contributions fit with contributions from other diplomats.\n\nFor example, a lot of the boards have humans and ogres in them.  The word \"human\" probably has a few different translations in any given language, and the feel of things is so much better if the same word is used for this concept everywhere.  In the same, but opposite way, \"ogre\" is quite likely to not have a translation, and the diplomat would be faced with choosing one of (possibly many) words for vile creatures.\n\nIf you start to see a lot of boards with, e.g., \"The Mirewood Fells\" or something, and it becomes a CodeCombat meme, you could add that so that translators could agree on how to translate it.\n\nI suggest a top-level i18n type called \"Glossary.\" Along with that would be a page where a diplomat would be able to see the current glossary for his language (the current i18n UI might suffice).\n\nFinally, the glossary should be populated with board-related things like gem, ogre, hero, Sarven. The entries would have to be tagged if they're a given name for something, or a species of beast or whatever, to help diplomats.\n\ne.g. on the page https://codecombat.com/i18n/glossary/objects (does not exist (yet))\n\n| Description | English | Translation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gem (awarded by game) | Gem | Juvel |\n| Hero (protagonist) | Hero | Helt |\n\nAnd perhaps on the page https://codecombat.com/i18n/glossary/places\n\n| Description | English | Translation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hilderbalad (in third campaign) | Hilderbalad | Hildeballade |\n| The Frozen Forest | The Frozen Forest | Den forfrosne skog |\n\nA cheat-sheet page where the whole glossary (all types of glossary) could be kept open in a browser tab (no-frills) so that I can \"ctrl+f\" my way around it, with my entire glossary would be very useful.\n    Translated new blocks and small fixes with You/you\n @Imperadeiro98 i hope so)\n   I don't know yet. I'll try to find the cause of it, but this quickfix solved the problem.\n    Translated some words and sentences into Vietnamese and Korean\n     How long before i18n changes hit the live site @Imperadeiro98?\n Ok, thanks! :)\n   Dratz. lots of double work here! https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/2261\n Ops, sorry. Didn't see. Guess I took for granted I was the only one working on this.\n Didn't seem that there was too much overlap, in fact :)  Someone should remove the \"no\" language.  The languages here are \"nb\" and \"nn\". \"no\" is deprecated, I believe.\n Good stuff!\nYea, \"no\" is probably no good. Like @mogsie says \"nb\" and \"nn\" are the ones being used. \"nb\" will be the most common one. \"nn\" is kind of a secondary written language.\n @nwinter:\nnb = \"Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l\", used in many populous parts of the country, including the capital.\nnn = \"Norwegian Nynorsk\", used in many other populous and not so populous parts.\n\nA windows (only Vista :( ) machine I have access to has \"Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l\" locale, and sends these Accept-Language headers:\n\nChrome/Windows: nb-NO,nb,no,nn,en-US  (with decreasing qualities)\nFF/Windows: nb-no,nb,no-no,no,nn-no,nn,en-us (also decreasing q values)\nIE10/Windows: nb-NO\n\nPretty sure a machine with \"Norwegian Nynorsk\" would see \"nn\" somehow first in the list. :)\n\nNow we need to find someone with the time to translate nn.coffee!\n\nHistorically there _was_ a no locale, but it was deprecated and removed by operating systems a long time ago.\n @matifol I'll do some post-merge cleanup. Some of  your edits were better than mine ;-)\n I think it's all redundant. We have it if we need it :)\n Thanks @mogsie, good stuff :-)\n    Kept all the old strings for future reference.\n Hi @Imperadeiro98! I did it just a few minutes ago. Please let me know if there are any issues.\n  The leaderboard view fits properly while scrolling down.\n  I have added more names to Names.coffee\n   Thanks!\n    Actualice un poco.\n Done my friend for 2nd time, i did it on december yet\n Haha, its ok!!

Seems that time is always the same if you succeed.  Love that there is option for high damage dealt.\n\nOther issues:\nSarven Road - Don't have to kill the scouts, can just haste to the end of the level.\n\nI'll add more issues as I find them.\n Is it possible to have a Most Gold Collected stat?  Mad Maxer Sells out would be cool that way.  (When hasted I can collect more coins than just the 3 gold)\n You'll need to clear out the old scores for Sarven Road as well.  I currently hold the best time and damage taken at 4.9 seconds and 0 damage.  I just cast haste and ran.  Was planning to kill at the end, but the level just ended.\n  So when I played minesweeper with Senick and 2000 health.  The mines seem to do damage of maxHealth/3.  Then I only get healed for 200 damage.

Edited some longer sentences reasonably carefully, also using the prefix/infix/postfix text. Made use of the word email more consistent, by changing most to email. Wiki says the official spelling is e-mail, so perhaps we should revert this, but I think consistency is most important. I suppose we should work together with our Belgian partners, but I have only looked at the NL version. Again, feel free to contact me. I will browse some more in the Dutch version to see if everything looks ok.\n  More strings to translate, heh) \n      [This replay](http://codecombat.com/play/level/criss-cross?team=humans&opponent=54885edf5c80aac606ad94d5) consistently results in the error:\n\"Uncaught Error: Specify a code language to create an Aether instance\"\nPer Nick this user doesn't have a submittedProgramingLanguage.\nseems like this shouldn't be possible, but we should also probably not be simulating users in this state.\n Haven't encountered this one\n  error in JS console:\n\nThere was an error fetching two games! {\"readyState\":4,\"responseText\":\"Couldn't select a random session!

So lets not make it easy to do that in other places.  How do you guys feel about disabling the AJAX caching globally?\n Looking at what this changes in chrome.  Primarily the behavior of /db/thang.type I think this is going to be a problem.  _sigh_\n  added some german translation\n  Submitted reasonably many translations. Did not look how the translations looked on my own server, but I did recognise most texts for which I provided a translation (so that for most options I had a good idea what their purpose was). This is my first edit, so I am not well aware of any unwritten rules about translating. \n\nI tried to be reasonable in using comments. For some things like the translation of subscriber (abonnee), running (uitvoeren o.i.d.) and equipment (uitrusting) some discussion might be nice, in order to have consistency. I have however refrained from using very long comments. I am actually not even aware of what the default action is when no translation is present, which I assume is simply to use the English version. I suppose the main purpose of the Dutch translation is to help children, so this is what I mainly had in mind. I think it may be preferable to simply use english terms for things like equip or submit or run. Feel free to contact me about subjects like this. I have reviewed some previous edits to see if my edits were in line with those and they seemed reasonable. A review of my edit would be welcome, it is always possible to screw up spelling.\n @Imperadeiro98 Great, thanks for merging! I am excited about this, I hope I can look at this again soon.\n  navigating to http://codecombat.com/play/ladder/cavern-survival sometimes crashes IE11 with an access violation.  This happens 100% of the time when running against a local server.\n Its a hard crash. see:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dgnXcc1.png\n\nFrom the event log:\nFaulting application name: IEXPLORE.EXE, version: 11.0.9600.17416, time stamp: 0x5452eed9\nFaulting module name: MSHTML.dll, version: 11.0.9600.17496, time stamp: 0x546ff2f9\nException code: 0xc0000005\nFault offset: 0x00204753\nFaulting process id: 0x2330\nFaulting application start time: 0x01d03f113f016c62\nFaulting application path: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Internet Explorer\\IEXPLORE.EXE\nFaulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\MSHTML.dll\nReport Id: 93be5668-ab04-11e4-bea9-74d02b0d8e11\nFaulting package full name: \nFaulting package-relative application ID: \n Is this still a problem?\n\nWhich OS version?\nIn a private browsing window?\n\nI don't get a crash on IE11 Win7, using a local server or against production.\n Please reopen if you still see this.\n  My current fuzzing setup fails 5% of the calls to `/db/thang.type/...` The frequently results in the simulator getting stuck at \"Setting up simulation\". A behavior I see somewhat regularly on the live site.  It would be nice if we could recover gracefully from Thangs failing to load.\n Closing unless this still seems to be a frequent problem with ThangType requests failing.\n  @nwinter Fixed 1. Part 2, I'd recommend creating middleware on the Campaign server model to have it run a mongo update query. Since the adjacentCampaigns property is an object, you can do something like { 'adjacentCampaign.#{campaignID}': { $exists: true }} for a query to find all Campaigns that are linking to the one that changed, and something similar for an update object.\n  Several translates\n This is done ! I've don't signed because i've already signed... with an other name : /\n  (Here a hero might have an attackDamageFactor of 1.8, so instead of doing 100 damage per hit, she'll do 180 damage per hit. Similarly for maxHealthFactor. We might want to show this in the inventory so that players know how much they'll actually get with the currently selected hero.)\n Hi! I would like to work on this bug, bug I don't know which file(s) I should be looking for.\n So the hero stats are currently used [in PlayHeroesModal.coffee here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/modal/PlayHeroesModal.coffee#L64), which gives them to [the template, play-heroes-modal.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/modal/play-heroes-modal.jade#L54-L59). Then they [are styled here in play-heroes-modal.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/modal/play-heroes-modal.sass#L193-L239). The stats get calculated [from ThangType.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/ThangType.coffee#L347-L389). So that works.\n\nMeanwhile, [in ItemDetailsView.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/modal/ItemDetailsView.coffee#L68-L70), [item-details-view.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/modal/item-details-view.jade#L15-L19), and [item-details-view.sass](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/modal/item-details-view.sass#L69-L93), we don't do anything with the hero stat multipliers (`attackDamageFactor` and `maxHealthFactor`) when we [display the item stats in ThangType.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/ThangType.coffee#L391-L463).\n\nSo we probably need to be smarter about the item details display. [Here's one suggestion](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/embroidered-griffin-wool-robe/4549/9?u=nick). As Vlevo points out, it gets a little complicated depending on whether we know we have a hero selected or not, but we can probably figure out some satisfactory logic on when and how to show the scaled stats depending on whether the player is strongly associated with a hero at the time, like maybe we do it when showing an ItemDetailsView from [InventoryModal.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/menu/InventoryModal.coffee#L172-L172) (the inventory screen) but not from [PlayItemsModal.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/modal/PlayItemsModal.coffee#L126-L126) (the item shop).\n My comments from the [related thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/embroidered-griffin-wool-robe/4549/14):\n- the percentage could be written next to the colored bars (on the hero selection screen)\n- Furthermore, the percentages could be marked with a star, so people would instinctly hover above it and see the text, e.g. that _\"hero gains ..% of listed armor\"_\n- On the inventory page, the base or scaled health/damage could be shown in parentheses, e.g.:\n  - HEALTH +140 (+100) or\n  - HEALTH +140 (base: +100) or\n  - HEALTH +100 (current hero: +140)\n- It could be added to the level loading screen hints, e.g.: _\"Note: armor and damage are scaled based on your hero's stats\"_\n    Update zh-HANS.coffee : \n1. add some translation for tips\n2. add some translation for subscribe\n Hi  \n   I signed the CLA as you say, you can merge it now.\n\n> On Jan 30, 2015, at 12:14 AM, Imperadeiro98 notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Hi, @scenix007 https://github.com/scenix007!

This appears to be a mixed content issue.\n This is happening because IE caches AJAX calls even though we put pragma: no-cache (this is arguablly correct behavior) https://github.com/yaur/codecombat/commit/13690cd8013f29a8f0222e31f7c9cd585c512afc prevents this\n If you are using jquery for the ajax calls (haven't dug in enough to know yet) you can do something like `$.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });` to prevent this globally.  This is probably a better solution than fixing it on a case-by-case basis.\n This problem seems to be fixed on IE11 Win7.

I think i was just making it too large for the place i was trying to put it.\n  We completed the Known Enemy and it shows in our profile as complete and we saw the Victory screen at the end saying that the Crude Glasses were unlocked.

I was nearly halfway across the screen calmly taking out ogres when a brawler nudges a sand-yak and causes him to take off after me.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5871697/599d62b0-a31c-11e4-8131-66f3ba081b20.png)\nI am Senick in the top left of the screen, notice the brawler in the bottom right surrounded by yaks.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5871709/7ab820d4-a31c-11e4-8273-3994896b405e.png)\nBrawler has bumped the yak causing 4 damage.

But the damage is done, death comes quickly!\n\nI'm not really sure what could be causing him to get aggro on me.  I am using the lightning stick to attack and previously thought maybe the lightning stick was causing damage outside the 37M range (this has happened before, but with yaks that were much closer to me).\n\nI will leave my code alone and not submit if you want to try to check it out Nick.  Not sure if seeing it happen will be helpful or not.\n Another instance of it.  I'm using the lightning stick and just caused aggro with this attack\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/6123067/4c09d028-b138-11e4-9799-0ce05d184369.png)\n\nDoes the lightning stick really cause damage that far away from the beam?  Seems to have hit the yak for 4 damage even though the beam is never closer than 12 or 13 meters from the yak.\n  After some investigation of why I was losing matches that looked like clear wins I think I know what is going on. For my user (Africanized Swallow)\n\n[This match](https://codecombat.com/play/level/multiplayer-treasure-grove?team=ogres&opponent=54884b90e6b7cda906c7561d) is reported as a loss but is a clear win, but [another match](https://codecombat.com/play/level/multiplayer-treasure-grove?team=ogres&opponent=547baad303f4e24905a9aa1e) that ran at more or less exactly the same time is reported as a win but is a clear loss.\n\nHow significant this is depends on which opponents score is being used to update the player's score.\n I thought maybe I'd come across a similar thing here:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5956476/42561724-a7e9-11e4-981b-9a6dc3fc934b.png)\n\nBut I checked all the other matches that are at the same time as this match and all came out as wins.  The two matches that are losses the other player had a red X the whole match until he died.\n\nI've also noticed that occasionally a match is listed twice in a row.  This only seems to happen when it is a loss.  Thus this error is magnified.  These are currently my only losses in the last 200 matches.  Earlier it was a different pair of losses that when I looked at them they came back as wins.\n      Translated some new lines\n  Long player names overflow poorly on user dropdown\n  new subscibe text added, was confusing to read codecombat does not want to make subsciptions in /legal\n I did accept the CLA yet.\n  In cavern survival it seems that things have changed so that you are no longer able to pass between the rooms, if you try you are teleported back to the middle of your room.  Unfortunately, you can still try to attack the doors.  If you attack the door closest to you, then try to attack the other door, you are teleported to the middle of your room, only to run back toward the door attempting to attack it again, this loop continues until someone dies.  Would be good if either you can't attack the doors, or if when you teleport to the middle your action is reset to idle.  \n\nAs it is if someone has the basic attack nearest enemy strategy, they will attack their door first, then most likely the other door will be the closest thing, so they will attempt to attack it, entering into the endless loop of running to it.\n  Do we need to truncate the name to one line, or adjust the background so as to clearly classify name from options\n![screenshot from 2015-01-21 14-08-08 cropped](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7155772/5833364/b50e4768-a178-11e4-84ad-163a4885da48.png)\n![screenshot from 2015-01-21 14-08-45 cropped](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7155772/5833365/b62d2632-a178-11e4-9a1c-cd1da64a21e3.png)\n picture1 will be a nice option, but i am not sure as to truncating the name to one line will be the same or not\n If the name scrolls on mouseover,would it be a usability problem? \n  Could we suggest that users use the inbuilt `Ctrl + F` function as a temporary function, until a more permanent solution is implemented?\n  Fixing the following error.\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n\u2002\u2002File \"setup.py\", line 26, in <module>\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002import factories\n\u2002\u2002File \"/home/divyanshu/codes/codecombat/scripts/devSetup/factories.py\", line 133\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002if distro == \"ubuntu\":\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n```\n\nWhen you try to install Dev enviroment following this guide: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup:-Linux The error above will raise.\n  Added some translations to the file\n Will do!

Here's some example code demonstrating different output from 4 ways to achieve the same result. Of the 4 options here only the function and the for loop seem to work as expected.\n\n```\ndef findNonMunchkins(enemies):\n    return [x for x in enemies if x.type != \"munchkin\"]\n\nloop:\n    enemies = self.findEnemies()\n    if len(enemies):\n        funcListComp = findNonMunchkins(enemies)\n        listComp = [x for x in enemies if x.type != \"munchkin\"]\n        listCompIs = [x for x in enemies if not x.type is \"munchkin\"]\n        forNotMunchkins = []\n        for x in enemies:\n            if x.type != \"munchkin\":\n                forNotMunchkins.append(x)\n        self.say(\"Function found \" + len(funcListComp) + \" non-munchkins.\")\n        self.say(\"Listcomp inequality found \" + len(listComp) + \" non-munchkins.\")\n        self.say(\"Listcomp is found \" + len(listCompIs) + \" non-munchkins.\")\n        self.say(\"For loop found \" + len(forNotMunchkins) + \" non-munchkins.\")\n    else:\n        self.say(\"BORING\")\n```\n\nI find it fascinating that wrapping `[x for x in enemies if x.type != \"munchkin\"]` into a function mysteriously makes it perform as expected. In theory all 4 list variables should be essentially the same, unless my relatively novice understanding of Python is incorrect. Also of note both of the unwrapped forms of list comprehension I've used here return undefined length including the form @nemoyatpeace suggested. Wrapping the `is` form does make it work as well.\n I'll reopen this until we decide whether it is still an issue or not.\n Here's a video demonstration of my results for the code in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/2113#issuecomment-77746946\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udhexXpJfRI\n \"if\" then \"[x for x in ...]\" seems to be the problem. see [here](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/list-comprehension-in-python-bug-or-anything-i-dont-understand/3361) for a post with small example.\n\ninterestingly, \"while\" then \"[x for x in ...]\" doesn't\n\n```\nself.wait(2)\nitems = self.findItems()\nf0 = [x for x in items if x.value == 3]\nif f0:\n    f1 = [x for x in items if x.value == 3]\n    self.say(f1 + \" ?= \" + f0)\n```\n\n(the \"if x.value == 3\" is only to produce small output, removing it doesn't effect the error)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/6987579/f370227c-da05-11e4-8b19-1d2d77caa527.png)\n\n```\nwhile f0:\n```\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11031492/6987601/12dc0874-da06-11e4-8be6-845bde962137.png)\n Hi,\nthis problem still persists and it is really annoying (I'm have been using if statements and list comprehensions quite a lot of in my code and I was always stupefied why it did not work as expected). Here is some minimal code for further illustration (which I used for kilthgard-brawl):\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    throwers = self.findByType(\"thrower\", self.findEnemies())\n    if throwers:\n        nearest = self.findNearest(throwers)\n        others = [t for t in throwers if not t is nearest]\n        self.say(others + \" - \" + throwers)\n```\n\nshows `\"[object Object] - Zara,Grel\"`, whereas\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    throwers = self.findByType(\"thrower\", self.findEnemies())\n    while throwers:\n        nearest = self.findNearest(throwers)\n        others = [t for t in throwers if not t is nearest]\n        self.say(others + \" - \" + throwers)\n        throwers = self.findByType(\"thrower\", self.findEnemies())\n```\n\nshows `\"[Zara] - Zara,Grel\"`.\n\nI cannot even use `type(others)` to figure out what kind of object that is. Moreover, why is my list enclosed in square brackets and the one returned by the API not?\n\nUpdate: Strangely, it works for if statements as well, when I wrap the list comprehension in a separate method like this:\n\n``` python\ndef remove(collection, element):\n    return [i for i in collection if not i is element]\n\nothers = remove(throwers, nearest)\n```\n\nBut of course, this is not the desired way to create methods for each and every list comprehension.\n Just hit this error again:\n\n```\nave = sum([y.size for y in yaks])/len(yaks)\nbig = []\nfor y in yaks:\n    if y.size > ave:\n        big.append(y)\nhero.say(hero.findNearest(big))\n```\n\nThis gives an error on the line `for y in yaks:`\n\n```\nave = 3\nbig = []\nfor y in yaks:\n    if y.size > ave:\n        big.append(y)\nhero.say(hero.findNearest(big))\n```\n\nThis works fine.  So apparently the list comprehension is breaking the `yaks` array.\n I think the remaining bug is just this one: https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/133 - Python list comprehensions give error when reusing comprehension variable name\n\nNaming your local variable something else makes your code work. I'm going to close it in favor of that one.\n    I've added a period to the end of a sentence on the README.\n  translate testing\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8473563/5776630/ba176d4e-9d8a-11e4-992e-c9995b246006.png)\ni just uploaded a code and this appeared as 2nd new entry\nps: multiplayer treasure grove\n This happens to me quite often, for me it is fixed by simply refreshing the page.\n I get bad match data pretty often. no clue who it is though (mine or somebody else)\n C++ logic\nOn Feb 11, 2015 6:46 PM, \"sotonin\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I get bad match data pretty often. no clue who it is though (mine or\n> somebody else)\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/2109#issuecomment-74008488\n> .\n  I mentioned this in hipchat, but often when I beat a repeatable level it locks up on \"Saving Progress\".  The difficulty gets bumped up, but the rewards are not granted.  Is it possible to shift the code for increasing difficulty til after the gems are granted?\n\nIs there a way to recalculate how many gems we should have earned and update how many gems earned?\n Me too! For people paying for gems, this is costing them real money...\nI also suspect the difficulty is bumped even if you lose the level, I've been unsuccessful at the desert brawl for days now, and today a flying dragon swooped in :-)\n\nI've got a screenshot of a lockup, and this was on the console afterwards, I don't see anything in it:\n\n|Thanatos's Lana| cosmicBackgroundMunchkinRadiation used power 27 of 30 spawning ogre-munchkin-m at 14.300980577245355\nAngel.coffee:47 |Thanatos's Lana| cosmicBackgroundMunchkinRadiation used power 28 of 30 spawning ogre-munchkin-m at 47.22371340962127\nAngel.coffee:47 |Thanatos's Lana| cosmicBackgroundMunchkinRadiation used power 29 of 30 spawning ogre-munchkin-f at 19.526212620548904\nAngel.coffee:47 |Thanatos's Lana| cosmicBackgroundMunchkinRadiation used power 30 of 30 spawning ogre-munchkin-f at 52.89002433186397\nAngel.coffee:47 |Thanatos's Lana| And it was so: (69.774ms per frame, 900 frames)\nSimulation   : 62797ms \nSerialization: 19ms\nDelivery     : 69ms\nworld.coffee:546 First changed frame is 1 with hash 1974568708.639473 compared to 3005833486.780201\n1222 console messages are not shown.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8174856/5787006/cd1681a4-9dbd-11e4-8f20-ba907bb8b9bf.png)\n\nIt's a fresh install of Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon, 64 bit:\n\n$ uname -a\nLinux ThinkPad 3.13.0-37-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 22 21:28:38 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n$ aptitude show google-chrome-beta\nPackage: google-chrome-beta  \nNew: yes\nState: installed\nAutomatically installed: no\nVersion: 40.0.2214.69-1\nPriority: optional\nSection: web\nMaintainer: Chrome Linux Team chromium-dev@chromium.org\nArchitecture: amd64\nUncompressed Size: 188 M\n\nBut the same thing happened on a 64bit Windows 7 with a fairly old chrome stable a few days ago too, so it probably does not matter.\n Not sure how to replicate either.  Is there a way you can look at an account and see if it has the correct number of gems for the levels beaten and items purchased?\n Like it will give the gems for the current difficulty as well as the previous difficulty that weren't awarded?\n So the only people that are out gems are those people that haven't been able to beat it again after it locked up.  That is good.\n\nNow I just need to beat Sarven Brawl 2!\n I haven't seen it for a while, not since the first couple repeatables came out. \n  I know there is a command that I can go to the console to see the current stage I'm running, but it would be awesome if somewhere on the screen it showed what stage you were on for the level.  Maybe as a part of this:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5770889/cf79a926-9d6d-11e4-8a24-c081c4ed614f.png)\nCould add a number after it:\n`Backwoods Treasure (6)`\n Looks awesome.\n\nWould also be cool if there was a way to replay lower difficulties, for example to test different strategies or heroes or to learn other languages.  Or maybe just to finally have success after constant failure!\n I would assume just keeping the gems from the highest level reached.  Basically would be cool to have the ability to swap between the different difficulties for testing tactics, not meant to earn extra gems.  Ideally submitting and failing a previous level would not set the 24 hour clock, only when submitting the highest level reached.\n\nOf course, I do think it would be cool to get a few extra gems for repeating any level in a second language, maybe earn 10% of level gems for each new level that it is done in.  I know we aren't ready for this one yet.\n @nemoyatpeace I think 10% of gems would be a good value.  It would be nice if you could get best armour + weapons without subscribing.  Pay 2 win is such a saddening business model.\n\nObviously I do realise that there is a reason pay 2 win is so popular.\n\nNote - English spelling used.\n  Is [this project](https://github.com/dpen2000/Codecombat-Vagrant) the solution for this? Or were you looking for something else?\n I'm testing it now, but I'm having some trouble. I'll mess with it and see if I can get it working.\n I've tested it, and with a few changes (pull requests pending) I was able to get it running, at least as far as seeing the title screen in the browser. (Which is a credit to dpen2000 who made the thing.)\n\nMoving that project into the main repository would be pretty easy and would actually simplify it some. As long as the Vagrantfile is at the top level, all of the various subdirectories in the codebase would be visible under /vagrant in the VM.\n\nHappy to make a pull request for this if there's interest.\n Yes, please!\n Fixed in #2582.\n  http://i.imgur.com/CdRfp4N.png\n4/5 lines long, bonus not working.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Qg1Rbw1.png\n Fixed, thanks.\n There seems to be a regression for this bug. I've played The Gauntlet right now and with this code:\n\n```\nloop:\n    self.moveRight()\n    enemy = self.findNearestEnemy()\n    while enemy.health > 0:\n        self.attack(enemy)\n```\n\nI don't get the < 6 bonus\n Oh, interesting :-) I didn't expect an _expression_ to count as separate sentences :-D, ok, ok.\n    This time I've tested it and made it as good as I could on my dev env, given all the issues there are with the style on the level player, both when resizing the window or when the window is too big or too small. :octopus: \n\nPS: Was there any other better way to make this pull request, such as editing the previous ones?\n All I can say is you certainly proved me wrong there, this is way much more complicated than I'd have hoped. Probably the whole page style doesn't help, but it is complex nonetheless.\n\nYour screen must be little less than twice the size I got here on my mbp 13'' non-retina, in which I saw no such issues. I would expect the height could be bad in some sizes, since it's dynamic based on the background height and I got no clue how that was being calculated - it just looked like it was good in my screen tests - and that's actually what probably is messing up the spell palette height.\n\nAs for the sub optimized spell palette entries, that's certainlly something to do with `flex-direction: row;` but that's also what actually makes it scrollable _vertically_ (if you try on smaller resolutions you'll see).\n\nI'll test bigger sizes now and redo. It's always a bad idea to hope any version will be final, huh? :P\n\nSo, I believe I should close this and make a new PR, right?\n  The user didn't know what submission meant in Cavern Survival. Is there information about this displayed to the user before they enter multiplayer levels? If so, can we make it more prominent? \n  I recently had a user comment that they were shown an error message on Cavern Survival to the effect of \"You should check if there is an enemy (from a call to findNearestEnemy) with an if to make sure there is someone to attack\". However, this user hadn't covered the if statement, and as a result, couldn't interpret the error message. \n\nIs there a method of preventing certain warning messages based on campaign progress?\n          So that it is easier to see whether the names are in order or not #53\n Thanks.\n  1.\u56fd\u5185\u6253\u5f00codecombat\u7f51\u7ad9\u975e\u5e38\u6162\uff0c\u767b\u5f55\u6e38\u620f\u540e\u8fdb\u5165\u5173\u5361\u8f7d\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u540e\uff0c\u5360\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5b58\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5982\u56fe\u6240\u793a\uff1a\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8425946/5701000/cddd3a28-9a80-11e4-8f2f-ccad973f0fa2.png)\n  There's no good reason to leave mongo and node out in the cold in terms of distro-provided updates. This ensures that Arch and Ubuntu get those. I'll add more distros as requested, or anyone else can. They're pretty easy. \n Also, this includes a test to ensure python3 doesn't interfere with node-gyp.\n That's great!  Will be extremely useful for anyone installing on Ubuntu/Arch\n Great work! The only thing which I am wondering about is whether to start Mongo as a service by default.   @emhs, @popey456963, what do you guys think? If you guys think it's a good move, I'll merge it in.\n @schmatz I think that starting Mongo as a service by default is good idea.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to run this script and then be able to go away and come back and it would all be setup - similar to the Windows version (except that has things that you have to click, on this one we wouldn't have to (in theory?)).\n We do have a script, `coco-mongodb`, which starts the database. My concern is that people wouldn't want Mongo running all the time as a service, though unless anyone vetoes I'll merge this in. @nwinter, what do you think? \n Alternatively, we could have two separate editions.  Clearly state what they both are, suggest one for less advanced users, the other for advanced users.\n Strangely enough, coco-mongodb didn't fail on Arch after starting Mongo via Systemd.\n Hm, weird :confused:\n Dropped Mongo autostarting from Arch. Ubuntu starts it automatically post-install. \n  I am having an issue trying to set a startTime for Waves where no matter what value you put for startTime, if it is active and present, the level will not load and cause an error page to come up. As soon as startTime is gone then the level will load.\n Yeah I fixed it. That's exactly what it was. Thanks for the message back\ntho, appreciate it.\n\nCan you check the JS console to see if it's spitting out any error messages\nabout not being able to spawn the wave, maybe due to a misconfigured wave\nor not matching the Builds/Spawns dependent ThangTypes?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/2086#issuecomment-69522695\n.\n  previous attempt had width and height pixels swapped. no idea if this is in the right place, but this sure worked under chrome inspector: `<div class=\"properties\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 230px; overflow: auto;\">`\n Fair enough. I've been trying to apply and test it on my dev env here, but there's a lot to digest. I should get back soon, but... I accept hints on which files I should look for it. :P\n I found `SpellPaletteView.coffee` quite essential as well. I could make a new PR, but it would still not be \"flexible size\". As far as I can see the play level view isn't responsive and its height is quite fixed. Can't I leave at least the height fixed as well?\n\nThis should work, I just couldn't test properly because I still couldn't find how to get the God Like user or tweak the DB to give me lots of items and thus increase the help book.\n Yeah, I saw that `updateMaxHeight`, but it has no practical effect. Or at least none I could see. As far as I can tell it's just setting the a virtual height to keep each of the `property-entry-column` within that virtual frame, which can't be seen because it's offscreen and off its parent divs.\n\nI actually prefer having a vertical scrolling, but for whatever reason the horizontal one worked first and easier, so I figured it works... I'll try to see if I can make it vertical then there's no need to fix height.\n  no idea if this is in the right place, but this sure worked under chrome inspector: <div class=\"properties\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 230px; overflow: auto;\">\n  This would be awesome!\n  under codecombat/editor\nwe have just 3 editor THANG, Level, Article editor..\nWhat is that campaign??? \n Maybe the campaign isn't an editor?  I think I might have misunderstood you, are you looking for the campaign editor?  IIRC that's the same as the level editor.\n @popey, If you login from a form apart from the main page example  http://codecombat.com/editor/campaign/forest .Login on this page,have a closer look on the URL,your Id and password will be concatenated.\n @GeetikaBatra Ah, I understand that part!  I don't understand @jieunko 's question.\n Oh I meant that there's no description about http://codecombat.com/editor/campaign\nin http://codecombat.com/editor page \nso I was wondering what that campaign page's about?\n Okay so i figured out the cause, the problem seems to be resolved if a certain delay is added in accessing the file auth.jade(/app/templates/core/), this file is loaded instantly, even before the post method is called, hence leading to fetch url in next window along with params.\nSo a simple solution is to add delay at start in fetching file, correct me if i am in wrong direction @nwinter [For a sample test to this add a manual delay to auth.jade]\nAdding a  debugger in start pf Modal open() in Cocoview.coffee, solves the problem\n Hi this is my first bug here! I have built the dev environment. Can i fix this ?\n @amankr I added the overiding method for signup clicks. Its working great now :+1: \n    In the level endangered burl,the attack command wont work.Here is a screenshot for that.\n![cc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8664238/5692684/1f6b6f34-9925-11e4-8b9c-8f0d2dee631d.png)\n  Having the same issue in Keeping Time (desert level) with the following code:\n\n```\ne = self.findNearest(self.findEnemies())\nwhile e.health > 0:\n    self.attack(e)\n```\n\nIn fact, this seems to be happening in just about ANY level where I use `while` in Python. This is seriously degrading the experience coding in Python (which I joined CodeCombat to learn). In fact, I spent over an hour trying to figure out if I was missing some kind of loop terminator.\n\nOriginal forum report: http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/python-while-loop-runs-infinitely/2407\n\n![000f82d8e3_690x375](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1724064/5839964/2a86e306-a160-11e4-9ccf-32b4f60d7282.png)\n Interestingly, the following code (including a `while` loop) appeared to work fine in [Preferential Treatment](http://codecombat.com/play/level/preferential-treatment)\n\n```\nself.say(\"Imma count to 3, then BAM!\")\nwhile self.now() < 2:\n    self.say(self.now())\n\ne = self.findNearest(self.findEnemies())\nself.cleave(e)\n# First, loop through all enemies...\nenemies = self.findEnemies()\nthrowers = []\nfor e in enemies:\n    if e.type == \"thrower\":\n        throwers.append(e)\n# ... but only attack 'thrower' type enemies.\n# And don't forget to use your special abilities!\nfor t in throwers:\n    while t.health > 0: #   <=== Here's the working 'while' loop\n        self.attack(t)\n# Then loop through all the enemies again...\nenemies = self.findEnemies()\nenemyIndex = 0\n# ... and take out everyone who's still standing.\nfor e in enemies:\n    if self.isReady(\"cleave\"): self.cleave(e)\n    self.attack(e)\n```\n I think you are on the right track with the enemy variable not being updated.\nI have identical results with \n\nwhile enemy.health > 0:  \n\nas with using\n\nloop:\n  if (enemy.health <= 0 ):\n    break\n\ni.e. enemy.health == enemy.maxHealth and does not change\n  Is there a piece of software (that is not in the web-browser), that I can run in order to simulate the matches?\nSimilar to [this](http://codecombat.com/play/ladder/cavern-survival#simulate).\n    There were many errors, attending grammar and ortography. Now everything is more or less correct.\n Just done. Sorry, I didn't realize about that (even though it's clearly said both in the original and in the translated text :D) \n   My pleasure :)\n\n----- Reply message -----\n\u041e\u0442: \"Imperadeiro98\" notifications@github.com\n\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0443: \"codecombat/codecombat\" codecombat@noreply.github.com\n\u041a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u044f: \"nixel2007\" nixel2007@gmail.com\n\u0422\u0435\u043c\u0430: [codecombat] Update ru.coffee (#2074)\n\u0414\u0430\u0442\u0430: \u043f\u0442, \u044f\u043d\u0432. 9, 2015 17:58\n\nThank you for keeping ru up-to-date :) @nixel2007\n\n&mdash;\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n  @differentmatt here's the full code.\n\n``` python\n# Stay alive for two minutes.\n# If you win, it gets harder (and more rewarding).\n# If you lose, you must wait a day before you can resubmit.\n# Remember, each submission gets a new random seed.\nloop:\n    enemies = self.findEnemies()\n    enemy = self.findNearest(enemies)\n    if is_soldier(enemy):\n        if self.distanceTo(enemy) > 10:\n            self.moveXY(46, 78)  # Move to safety\n        if not heavy_attack(enemy):\n            self.attack(enemy)\n    else:\n        self.moveXY(46, 78)  # Move to safety\n\ndef heavy_attack(enemy):\n    if self.isReady(\"cleave\") and self.distanceTo(enemy) <= 10:\n        self.cleave(enemy)\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_soldier(enemy):\n    if enemy and not is_sandyak(enemy):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef is_munchkin(enemy):\n    return enemy.type == \"munchkin\"\n\ndef is_scout(enemy):\n    return enemy.type == \"scout\"\n\ndef is_ogre(enemy):\n    return enemy.type == \"ogre\"\n\ndef is_sandyak(enemy):\n    return enemy.type == \"sand-yak\"\n```\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/497458/5684388/d58944ac-9827-11e4-8ca2-899eb71e5aa9.png)\n Good catch, but I think that's a different issue. Unlike in Python, defining your functions before using them does work in filbert (I've been doing it in a couple of levels so far). So this error might be caused by something else?\n\nFor example, if I define `talk()` at the end and call it as the first statement, then the code runs fine and the first thing my character does is say \"yo\" before getting stuck at `is_soldier(enemy)`.\n\n``` python\ntalk()\n\nloop:\n    ...\n\n...\n\ndef talk():\n    self.say(\"yo\")\n```\n      Your guys realy do a great job!\n Hi,@Imperadeiro98  ,I have signed the CLA, and my id is teikasen\n  I was able to fix this but am not sure if this is how you want it.

I'll add my descriptions for them, let me know if they are right.\n- [x] disintegrate\n- [x] dispel\n- [x] fireball\n- [x] flame-armor\n- [x] goldstorm\n- [x] invisibility\n- [x] lightning-bolt\n- [x] summon-burl\n- [x] summon-undead\n- [x] swap\n- [x] teleport\n- [x] antigravity\n- [x] chain-lightning\n- [x] time-warp\n- [x] summon-fangrider\n- [x] ice-rink\n **1. disintegrate** \n- Beam attack, high damage, long cooldown.\n- Properties setup, needs to be coded.  Damage and cooldown may need adjustment\n\n**2. dispel** - COMPLETE\n- Remove all effects on the target.  \n\n**3. fireball**\n- Fireball attack, splash damage\n- Properties setup, needs to be coded.  Damage, radius, and cooldown may need adjustment\n\n**4. flame Armor**\n- Clothe target in flame for a time, all melee attackers take damage, adds HP to target health and maxHealth.\n- Properties setup, needs to be coded.  Damage, health, and cooldown may need adjustment\n\n**5. goldstorm**\n- A bunch of coins spawn around the target\n- Should spawned coins expire after a given amount of time?\n- Properties setup, needs to be coded.  Radius, amount, and cooldown may need adjustment\n\n**6. invisibility** - Needs graphics\n- Target can't be seen by enemies (or should target be invisible to friends as well?)\n- Properties set, coding complete, just needs something to mark that the unit is invisible\n\n**7. lightning bolt**\n- Lightning Attack, possibly bounces to other targets?\n- Added this description: \n\n```\nCasts a `\"lightning-bolt\"` spell on `target` if within #{spells['lightning-bolt'].range}m, causes #{spells['lightning-bolt'].damage} damage to `target` and bounces to #{spells['lightning-bolt'].bounces} additional targets if within #{spells['lightning-bolt'].bounceRange}m of previouse `target`.  Each bounce damage is adjusted by a factor of #{spells['lightning-bolt'].bounceFactor}.\n```\n- Properties set, this needs some major coding work in order to make it fit the given definition.\n\n**8. summon Burl**\n- Spawns a burl\n- Properties setup\n\n**9. summon Undead**\n- Spawns an undead (skeleton?)\n- Properties setup - Set to be able to spawn multiple undead if desired.\n\n**10. swap** - COMPLETE\n- trades places with target - COMPLETE\n\n**11. teleport** - Started\n- Moves caster to a position within a given distance - Can I teleport someone else?\n- Currently only works to teleport to another thang, cannot teleport to a position.\n\n**12. antigravity**\n- Causes units in area to fly?  Not sure what this one is for.\n- Modified properties to at least resemble what will be needed, also adjusted description somewhat, leaving some parts to be updated when the intent of the spell is understood.\n **invisibility**: Would it be cool to have something that looked like the ghost from SCII for each champion?  It might take a bit of art work, but it would make it look really cool.  [Image](http://us.battle.net/sc2/static/images/game/unit/screenshot/thumb/ghost-zerg-thumb.jpg) and [Image](https://feb33d8763de0c0f2e0a-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/MEDcVHzblQgW.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg).\n**lightning-bolt**: If it were infinite range, it would make some interesting strategies and it would be easier to code, however would it be too good?\n**swap**: Does this have a range?  Otherwise it could be amazingly over-powered.\n**teleport**: What would happen if you teleported to a position that made the game far easier, or impossible to complete?  I think the range should be quite short.\n**antigravity**: If this works well, it would be cool!  Not sure if it would need new animations for each character (people walking in the air would look somewhat weird)\n My 2 cents.\n\n**Teleport:** I think this should not have any params, it should teleport just the caster a set distance in a _random_ direction. This would be an \"escape\" type spell. Give you a little room to get away and do something.\n The only problem with swap being an escape is that it doesn't help a bit in a duel situation. Because you'd be swapping with the enemy you are dueling and the whole point is to get away from them, if they are in your face swapping with them will do you no good. :)\n Hm, I'm going to sit on the fence here.\nOn the one hand it would be cool to have an escape mechanism that dosen't kill someone on your team.\nOn the other hand it would be good that you had to sacrifice a unit to do it.\n So, I guess my Lightning Bolt description is really more of a Chain Lightning description.\n\nI agree, **if** teleport is to a position, we have to be very careful that it doesn't teleport to spots that break levels (think teleport outside of Sarven-Brawl Arena).  Maybe it has to be line of sight?\n\nSwap should always be callable, I wouldn't want it to only be cast on friendly units, unless it is connected to a pet, so you only have it if you also have a pet to swap with.  But I like the idea of being able to swap with any unit inside a given radius. Could be really fun if it also meant that enemy missiles would now hit the swapped unit.  i.e. you just shot an arrow at me, I swap places with you and your arrow hits yourself!  Not sure if this can be done.\n Looking at the spells yet to be coded, and knowing that casters are already pretty strong for survival, would be nice to see more aoe spells with higher damage on the higher end items.  I guess poison-cloud does that and timewarp would be an aoe debuff.\n You have a point, what about if we had a group cooldown?  On League of Legends, a character called Udyr has it so that each spell he casts puts all of his other spells on a short cooldown.\n      When Omarn is standing in the corner waiting for enemies to come to him and has a thrower approaching, he throws a plasma ball at the thrower, but when the thrower stops short, the plasma ball hits the spot the thrower would have been rather than continuing til it hits the thrower.  Is this intended?  I think that my bolt should go all the way to the thrower, though if the thrower actually changes direction, I'm ok with him being able to dodge.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5631940/a3bc9a7e-9605-11e4-9d50-2af5073ecb2d.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5631946/b11a29fc-9605-11e4-827c-e0a460da17e3.png)\n Biggest thing to me is that the dude is walking straight for me.  If he was walking a zig-zag, I could see maybe missing.  Shouldn't my wizard be smart enough to recognize that the thrower is going to stop and attack that spot?  My strong wizard should be able to one hit 7 hp throwers without taking damage, but I always require 2 shots.\n\nIs there a way that I can just attack a point? Then I could calculate that I'm attacking a thrower and shoot at the spot he will stop.\n\nI think it would be better if the plasma ball followed a straight path to the fullness of its range and hit whatever enemy was first in the way.\n  Sync to en.\n   New string translations for es-ES\n  Just asking, is it really need to separate prefix and shortcut?

It might be even better to the left of the sign up button, but making an example of that is hard without the code.\nAnother solution may be to place it in the menu that appears when the three lines are pressed.\n @nwinter how do I make changes to discourse and blog ? Also the last two points seems to have resolved by using campaign selection slugs when we click on the play button.\n  Wanting to start the desert level 'Medical Attention' the helping arrow, indicating what to equip, doesn't work properly. Can't start the level.\n![bug1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2663480/5602477/5fc0acdc-9350-11e4-86ad-98e6803b362a.PNG)\nScrolling down does not affect the arrow.\n![bug2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2663480/5602476/5fc03c48-9350-11e4-8886-1500a4f6bff3.PNG)\n\nOccured with Chrome 39.0.2171.95, Win7, playing/learning JavaScript, Captain Anya Weston.\n I had this issue as well.  If you scroll through the items, you will find one that is highlighted green.  You need to purchase that sensing stone, or a better one.  (I'd get a better one as within two levels you will be required to purchase the next step up anyway.)  If you can afford it, just buy the top one so you don't have to worry about it.\n\nThat said, I agree that this is a bug in the display, need to better highlight what is needed.  Maybe to put the required items that have not been purchased yet in a list just after the restricted list.  Would also be good to be clear that the required item can also be improved upon instead of just getting the simple one.\n Had the problem some levels before too. There one item was marked green. Here only the Rough Sense Stone is marked but restricted. So yeah, some better Sense Stone should be the option, but this is not indicated here. ;)\n\nBy the way, accessing 'this.pos' is possible even without the Rough Sense Stone. \n Yes, I think technically you can access any of the attributes, you just don't get documentation on it until you have the item.\n I bought a better Sense Stone, so I can't test it anymore. However, it is now indicated that the stone has to be equiped. Even though the arrow does not follow the scrolling. ;)\n\nThanks for the fast help! :)\n  When I type `if canc` I canCast is highlighted so I hit enter to activate the auto complete and it is replaced with `self.canCast('drain-life',target)`\n\nWould be nice if it was replaced with `if self.canCast('drain-life',target)`.\n By the way, if I do `if self.c` and hit the auto correct it replaces perfectly.\n Neh, noticed it either at coffeescript and the 'else' keyword. I thought parser search the (), and if it can't find it, it replaces whole string. But it doesn't correlate with 'if self.c' situation. \n Rather than replacing whole line, would make more sense for it to replace backwards to a space.\n Or (, \"&\", \"||\" and other special symbols. \n   Nah, they were on the other spanish coffee and I just made like 10 changes :)\n    I'll do my best :)\n For dungeon levels: The levels are small, so we need stuff for the walls. Spiders and webs were my first thought. They could be useful on the corners. Also skulls for levels with enemies could make the levels different. Other than that, there isn't a lot to do on this levels. They are cool as they are right now. \n Had a great time adding doodads to the oasis level.\n  I tried several ways to cast this spell, but am not able to cast the \"raise-dead\" spell from the Unholy Tome item.\n\n<hr/>\n\n``` javascript\n// Cast spell like in the function documentation\nif (this.canCast(\"raise-dead\")) {\n    this.cast(\"raise-dead\");\n}\n\n// Fix Your Code\n// You need something to cast upon\n```\n\n<hr/>\n\n``` javascript\n// Select an enemy or corpse in range (< 20m) as target\nif (this.canCast(\"raise-dead\")) {\n    this.cast(\"raise-dead\", target);\n}\n\n// Fix Your Code\n// Unhandled error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'maxHealth' of undefined;\n```\n\n<hr/>\n Unfortunately the problem still occurs in all of my browsers.\n\nFix Your Code\nLine 12: You need something to cast upon.\n\n``` javascript\n// The Forest - Ogre Encampment.\n// Miss Hushbaum + Unholy Tome III\nvar enemy;\n\nloop {\n    enemy = this.findNearestEnemy();\n\n    if (enemy) {\n        this.cast(\"drain-life\", enemy);\n    } else {\n        if (this.canCast(\"raise-dead\")) {\n            this.cast(\"raise-dead\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n- Chrome 39.0.2171.95\n- Safari 8.0.2 \n Yes, I had this issue, but then I think I just cast on myself and it would cast.  The problem was that they corpse would stand up, then drop again.\n\nI'm wondering if maybe the raise dead shouldn't have a duration, since it only raises one corpse anyway, I think it should be raised at half health until killed again.  This might also fix the issue of him just dying again.\n OK, so now RaiseDead has real problems, this might be because I'm attempting to cast when there are no enemies around.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5594058/a1cebe00-9271-11e4-9e6e-d20c09b69e3b.png)\n\n```\nif self.canCast(\"raise-dead\", self):\n        self.cast(\"raise-dead\",self)\n        self.say(\"Arise!\")\n```\n\nNowhere in my code do I look at maxHealth, so the error must be raised by raise dead.\n OK, I submitted a patch to fix that last error.  Corpses do seem to attack ogres now, but they are attacked by humans and thus they die before they are able to do anything.  (I'm testing on siege of stonehold).  I guess something needs to be adjusted in the targeting AI so that it actually looks at the current team rather than just the original team.\n Looking at this:\n\n```\n  getEnemies: ->\n    # Optimize\n    return [] unless @canSee\n    enemies = []\n    for thang in @allianceSystem.allAlliedThangs\n      if thang.superteam isnt @superteam and thang[@significantProperty] and @canSee thang\n        enemies.push thang\n    enemies\n```\n\nLooks like I need to change the superteam of the corpses, is that possible?\n\nYep, it is!  I changed the superteam and now the raised corpses attack my enemies and are attacked by my friends.\n\nI still think that maybe we should remove the duration, though I think they were all killed before the time would have run out.\n Hmmm, so I just tried it out on Odd Sandstorm, killed two munchkins, then cast raise-dead. The raised munchkin got killed by a yak causing the quest to fail because a human died.  \n\nI wonder if things will work properly if the superteam is changed, but the team left alone.  Nope, if I leave team alone, the raised ogres just die again instantly, I tested again on Seige of Stormhold.  \n\nNot sure if it is really an issue that the ogre counts as a human that can't be killed.  But could the mission be a specific count of humans that survive instead of all humans so that the ogre raised to human could die without failing the quest.\n Hmmm, this caused issues in Rich Forager as well.  I raised two different ogres, after the proper period of time they both died again, then the quest ended with this failure: \"Your hero must survive. (1/2)\"\n\nWhile they were dead, they did flip back and forth some like earlier corpses did though.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5596859/da995ec8-92d2-11e4-8f1c-04ad6b6ef03b.png)\n Going to the original issue here, this seems to be where the error is happening, not sure what is wrong with it though.\n\nFrom `magic.Casts`:\n\n```\n cast: (spell, target, methodName) ->\n    target ?= @ if spell.name in ['time-warp', 'raise-dead', 'windstorm']  # TODO: figure out how to not have to hard-code the self target list check in here.\n    unless target\n      throw new ArgumentError \"You need something to cast upon.\", methodName or 'cast', \"target\", \"object\", target\n\n```\n Is there a removeEffect method?  Can I create a raisedDie function like this:\n\n```\n  raisedDie: ->\n    #What happens when the unit dies again.\n    @.removeEffect 'confuse'\n    @.die() \n```\n\nConnected to this, does the name of the effect matter?  This is from the raise-dead function:\n\n```\nif corpse \n        effects = [\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, setTo: false, targetProperty: 'dead'}\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, setTo: @raisedChooseAction, targetProperty: 'chooseAction'}\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, setTo: corpse.maxHealth / 2, targetProperty: 'health'}\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, factor: 0.5, targetProperty: 'maxSpeed'}\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, setTo: 'humans', targetProperty: 'team'}\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, setTo: 'humans', targetProperty: 'superteam'}\n          {name: 'confuse', duration: @raiseDeadDuration, reverts: true, setTo: 'corpse', targetProperty: 'type'}\n        ]\n        corpse.addEffect effect, @ for effect in effects\n\n```\n\nShould the `name: 'confuse'` be changed to something like `name: 'raised'`?\n So, I added the line about effects:\n\n```\n\n  raisedDie: ->\n    #What happens when the unit dies again.\n    @effects = (e for e in @effects when e.name isnt 'confuse')\n    @die()\n\n```\n\n and now I get this error basically right after I raise the dude:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5601758/27cfec64-9352-11e4-873d-c340cd27cade.png)\n Should I be able to raise an opponent hero?  I'm trying in Treasure Grove, but it doesn't work, I cast, but he doesn't get raised.\n I'm not sure where to go to finish fixing, and will have to focus my time on lesson plans now, hopefully someone can finalize for us.\n Well, it seems touchy, sometimes it casts and other times it doesn't.  I felt like I had it working on one level, but not another.  Hard to test on different levels though as I always have to open it in the editor to equip the item.\n So, I just found a bug with this.  If a corpse is targeted by an enemy, that enemy seems to continue to target the corpse even after it has died again.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5757272/c97c20fe-9cf4-11e4-86db-6092fdab3bcf.png)\n\nKinda fun watching Ogres pound on dead ogres, but probably not in the plan!\n write down  your code\n That is not a helpful comment, this thread is discussing issues with raise dead.  My code doesn't play into it.  Why is it that your only comments on here are two inappropriate instructions to write down full code? \n In this case, he was killed, not sure about if it times out.  Don't know how to test, they would need to time out while being attacked.  The corpse is not attacked by new enemies, only by the enemies that were already attacking when it died.\n I added findCorpses, it seems to work.\n\nOn another note, if you raise a thrower they die insanely fast, basically a waste.  Would be cool if raise dead always raised the most powerful or if it would raise a certain power, so if throwers, it will raise 2 or 3 of them so they at least survive enough to throw a spear before they just drop again.\n misc.PowerTable?\n Sure, but will have to wait til Spring Break most likely.\n    Is there a way to start the levels fully zoomed out?  It takes a moment to realize where the ogre or the retreat point is for levels \"Dust\" and \"Desert Combat\".\n  // While your health is full, yell insults at the smaller ogres to draw their ire.\n\nI think you meant \"fire\".\n Looked up the word \"ire\".  I stand corrected.  Thanks for teaching me a new word.\n  So, I just started playing with Haste and love that I can always be hasted!  In talking with @nwinter I realize that the issue is the fact that haste is affecting the passage of time toward the cooldown allowing me to haste in 5 seconds instead of 10 seconds.  If we just changed all the specific cooldowns to 15 seconds that would amount to 10 real seconds as the first 5 seconds would be hasted and count as 10 seconds, leaving another 5 seconds of cooldown after the haste has expired.\n\nOf course, this only works if the haste is cast on self.  If haste is cast on someone else then this wouldn't be good.\n\nI was going to change the specific cooldown in the thang, but I guess maybe it needs to be done on the code side, will see if I can figure out a way to do it there.\n\nOK, so in action.Acts I see this line:\n\n```\n    @actionHeats[@action] = action.specificCooldown if action.specificCooldown\n```\n\nI was thinking of adding something like this:\n\n```\n    @actionHeats[@action] = action.specificCooldown*1.5 if @getActionName() == 'haste' and @target == @\n```\n\nI'm not sure if I have the syntax correct or if it will work anyway.  The thinking is checking if the action is 'haste' and the target is self.  Would this work?\n So I was thinking about this a little more.  As it stands, even if haste were to have a 10 second cooldown, with the way that cooldowns are affected by haste as well, you could conceivably keep the enemy slowed for 75% of the time while you are hasted for 50% of the time:\n\nt=0 haste on, slow on\nt=5 haste off, slow recast\nt=10 haste on, slow off\nt=12.5 slow recast\nt=15 haste off\nt=17.5 slow off\nt=20 repeat cycle\n\nSo the enemy is slowed for 15 out of 20 seconds.  Maybe the speed up shouldn't affect spell cooldowns at all?  Or maybe haste and slow should have the same cooldown or be on different items so you can't have both of them or...\n  Upp to line 667\n   No problem :)\n  There's no scrollbar in options inside game menu (in a level). This is a problem when a user wants to edit configuration.\n     Done, I'm sorry for this \n  - Added new translations\n- Made modifications to existing translations after consulting a friend well versed in macedonian linguistics\n    Example:\n{\n    \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"549e78f802c17db20630fc4d\"),\n    \"properties\" : {\n        \"category\" : \"Play Level\"\n    },\n    \"event\" : \"Started Level\",\n    \"user\" : ObjectId(\"532e9352192f4e8954acb24e\"),\n    \"created\" : ISODate(\"2014-12-27T09:16:40.143Z\"),\n    \"__v\" : 0\n}\n  It thinks for a second and reloads the page as if it's doing something, but it doesn't add any i18n attributes or add an i18n coverage property.\n  @Imperadeiro98 please clarify about what you mean by autorun code.\n I know what he means; I'll take care of it when I'm in a cleanup mood.\n  Up to 591 + some ones that were missing\n   I don't know how many people know about the game, but I'm sure going to spread the word. In my opinion everyone should know at least some basic programming and this game is an excellent way to introduce it to players of every age and occupation.\n  The terrain generator has some logic to place various doodads in it automatically based on the terrain type and map size: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/modals/GenerateTerrainModal.coffee#L222-L249\n\nI put a super basic stub for the desert in there, but it would be awesome to actually use all the new desert  doodads in there (and none of the forest shrub/rock things).\n\nOnce the local dev environment is set up, you would create a new empty level, generate a desert terrain, and see how barren it is. You'd then edit GenerateTerrainModal.coffee to add some more of the doodads, regenerate the terrain to see how it went, and go from there until all the new desert doodads get placed sometimes and in places that make sense.\n\n![screenshot 2014-12-28 21 27 45](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5566312/69d4cef0-8ed8-11e4-8f24-67747a1d4734.png)\n A little elaboration is required here. What exactly are you looking for? Do you need to fill the space with at least one of every desert related doodad or just the flooring and the boundaries?\n  I'm not sure why it was so high up, but I'll pull it down when the screen is wide enough for three columns, since otherwise we need all the height we can get.\n    More translations after propagination\n  User reported a bug on IE11 with many details:\n1.

Looking at it, the the human at the heal point looks almost knocked down..so she probably died and got healed after the fact...so I think this may be a bug.\n\n![codecombatbugmedical](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4033083/5544977/a271e38a-8ada-11e4-8287-417ea2a57c09.PNG)\n  I just loaded village guard with no prior code and the sample code beat the level because findNearestEnemy will still detect enemies on the right side and some seeds don't manage to kill a peasant if you don't cover both sides.\n\nThis is also affected by the boots I was wearing: the Leather Boots grant +2 m/s speed, which allows my hero to move quickly enough to defend against the munchkin rush.

Bootstrap is [appending the popover](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers) to the body element, so it doesn't know that it shouldn't go off the bottom of the screen.\n so for that we can make moveable popup ?so user can put it anywhere.  what you think ?\n The user isn't going to want to move the popover, plus it triggers on hover, so you wouldn't be able to move it easily because moving the mouse over it would probably lose the hover. Instead we need to better calculate where to put it so that it doesn't go off the bottom of the screen. If I knew exactly how to do it, I would have done it already, but my plan would be to just start fiddling with popover container options and CSS positioning.\n\nSwing by the HipChat room, it'll be easier to ask questions: http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa\n ![screenshot from 2015-01-08 22 45 28](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10094679/5666780/25d9e72c-9788-11e4-8be6-74413e86e335.png)\ni made changes and put it just beside the compiler . so that it will not go off the screen . whats your suggestion ?\n but sometimes it looks like this. \n![screenshot from 2015-01-09 00 40 49](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10094679/5668774/29df28ea-9798-11e4-9548-43618175f1de.png)\nso what do you think about this. i think so let fix position by adding some conditions so that it will always pop over at perticular position . \n let fix position just beside the compiler . as shown in earliar screen shot. \n Hi,\nI got the same, how to fix it ?\nSee at the bottom of the page, I can't see the items beyond the self.say.\n![2015-01-11-121509_1280x800_scrot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10477497/5695039/a2e48330-998b-11e4-880d-36ff6f3c2130.png)\n @nosheep IIRC changing your zoom level (ctrl + -/=) you can get your commands back.\n @popey456963 Oh, thanks, it work perfectly!\n @nwinter  what is your idea to fix specific  position  for all popover ? \n Another instance, likely due to blue script dialog.

Sometimes the popovers block the view to the code. If one can see the code while studying the spell info it would be easier to relate to.\n The only case where it displays off screen still is when you were hovering over it during a blue script, and then the script goes away, and you don't move your mouse. (Once you move it again, it goes to the right position.) Probably not important enough to worry about.\n      Hi, I've already sign the CLA, and this is my PR. :)\n   No problem, hopefully will translate it all :)\n I would like to be mentioned on contributor - diplomat page :)\n Cool, thanks :)\n  It would be nice to have a method that helps to create pathfinding algorithms by telling the user if a specific tile (x, y) is walkable. \n\nIf could be done a few ways, doesn't matter too much the 2 possible options I can envision are as follows:\n1. this.hasObstacle(x, y)\n   If there is a house, fence, tree, etc at that coord (player can not physically step on the tile) then it would return true otherwise false.\n2. this.isWalkable(x, y)\n   This could possibly integrate into the built in pathfinding system, where x, y is where you wish to end up and it calculates through the same as moveXY but detects if you will end up against an obstacle with \"i can not reach there\" message. It shouldn't actually move you, just return a true or false. Option 1 is much easier imo and should be just fine.\n My remark:\n\n`isPathClear(pos1, pos2)`: Does this mean there is a straight path, or that pathing is possible without encountering any hazards? I would reduce it to just obstacles, limit it to straight lines and let the players manage the hazards himself. \n\n`findHazards`: Returns a list with all currently visible hazards, as with the enemies. If the player wants to remember a currently not visible trap he has seen in the past, he has to save it somehow. In a complex multiplayer-levels with walls that block line-of-sight and movement, information can get old (except with the best glasses) (I'm imagianing possibilities here).\n\nQuerrying every Thang is really not the best thing as described. But for the Thangs one can get, can you somehow get the dimensions of it? It is one thing to know there is a pit at (12,34), but another one to know that it reaches from (10,32) to (14,36).\n It is straight lines from my tests. it doesn't try to calculate a path. If there is something in between you and the second pos (ie tree stand) even if you could walk around it one tile and get there it will say the path is not clear.\n\nWe dont want to make it only obstacles. hazards are very important. we want to count traps on the ground as obstacles.\n Implemented this a while ago.\n  Few changes\n  Hello! I'm newbie in translating, and I'd love to learn new things. Here's my first try. I've changed some parts. \n  Just understood that this is the better place to post bugs....should the other question in discourse.codecombat.com be deleted?\n\nIs there a ledger logging what you spent your crystals on? Asking because I got a shield (Painted Steel Shield) in Sarven Road that gave me enough HP...but I don't recall purchasing it as when I goto other levels it does not show that shield being available.\n\nSo the questions are:\n\nDid I actually purchase the shield?\nIf I did, where is it and why is it still locked?\nIf I didn't, what bug is this where I got to inadvertently \"borrow\" equipment?\n Not sure!

(I am using safari on os x)\n\nHis `photoURL` is `\"\"`, so it's showing the gravatar. I can try to upload the same avatar and see what's up when he lets me know what image he's using.\n      I'm working on the CodeCombat level \"The Dunes\" in Python. I'm noticing that when I have my code structured in a certain way, there's runtime lag. \n\nIf I have it set up this way, it's fine.\n\n```\nloop:\n    enemy = self.findNearestEnemy()\n    item = self.findNearestItem()\n    if item:\n        # Collect coins.\n          if item:\n            pos = item.pos\n            itemX = pos.x\n            itemY = pos.y\n            self.moveXY(itemX, itemY)    \n    if enemy:\n        if enemy.type is 'sand-yak' or enemy.type is 'burl':\n            # Don't fight Sand Yaks or Burls! Just keep collecting coins.\n            pass\n        # But if the enemy is a 'thrower' or an 'ogre', fight them.\n        if enemy.type is 'thrower' or enemy.type is 'ogre' and self.distanceTo(enemy) < 20:\n\n```\n\nIf I move my 'if item' near to the end of my code, with an else, then the loop appears to prioritise the 'enemy' portion of the code, and slows down on going to the 'item' part of the code. There is a significant delay, as it seems to constantly be working in the 'enemy' portion, and rarely going to the 'item' portion.\n\nHowever, if I structure the code as I have it set up, above, it runs smoothly, and will prioritise the coins first, and rarely jump to the enemy (only if no coins are left). Which is fine.\n\nJust curious as to why this might be the case :)\n\nThanks!\n  Adding some translations again, hopefully will do them all.\n  problem_alert_help\n  Added some translations\n  I spawned in one of the buildings when submitting my code, which caused my character to jiggle around a bit but not approach the target. It was clear by the waypoints that it tried to, but it simply found no way that was passable (because it was in an impassable object).\n  Only minor corrections\n  Some translations\n    So I was attempting to have Omarn run to the nearest friend.  Unfortunately at the beginning of the level, apparently the peasants are the nearest friend, so I run to the peasant to start with, then continue to push that peasant off the edge of the map.  I do survive, but note my final location of x=-301.  I don't think it is a big deal that there is nothing blocking the side of the map.  My concern is why the nearest friend is a peasant when I have to run past the archers in order to get to the peasant.  Wondering if maybe the peasants spawn earlier than the archers and before the first frame is calculated.\n\nI fixed the problem by simply telling my looking at all archers and soldiers instead of all friends.\n\nHeading past archers to get to \"nearest\" friend, the peasant.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5427654/39000778-83e2-11e4-82ae-60c66a2c996d.png)\n\nEnd of the quest, hiding well off the screen since I've been pushing the peasant for a couple minutes.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5427597/921603c8-83e0-11e4-9b9a-848833aa7add.png)\n  I just purchased Omarn and am using him on Seige of Stonehold.  I had previously beaten the level using Amara.  In the code I was using the throw command.  Upon switching to Omarn I still have the throw command.  As in this screenshot, I am in the process of throwing a charge at an ogre, you can see the charge in the air and the list of throw as a function.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5427501/542535ee-83da-11e4-8c27-3bb615fa22e2.png)\n\nHere is what I have equipped:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/5427509/c646572a-83da-11e4-891d-ac900a38635d.png)\n He seems to be able to throw them in other levels as well.  Says he gets throw as a potion master.  I don't see anything about what potion he is throwing though.  Maybe this isn't a bug?\n I need to work on Omarn's throw; he is supposed to be throwing an explosive potion, but we haven't hooked up cool explosive potion art yet, and it would probably be more fun for him to be able to utilize different potions (maybe drinking them). And currently his potions don't scale up as you progress in the game, so they should be changed to something that does.\n  I have a Macbook pro running 10.6.8 with 4GB and Intel Core i7\nWhen viewing codecombat with an updated version of Chrome (ver 39.0.2121.95) the graphics are a mess in the warrior window as shown below.\nThe following demo works just fine although a bit slow. http://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-13 at 9 03 23 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2540198/5426422/46385740-830d-11e4-8e02-06623713dcd4.png)\n Here is another level \n![screen shot 2014-12-13 at 9 28 01 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2540198/5426449/17d3254a-830f-11e4-9000-08835be29c9f.png)\n This is a rare bug that we've seen a few reports of before, but as of yet we have no way to debug it or figure out what might be going wrong. Any help figuring out where it does/doesn't happen (particular levels, particular browsers, particular browser versions, with/without extensions, etc.) would be great in narrowing it down.\n I am not seeing any graphic issues running the same system as mentioned before but running the latest version of Firefox (34.0.5)\n We are having the same problem - Chrome on a macbook pro early 2008 with OSX10.6.8.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/293459/5691567/c0203278-98cd-11e4-8a57-5ed73b542c4f.png)\n\nOn Safari on that same system, it didn't load at all.  (halfway through the loading bar it hung).\n\nWill try FF.   \n\nTo me, it looks like a graphics memory access issue - the repeated tiles are other graphics memory that has been assigned wrong.  Not sure why this would happen but it's a pretty low-level bug.\n\nThe gameplay works fine - it's just the display makes it impossible to play.\n Could be... I tried with FF - had to download the latest version.... and it worked.  So that's cool for now.  I spent today upgrading the Macbook pro so it is ready for a later OS (it needed more ram and a bigger disk) and my next step is to upgrade to Mavericks.  I'll let you know if that solves it, in any event.\n\nBy the way, my 9 yo son LOVES the game - he went through the whole dungeon in a couple of hours this afternoon, and is thrilled to have IF statements at his disposal now.  Congrats on this.\n Yep!  Updated to Mavericks and it works with Chrome now.  So it seems like a 10.6.8 + Chrome issue in addressing the graphics card.\n  From [the forum](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/tie-in-3-years/1832):\n\n![qejfil7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5424181/eca38c18-8299-11e4-9d48-5cd940ac77a2.png)\n love to help fix this bug but will need some pointers.  I am quite the newbie\n So here's where the date gets assigned: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/ladder/MyMatchesTabView.coffee#L70-L70\n\nYou'd insert some `console.log` statements to see what's up with that date and why it thinks it's three years from now. (Is the date wrong? Is now wrong?) You'd probably want to make sure you can reproduce the bug first, too.\n\nYou'd do this after [setting up the dev environment](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment) and probably submitting and simulating a few games for your local database.\n Thanks nwinter for the great pointers.  I will get things set up tonight and give it a go.  I will also work on a list for graphics bug.\n  Great, thanks @Imperadeiro98!\n  Awesome, it all looks great!\n @Imperadeiro98 I've just been thinking about how great a job you've been doing at managing the `pt-PT` i18n. Do you have any interest in becoming a committer and helping me check out and merge in other Diplomats' i18n pull requests?\n Wonderful! I've invited you to the Archmagi team, which should let you commit to this repo and accept pull requests and such things. I think you are pretty familiar with the process by now. The one thing you can't do yet is check whether someone has signed the CLA; I'll set up a process where you can do that soon.\n @Imperadeiro98 Also, let me know if you want a HipChat account; some of us tend to hang out in there all the time. http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa\n Great; just let me know your email address so I can invite you.

It looks like that infinite achievement popup bug is back\u2013that was just IE, right?\n2. Why is it on the left, not the right?\n\nI turned it off for now in IE in 5a66a91, so hope that helps, but we could maybe get them working again.\n I had a lot of students choosing Code Combat for the hour of code, and a bunch of them had the infinite achievement popup bug.  We only use IE (because certain chrome extensions allowed students around our security).  The popups were all on the right of the screen, NOT the left.  And they all had the signup message.\n Possibly a dupe of #1616.\n Yes, it looks like the same problem to me.\n  I've just completed the Arcane Ally level and gained access to Miss Hushbaum (the first magic char). But when i choose a Touch of the Death level (next to Arcane Ally) and clicked on this hero, i have only the restricted_title on big button and no possibility to buy/unlock it.

But may I suggest making two separate pull requests?\n ok sure , but i am thinking to increase in height of button and separate sentence in to two parts rather then increase in a width . give me your suggestion .\n Although you should speak to someone else, I'm not sure we'll want to increase the height of the button specifically - maybe decrease the margins so it does go to two lines?\nJust my views, http://i.imgur.com/gKk6bhy.png\n yeah , i saw that pic , i also want to do something like that .\n 2) I think, it's really hard to make them smaller. Also, I really don't think that current variant of translation is long - it's 5 or 6 letters longer than en-variant\n i think so if we break this sentence in two part , and slightly reduce fond along with increase height of button . then it will fit . let me try this idea . i will upload a pic after testing  it locally .\n I changed the button's height but can anyone help me about how can i separate this sentence into two line . after comma.\n This issue is solved, probably due to an updated translation.\n![solved](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6682655/6432733/1a51788e-c082-11e4-8a5c-7e27fc744b45.png)\n  Bonus for using under six lines of code.

It's not actually counting lines of code, though, it's counting unique statements of code. So here, `self.pos.x + 13` is a statement, `x = [the result of that]` is a statement, etc. It gets kind of complicated what counts as a statement.\n\nMaybe it would be better to make it count lines instead, and have better rules for what's a line, but we don't have a really good solution yet.\n Also related: #1808\n #2612 is Linked\n   Thanks for translating that, @meritrapa\u2013can I get you to [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla) so I can merge this in?\n  Thanks @Imperadeiro98, fast as ever!\n  Added some translations and fixed spelling errors.\n Thanks for adding those translations, @jmigual!

They do not get the covered flags. Thus they show up again for me at the top, and according to Nick they are not filled in at all. The chat does show them as saved and my browser of course shows them to be filled in ... but they keep coming up as still not covered.\n\nEaxamples for this behaviour are:\n\nAccepted a patch\nArcane Ally complete\nBack to Back clean Code\n\nall with the de-DE translation.\n ![unauthorized](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8407434/5331610/b341f4c0-7e32-11e4-9e6c-fb3b15ea1a7b.png)\n![lacking](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8407434/5331611/b4eb7832-7e32-11e4-83d8-edbf52ed4df5.png)\n\nOh and those two warnings are showing up sometimes. They MIGHT be connected to the improper saving bug... Maybe it's just one bug, and I just don't always get a warning?\n I unset the i18n from Tower Destruction, since it's an unpublished level. Not sure why the achievements aren't always saving, though. @sderickson when you have time later, can you check it out?\n Its not jut the achievemts, I saw the same behaviour also with thangs and other articles.\n 401 Unauthorized is a fairly rarely used error on the server. I think the only way you'd get that is if, somehow, you stop being logged in, maybe by clearing cookies. I've made it so that these noty errors output more info, which hopefully will clarify that's the case.\n\nI'd imagine the 403's are happening if two people try to translate the same document at the same time. It's a translation race condition. [These lines here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/i18n/I18NEditModelView.coffee#L139-L153) determine if the client should try to save a new version or submit a patch. First translators can just submit a new version, everyone else must patch. But if two clients think their both the first translators, the second submitter will get a 403, I believe.\n\nThis still doesn't explain the silent failures you're seeing. It's possible the errors happen without you realizing they do. I've made it so the button text says \"submitting...\" until something happens, so make sure you leave the page only after the button no longer says \"submitting...\", maybe that will help clarify things.\n When Achievements are translated, the following error appears:\n\"Error saving First Level Translation: 422 Unprocessable Entity id should not be included.\"\n Will this ever be fixed?\n Okay I think this should fix the errors @Imperadeiro98 was seeing. If there are further problems saving after these changes, we'll reopen this.\n  Thanks @Imperadeiro98!\n  Is this on the local server or codecombat.com? If it's on the local server, you might want to delete your `codecombat/public` folder and restart brunch after pulling to make sure that everything has been recompiled properly.\n I think I just got this one; the `en.coffee` file wasn't being included, so it wasn't possible to fallback to English translations.\n  If I try to fork \"burl\" it says \"Error saving Burl2: 401: Unauthorized\"\nand another message in red: \"Error: Uncaught Syntax Error: Unexpected Token M\nCheck the console for more\"\nconsole says:\"WebSocket connection to 'ws://codecombat.com:9485/' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT\njquery.js:8623 POST http://codecombat.com/db/thang.type 401 (Unauthorized)\nCocoModel.coffee:149 going to log an error message\nCocoModel.coffee:150 Error saving burl2 undefined\nburl:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token M\"\nif it fails to save/fork because im unauthorized, there's no problem\n Only admins have the capability of adding new ThangTypes for now, since we don't have a good permissions / publishing solution on them yet.

I've must have tried this over 20 times today and yesterday, and won ALL of them. \n\nThat can't be right..\n the second is because a lot of the players are using flag-moves to win. But if you click that link, I think the flags of the enemy aren't loaded and the enemy does somethimes quite none or tactical bad actions. The same thing happened some times at my leaderboard, too.\nI don't know what the problem of the first task is. Is there any red box saying \"Error saving code\" or something?\n Actually, the flags aren't used in the async ladder games (which are what the rankings are made of), so that can't be it. @ebirkenes what programming language are you using? I'm guessing that something is up with your sessions where they aren't being simulated properly\u2013did you ever try the synchronous PVP for that level?\n Returning 404s or bogus json objects in response to level.session or thang.type causes the simulation software to lock up.  So whatever is going on here is more subtle than simple network failures.\n More data.  Rerunning the bad match ups in the simulator (tested in chrome and IE) gives correct/reasonable results.\n I've noticed that when i lose a match and click it to see it. I typically always win the match. \n  Not going to worry about Sync PVP bugs right now.\n  Played [The Final Kithmaze](http://codecombat.com/play/level/the-final-kithmaze) and had the following code (using Lua). This completes the level but doesn't give the bonus for `under 12 statements`\n\n```\nfor i=1,4,1 do\n  self:moveRight()\n  self.moveUp()\n  local enemy=self:findNearestEnemy()\n  self:attack(enemy)\n  self:attack(enemy)\n  self:moveRight()\n  self:moveDown()\nend\n```\n Sorry about that! This is the same as this problem: https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/73#issuecomment-64815848 \u2013 basically, statement counting isn't consistent in Lua and Clojure compare to JS and Python. (Not sure how Io and CoffeeScript are counting right now.)\n coffeescript is counting correctly as far as i can remember that\n also in js, this code doesn't award the objective:\n\n``` javascript\nloop {\n    this.moveXY(this.pos.x + 12, this.pos.y);\n    var preAttackPos = {x: this.pos.x, y: this.pos.y + 12};\n    this.moveXY(preAttackPos.x, preAttackPos.y);\n    this.attack(this.findNearestEnemy());\n    this.moveXY(preAttackPos.x + 12, preAttackPos.y);\n    this.moveXY(this.pos.x, this.pos.y - 24);\n    this.moveXY(this.pos.x, this.pos.y + 12);\n}\n```\n This one doesn't work for under 6 statements in The Gauntlet, either:\n\n``` javascript\nloop {\n    this.moveRight();\n    this.attack(this.findEnemies()[0]); \n}\n```\n #2612 is Linked\n Also for \"the gauntlet\", this 6 line snippet grants the \"Bonus: under 6 statements\", where it probably should not:\n\nloop:\n    enemy = self.findNearestEnemy()\n    if enemy:\n        self.attack(enemy)\n    else:\n        self.moveRight()\n Second Kithmaze, user lost bonus because of `1` counting as an extra statement.\n\n``` python\nloop:\n    self.moveRight(1)\n    self.moveUp(1)\n    self.moveRight(1)\n    self.moveDown(1)\n```\n  Not worrying about sync PVP stuff right now.\n  The original idea there, I think, was to not let you see other players' code on ladder matches. Instead, you just get their transpiled code. I think the permissions problem was happening because you had never submitted your code to the ladder?\n  (Using Javascript) \n\nFor example if I type `this.fi` it gives me the option to press tab to autocomplete the statement with `findNearestEnemy();`\n\nGreat, but it deletes my `this.` instead of leaving it in place and showing `this.findNearestEnemy();`\n\n![screen shot 2014-11-23 at 4 27 59 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3149184/5159949/c3a0f7c2-732d-11e4-9da8-832fff03533a.png)\n![screen shot 2014-11-23 at 4 28 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3149184/5159948/c3a0e1f6-732d-11e4-9b3e-bb4597773feb.png)\n  I have code that won't load because of an assumed infinite loop.

Januar 2015 18:03\nAn: \"codecombat/codecombat\" codecombat@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"Gian S.\" gian.sass@outlook.de\nBetreff: Re: [codecombat] Comments to code for infinite loops (#1788)\n\nNeed to update [this code](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/TomeView.coffee#L80-L86) to use the right return syntax per language. Probably want to move the comment logic into SpellView, where we know which language the spell is in and have the [comment regex](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L782-L782) ready and all that.\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/1788#issuecomment-69462804\n You may close this issue @nwinter, I think the last commit fixed it.\n  moveXY currently runs in a choppy fashion if I attempt to break the moves into pieces.  I want to be able to check things again after 3 meters so I make sure I'm only moving 3 at a time, but it seems that now my hero accelerates and decelerates every time, thus causing very choppy movement.  Would be nice to have the old move concept back so that he will just move smoothly.\n This is also the same problem that is happening with `move`: in between movement actions, there's a frame or two of yielding where the hero idles. Need to get it to work continuously.\n  I got the Email from Multiplayer  info Email about my stats and it Said Lost to (playername) won against (same name). this might be caused by the fact you win and lose weather the Enemy placed Flags or not. So i think it would be the Most Easy if the code Senats the Email ignores a player already shown in Loss category, because everything else would effect the flag System or the replay Match while user is online possibility.\n  In the level editor, when you delete all of a certain doodad, the folder containing them should disappear instead of sticking around with (0) Thangs in it.\n ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2559382/5206218/b2f28d12-7564-11e4-8ec9-0b7fcbaa70c9.png)\n\nAre you talking about this view?\n Yup. If you delete all of a Thang (not by deleting the folder), it will stick around like \"Movement Stone (0)\" or \"Doodad (0)\".\n Cool. I've confirmed the behavior. I'm not super familiar with the code structure. Where would the logic for this live?\n Maybe somewhere around here? https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs/ThangsTabView.coffee#L477-L516\n So can we add something to deleteSelectedExtantThang that repopulates the folders?\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs/ThangsTabView.coffee#L470-L475\n Could work; give it a shot!\n Ok so by adding these [two lines](https://github.com/keenanjohnson/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs/ThangsTabView.coffee#L476-L477) to the delete function, it rebuilds the thang folder structure when a thang is deleted. \n\nHowever, it collapses the folders each time something is deleted. I'm not really sure the best way to solve this or if I can delete the element without causing the collapse?\n Anyone had a chance to look at this? @nwinter \n Noticed this issue again. Additionally, the value of the parent of the current folder isn't updated (it says there are 6 thangs, when there are none) and it is not deleted too when the thangs' value reaches 0.\n![entries are not deleted](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/17677856/8c470a32-632c-11e6-8ac7-a22e619adba4.png)\n  See [this forum thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/level-not-loading/1431). @differentmatt I thought we fixed this?\n Names aren't guaranteed to exist, I guess.\n  Some times a map random generated, and there is some coins or enemy placed around collision, but I still can find them by findnearestItem or findnearestenemy, so the hero always try to move and I can't cancel the action.\n  The achievement system is not working, so when you have completed a level or more you don't get the achievement.  [Picture of bug](http://prntscr.com/592q7c)\n @sderickson I'm seeing some of these work for new efforts after the bug you got the other day, but they don't work for recalculating. Here's the achievement coverage for an account I have which beat a bunch of levels before the fix, then had recalculation happen and beat one more level plus did the misc patch/simulating stuff after the fix:\n\n![screenshot 2014-12-11 17 57 36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/5405844/54384d00-815f-11e4-9865-cd934dc3643a.png)\n\nSo apart from \"edited a level component\" being fired for me translating something instead, it looks good. But how can we make it retroactive so that the players who have beaten a bunch of levels get the 5- and 20-level achievements (and possibly any translation/contribution achievements they should have gotten)?\n Hey there, I have a similar problem, none of the achievements except the signup:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4030090/5604635/8e152062-937e-11e4-8f6c-5edf1d080bf5.png)\n\nPerhaps the level achievements could be rewarded retroactively by making them rewards for beating specific levels, rather than a set number of levels.\n  Does it work for all others? i don't have Senick Steelclaw, but it worked on the first 3 characters that you can have. Maybe it's not that the code it messed up, it just might be something else instead of self.attack(enemy)\n I think the bullets might be bouncing off of the trees or something; I haven't tried to reproduce it myself yet, but that's the first thing that comes to mind.\n  We could also fix/bring back the full screen button for hero levels. We could also try to expand the spell palette (\"Your Skills\" / \"Help\") below the rest of the UI, make it have a max height and scroll, etc.\n  In game menu I saw this bug, where the scroll bar is covering the X button:\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/5126747/664b6d40-70c7-11e4-832c-04181187b70c.png)\n I'm not sure if you can consider that a fix. Seems more like a temporary workaround that results in another issue (#2031).\n  This has the result that all the dead units get up in order to die again. I would have said it's probably something to do with world streaming chunks improperly setting `actionActivated` to `true`, but now just looking at when it happened, it doesn't reproduce when scrubbing past the same point on the same run again, so maybe it is something to do with real-time playback instead?\n https://app.asana.com/0/15388757953815/20686183437360\n This happens when spritesheets are rerendered after resizing everything to a smaller spritesheet: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/LayerAdapter.coffee#L294 \u2013 maybe we need to maintain old animation frames when rerendering? At least rerender less often.\n @sderickson how hard to maintain old animation frames when rerendering?\n  @schmatz Can you update the scripts to include achievements?\n Will do. \n I've fixed this. Please reopen if I made a mistake.\n  Upon visiting codecombat.com I found myself logged into a stranger's account. There is no way someone else logged into their account from my computer, unless I got hacked, so I strongly suspect that this is the consequence of a bug in codecombat. I'd be happy to help with troubleshooting this.\n That's worrisome! Can you describe more about your internet connection, like any proxies you may be behind? Also, do you still see the stranger's account if you go there now, and if so, do you see it if you go to [direct.codecombat.com](http://direct.codecombat.com)?\n Now I'm not logged into any account anymore. I have signed up for and logged into my own account in the meantime, though only in an incognito window in chrome as to avoid overwriting any cookies. Idk if that logged me out of the stranger's account because of something that happened server-side. I am not behind any proxy.\n\nAnother weird thing that happened is that when I created my account (just now), I found a whole bunch of levels already played, and Javascript selected as the language of choice, which is odd seeing as it's not the default. Somehow, similar to the previous bug, someone else's profile seems to have been merged with my newly created one. I really have no clue how this happened, but feel free to ask me anything.\n\nBtw, I could not login or sign up via Github - after granting access to codecombat I was always returned to the home page without being logged in.  \n I just had the same problem now, logged through Github and found myself  logged in as another user. \n\nI'm not behind proxies. After looking at this thread, I eliminated codecombat cookies, tried direct.codecombat.com with Github account, and got a a page from codecombat.com only saying: \"Forbidden\". Then I went to codecombat.com, logged in with github and found again myself logged in as another user. \n\nTo end the story, I just created a new code combat account, then everything went fine :-)\n  When playing one of the new levels and using the submit button, after it runs I'm met with this dialog:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/4992370/722473f8-69da-11e4-8e06-ffdf7afc70b4.png)\n\nI don't have the option to just return to the code, I'm forced to return to the ladder, then reload the page.\n https://app.asana.com/0/15388757953815/20686183437363\n Yep. seen this as well. I just press escape though\n Even after so much redesigning, this is still a (frustrating) issue, by the way. The `Esc` workaround works, but it is non-intuitive.\n\nAlso, there's no way to get back to the world map, the multiplayer game view only has a button to go back to the ladder view.\n Oh, nice to hear that. :smile:\nI've just opened an unrelated user experience issue (#3215), I wonder if the next redesign already covers that?\n After pressing `Esc` you can then press the browsers back button and it should load up the campaign you were just in before starting the level.  \n\nNow I don't know if this causes issues with how the game state is being tracked by the web application, but it should at least get the student back to the campaign area.\n @Harry-the-Wanderer CoCo is not a SPA and does not intercept the back button navigation as far as I know. When navigating back to the campaign view, I believe the application sends an uncached request to fetch the player information, so it should work properly.\n This might be a hack, but why not just create a hyperlinked button on the multiplayer level complete screen that just creates a browsers back button effect.  So when you click on the \"button\" all it really does is a window.history.back(); effect or similar.\n @Harry-the-Wanderer the problem with `history.back()` is that it won't work when you open the level in a new tab. I guess it could work for most cases, though it is not the ideal solution.\n Oh, that's good to know, my bad! \ud83d\ude05\n\nI knew about Backbone, but really, CoCo does not feel very much like a SPA\u2014the UI doesn't shake around nor slows down when transitioning views, there's hardly any of the bugs or quirks typically found in SPAs (such as memory leaks, broken back/forward navigation or accumulated event listeners). I may have to take a second look at Backbone sometime soon.\n  Fixed because of a0876634588c27d6e6a958230258a9c947d0d329 changes to Router.\n  I have started working on this one, but can't push until I finish with my wrecking ball.\n  Hello!\n\nI've just started to play the Dungeon campaign in CodeCombat. I tried to restart \"Gems in the deep\" because I made by accident some kind of mistake and I were not avaible to achieve bonus for code without mistakes. Unfortunately something gone wrong and now I can't play any level from Forest and Dungeon campaign. I receive message \"Infinite Loop detected\". I don't know what I did wrong because I played that level only few seconds. None of three options works. Thank you in advance for help. My CodeCombat nickname: Acererak.\n I just checked it out with your account details, but I'm not sure what's causing it, since I can't reproduce. Can you [open up the JS console](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console#opening_the_console) and let me know what error messages it's saying when it shows the \"Infinite Loop Detected\" warning? Should look like this:\n\n![screenshot 2014-11-05 08 02 37](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/4920816/30c6c840-6505-11e4-8901-4c3c15ca26c3.png)\n I tried another Web browser (Opera) and to my surprise (because that bug was there, too), I could change the code but there is no sound. I completed that level and tried to start next one. The site tries to send me communicate about infinite loop, but the browers blocks it and I am able to play. I restarted my computer and tried to log in using my previous browser, IE11 (where I have sound) and it works. Issue is solved so you can close this thread.\n\nedit: It worked only one time on IE. . I can't write what error messages gives the console because it shows completely nothing.\n![codecombat](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9573072/4923387/2c1af608-651a-11e4-9695-334e922bd022.jpg)\n\nOn Opera CodeCombat still works without sound and in addition I don't see level now. There are only shadows and grey field.\n![codecombat](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9573072/4923553/a96046d0-651b-11e4-93f4-7ca0306cc8e7.jpg)\n Are you still seeing this one? I've made a bunch of improvements, but not sure I got whatever was causing this.\n Yes - on Opera I still see that grey field and don't hear music. Fortunately, on Internet Explorer I don't receive the error message anymore. I still hear error sound when I start a level but I can play. The only problem is codecombat doesn't show me which levels I completed while playing on IE. I see them as if I only started playing them (on Opera it shows them normally as completed). However when I unlock a new level I am able to play, so the problem seems mostly solved so far.\n Actually, we just solve the Internet Explorer bug; I need to deploy it now. So this is really just that we need an unsupported browser message for Opera.\n  Seems like the recent change to the getUserFnMap made this work now!\n  BIG Translation ! The most is translated !\n Ok, it's done ;) !\n        Autorun can be translated, but it would fit far worse than Autorun itself.Thats why i left it unchanged.\nCheers\n  I want to point out that any (including the non hero levels) of the levels' name or description are being translated (despite they are in the level editor).\n\nAlso \"Gems in The Deep\" and \"Shadow Guard\" are locked (don't know if it is intended or not).\n 1-Ok.\n\n2-Yes, it shows as complete. And then, the levels prior to those work just fine.\n Yes, I hit submit and they are now unlocked again.\n It keeps happening every time I go to the Campaign.\n It no longer reproduces.\n   Yes! Did that nick!\nThanks for getting me started. :)\n\nOn Fri, Oct 24, 2014 at 8:49 PM, Nick Winter notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hey @richhiey1996 https://github.com/richhiey1996, thanks for adding\n> that\u2013glad to get you started!

Now I go back to the menu and Reload code and I have nice javascript code and am running in javascript.\n\nOption 2, I decide now that I've solved with javascript that I want to change to python.\n A. I switch language to python and hit the reload all button:  \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/4415943/985ab416-4535-11e4-92b1-b18626f12a1d.png)\n B.

It would be kinda nice if each language had its own \"levels\". For example, every new language completely starts you over and locks the levels again.

What's the difference? Why do they have different number of arguments? Any help would be appreciated!\n @differentmatt Also, what's the indentation rules for CoffeeScript? I already googled it, but no luck...\n Just a note, Clojure does have a `while (true) { ... }` equivalent, try this on the [parser demo](http://vickychijwani.github.io/closer.js/):\n\n``` clojure\n(while true\n  (alert \"sdf\"))\n```\n To make CoffeeScript easier to deal with, would it be possible to convert it behind the scenes to JavaScript and then run that? Or is that too time intensive?\n We aren't going to do simple loops going forward, so we don't need to get it working for CoffeeScript.\n  As I spectated a match, on load of the site the invisible wizards (the two of the coders and the one of me/the spectator) were all on the left bottom, names overlaped and just past loading they were on their normal position.\nThis could be longer as on other devices because low RAM for the internet explorer.\n  @differentmatt\nI am interested in working on this issue. I am a newbie, so it would be very helpful if you could attach some screenshots of how you want it to look like and suggest what a good instructional message would be.\n @differentmatt Thanks!

Thanks!\n  \"I occasionally run across a bug where, when first opening the level while playing against an opponent, it gives me a message that I've won even though I've lost\" - David Beckly\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8581710/4233571/ec493dac-39ac-11e4-8aef-2aeff5e35f51.png)\n I think this happens when the victory script from the previous time you opened the level still hasn't finished clearing itself, so you see it again when you open the next level (even if that level is a loss).\n  Things like being able to localize the recovery password emails, error messages, and other strings that the server generates would come in handy.\n Would be interested in tackling this problem. Could you give me a few hints where those things are generated and if the english text is stored somewhere.\n On the client, we use [i18next](http://i18next.com/), and it has an API like this:\r\n\r\n``` coffeescript\r\n$.i18n.t('home.slogan')  # -> 'Learn to Code by Playing a Game'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks at the [currently selected language](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/core/RootView.coffee#L104-L104) and grabs the right strings from the preferred [locale file](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/locale), falling back to English if it's not found.\r\n\r\nOn the server, we have access to the locale files and could make a simple API to do the same thing based on `req.user.get('preferredLanguage')`. We might put it [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/lib/utils.coffee). Then we could just use it whenever we wanted to generate a string on the server, like [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server/middleware/auth.coffee).\r\n Ok nick. I would like to understand the requirements more in brief. \nIf we are creating a new API, what is the url desired for the same ? and we are passing the 'home.slogan' as query parameter only , right ? Correct me if i am wrong.\nAlso , I am wondering why we are making this an API ? Can't we just create a utility function that does this job at client side functions itself ? Why translations are required at server side ?\n\nConsidering that API will be used basically to translate the strings. \n1 ) We extract user preferredLanguage as you mentioned and then convert the given string to that preferredLanguage. OR\n2 ) We give another parameter to api which is desiredLanguage and then convert the given string to that desiredLanguage. \nI see option 2 as more generic and might be used in wider scope. (Don't actually the use cases as i didnt go through the code where you use such translations)\n  Playing criss-cross, I cannot reassign (or modify in-place) the properties of an object passed in as a parameter from within the function body.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nfunction replaceArr(thing) {\n    thing.arr = [\"xyz\"];\n}\n\nfunction pushArr(thing) {\n    thing.arr.push(\"foo\");\n}\n\nvar foo = { arr: [] };\n//replaceArr(foo);\n//pushArr(foo);\n\nreturn null;\n```\n\nIf I uncomment the replaceArr call, I get:\n\n`Line 2, time 0.6: Cannot assign to read only property 'arr' of Anya`\n\nIf I uncomment the pushArr call, no error occurs but `foo.arr` is not modified.\n\nI guess this is another symptom of the API protection issues with Aether similar to #1459.\n Right, this one might be more tricky, because the only way we would know that you have permission to mess with the contents of that would be to realize that you had also created not only the top-level `foo` object, but its `arr` array member, and then decide not to protect it. Hmm.\n\nI wonder if we can look for object/array initialization literals and tag those with some sort of `__skipAPIProtection` property or something like that, which isn't recursive (so you can't just do `var hehe = {target: enemy}; hehe.target.health = -9001;`).\n\nThen if you create a new object by doing something like, `var myCoins = this.getItems().slice();` to create a non-API-protected copy, we would want the same thing: to not protect the result, but to keep protecting any children. ... I guess the difference there is that we might be able to tell which methods are actually API methods whose return values need protecting (like `this.getItems()`) versus which are normal JS methods or user-created methods (like `slice()`).\n\n@differentmatt Do you think we could make things simpler by marking (manually, if needed) which functions are part of a protected API and then do less (no?) protection on their return values or arguments?\n Another example from [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/js-pass-by-reference/1113/2) (I think):\n\n``` javascript\nvar tree = [];\nfor(var i=0; i < 49; i++)\ntree[i] = -1;\n\ntree[49] = 49;\ntree[50] = 50;\n\nthis.testFunction = function(tree)\n{\ntree[17] = 17;\nthis.debug(\"Tree entry 17 = \"+tree[17],tree);\n};\n\nthis.testFunction(tree);\n\nfor(i=0;i<51; i++)\nthis.debug(\"array[\"+i+\"] = \"+ tree[i]);\n```\n Should be fixed with @basicer's new Esper interpreter.\n  This bug might be too user-specific for anyone to want to take a look at... but here goes. I have a line that gets an array of the neutral tiles for the current turn's tileGroupLetter:\n\n``` javascript\nvar tiles = this.tileGroups[tileGroupLetter].filter(function(tile) { return !tile.owner;});\n```\n\nIt works perfectly every turn, every round, of every match, so I don't think it's a bug in my code.\nHowever, in round 0, turn 17 (tile group C) of my human match against skeltoac, the filter returns a list of 3 tiles, when there should be 5.\nWhat's worse is that one of the un-returned tiles (6.3) would eventually give me the win, but I don't bid on it because I don't see it.\n\n![bogus-skeltoac](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3856948/4175555/a248859e-35da-11e4-9b52-597dc3b43973.png)\n\nHere's a code snippet of some debug code I've added to run on that turn:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.debug(\"TILE GROUPS\",this.tileGroups);\nfor(var ii=6;ii >= 0;--ii)\n{\n    var tt = this.tileGroups[this.tgl][ii];\n    this.debug(\"check tile...\",ii,tt);\n    if(typeof tt == \"undefined\" || undefined == tt) {\n        continue;\n    }\n\n    if(tt.owner === null) tiles2.push(tt);\n    else\n    {\n        if(this.debugCalcBid) this.debug(\"Not considering tile\",tt.id,tt.owner);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's what I get when I debug this.tileGroups (with specific items expanded):\n\n_TILE GROUPS \nObject {A: Array[7], D: Array[7], C: Array[7], G: Array[7], F: Array[7]\u2026}\nA: Array[7]\nB: Array[7]\nC: Array[7]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;0: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;1: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;2: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;3: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;4: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;5: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apiProperties: Array[6]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id: \"4.6\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors: Array[5]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;owner: null\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tileGroupLetter: \"C\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x: 4\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y: 6\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proto: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;6: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apiProperties: Array[6]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id: \"6.3\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbors: Array[5]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;owner: null\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tileGroupLetter: \"C\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x: 6\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y: 3\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proto: Object\n&nbsp;&nbsp;length: 7\nproto: Array[0]\nD: Array[7]\nE: Array[7]\nF: Array[7]\nG: Array[7]_\n\nEntries 6 and 5 in tileGroups[\"C\"] should be tiles 6.3 and 4.6, however, when I access them via tileGroups[\"C\"][6] and tileGroups[\"C\"][5] I get undefined:\n\n_check tile... 6 undefined app.js:85\ncheck tile... 5 undefined app.js:85_\n\nThe rest of the entries show up fine:\n\n_check tile... 4 \nObject {owner: null, x: 4, y: 5, id: \"4.5\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}\ncheck tile... 3 \nObject {owner: null, x: 4, y: 2, id: \"4.2\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}\ncheck tile... 2 \nObject {owner: \"humans\", x: 3, y: 2, id: \"3.2\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}\nNot considering tile 3.2 humans \ncheck tile... 1 \nObject {owner: null, x: 0, y: 6, id: \"0.6\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}\ncheck tile... 0 \nObject {owner: \"humans\", x: 0, y: 2, id: \"0.2\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}\nNot considering tile 0.2 humans_\n\nSo after my filter() call, i end up with a list containing tiles [4.5, 4.2, 0.6].\n\nIf I use this.getTile() on that turn, it **does** find the tiles for me:\n\n_Direct tile access... \nObject {owner: null, x: 6, y: 3, id: \"6.3\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}\nObject {owner: null, x: 4, y: 6, id: \"4.6\", apiProperties: Array[6]\u2026}_\n\nSo a possible work around would be to build my own tileGroups arrays using getTile().. but that's bogus.\n I think I know what's going on here; I've got the bug on my list. It won't be an easy fix, though. I'm hoping to get it early next week if all goes well.\n That's good news. I did implement the workaround, and it's working as expected. I guess I'll pull that code out once this issue is resolved.\n\nAny chance I could help with a fix, or would it take longer to explain what's going on that it would to fix it?\n @mdzw Try again\u2013are you still seeing the bug now?\n I disabled the workaround a while ago in case it was causing me some slowdowns (don't want to hit the execution limit). I haven't seen this bug happen since then.\n\nCurrently my code is undefeated, so if the bug is still present, it's not making me lose any matches ;)\n Looks like this one is not squashed. My current human match against HighSea's ogre seems to exhibit similar behavior. There are turns where I don't place any bid when I should.\n\nI re-enabled my workaround, and I end up winning the match. However, it seems that there are some other API protection violations that are happening, because I still see the weird non-bidding. I hope it's not intentional :)\n Haha unless i have inadvertently introduced an API violation in my own code.. I don't think that's the case but I'll keep looking.\n I've taken a closer look at it and I think I've introduced a bug in my own code.. sorry for the false alarm :(\n  Lanner's Strategy: Create nothing but Anya's and have them sit behind the human commander spamming the field with razor disks. Unless players instruct minions to ignore attacking the commander and go after the heroes behind the commander the attackers will be overwhelmed with razor disks before they get a chance to kill the commander.\n\nThe problem: When I adjusted for this strategy and took out the Anya's  the game would \"take too long or hit an infinite loop\". Even when I simplified my code down to just a few lines it still would error out. Not sure what is causing the error. It tends to happen right around the time the first Anya would die and the send Anya would spawn. And only happens when the ogre's have a mass of people around the human spawn.\n\nThe ogre code that causes the error (I had an even simpler version but it doesnt seem to matter):\n\n``` python\nbuildOrder = ['munchkin', 'munchkin', 'munchkin', 'thrower']\nbuildType = buildOrder[len(self.built) % len(buildOrder)]\nif len(self.built) <100:\n    if self.buildables[buildType].goldCost <= self.gold:\n        self.build(buildType)\n\nenemies = self.getEnemies()\n\nminions = self.getFriends()\nfor minion in minions:\n\n    # self.command(minion, 'move', {\"x\": 64, \"y\": 30})\n\n    if enemies[1]:   \n        self.command(minion, 'attack', enemies[1])\n    else:\n        self.command(minion, 'attack', enemies[0])\n\n#When the move command is used instead of attack to keep minions from swarming human spawn it does not freeze\n```\n A screenshot of the error a bit before I simplified my code down.\n\n![2014-09-04_13h44_53](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8581710/4154492/0494c4a8-3462-11e4-8237-024ddbe98be7.png)\n I think I was seeing a bug related to this the other day. One of Anya's abilities somehow seems to be able to trigger some Thang to have `NaN`s in its velocity, which then, through the collision/movement updating system 1) quickly propagates to every other Thang and 2) slows the game to a halt. I need to figure out which one of Anya's abilities has this bad code and what the bug is, but I haven't tracked it down yet. I guess the fix I put in the other day didn't actually solve it.\n  Recent reports indicate that CodeCombat no longer loads in Internet Explorer, even 11. Not sure how long that's been going on, but it shouldn't be too hard to get it working again. (Our targets are 9-11, although 9 probably has more problems due to lack of web workers.)\n May I help with this?\n If you have Internet Explorer 11 running, you could help post some screenshots and descriptions of the problem\u2013I myself am not quite sure what the problem is, since I don't usually run Windows.\n  The tutorial says \"Have your archers use their attack spell on any ogre enemies they see\".\nSo I changed my code to this...\n\n```\nvar enemy = this.getNearestEnemy();\n\nif(enemy) {\n    // An enemy unit is visible to the archer.\n    this.say('I see ' +enemy.id);\n    this.attack(enemy);\n} \nelse {\n    // No enemies in sight\n    // IMPORTANT: hover over the map for coordinates, shift+click to insert\n    this.move({x:40, y:65}); // absolute, not relative\n}\n```\n\nThe archers all say that they see the enemy, and the enemy is out of range so they should (according to the function description) move towards it.  However, they just stand still and don't fire any arrows :-(\n\nUnfortunately this makes it very difficult to progress through the tutorial!\n\n![brailwood_tutorial](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1869270/4122851/ad6a8f9a-32c8-11e4-8532-27fa1380c6dc.png)\n some details: the archers are blueand the archers are targeting the ogre out of range although the thrower is the nearest enemy\n\ntry using\nthis.move({x: 40, y: 75});\nit works at me using your code, but my archers are red\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8473563/4153280/df11f80a-3456-11e4-9d2c-d6ff0a9aab6d.png)\n  Appears to be some bug in Ogre gold calculation.\n\n![brailwood_tutorial](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1869270/4122579/06f177de-32c6-11e4-8895-c1f4b769a69e.png)\n  This is valid Python:\n\n![valid-python](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/887446/4104144/d1ce6444-3181-11e4-9f58-c2ba197c054c.png)\n\nThe error message goes away if you switch the functions, but it would be nice if this error message were just smarter (especially since the `this` object doesn't even have a `foo` function defined!)\n    Added commit 3dd888469e737396493df4132ead581efa3344db as an example\n i think, you haven't done it yet :) don't want to open a new issue, just noticed it in victory window\n![default](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1132840/5409689/20d5e2de-81fe-11e4-992f-b5bee958571d.PNG)\n[Unholy Tome I] has the translation. \n @Imperadeiro98 are there any remaining places in the site you know about that don't already have their own specific issues here?\n   @nwinter, could you then propagate?\nBy the way, can't you make it possible to automatically propagate when en.coffee is changed?\n Ok, didn't thought about that.\n  Tried using a more common norwegian than a direct translation from english to make it easier to read for all ages.

Looking at your example code, I would say that's expected behaviour --- `splice` returns the elements removed from the array (in this case, no elements), which you assign back to `this.test`. To get the result you are expecting, you should ignore the return value of `splice`, as your array will be modified in-place to insert the new value.\n  CodeCombat\nDEUTSCH (DEUTSCHLAND)\nSpielen\nCommunity\nAccount\nBanner2\n\nTurnier endet in a month\nWin bids, construct paths, outwit opponents, grab gems, and upgrade your career in our Criss-Cross tournament!

The `splice` call in my example could be replaced with `unshift`, which inserts an element at the start, but that's not the point.\n Fixed with @basicer's new Esper interpreter.\n  If you reduce the window size in the start menu or at the level list the account settings/login button and the language settings disappear at a specific width and smaller\n  Chrome, ip: http://codecombat.com/editor/level/money-fight\nAs it loaded the level some times this appeared in a red square and the load bar got stuck in like 1/6 of it\n\nerror: uncaught TypeError: Cannot read\nproperty 'programmableMethods' of\nundefined\nCheck the JS console for more\n\nJS Console:\n\nRegistering collection /db/level/money-fight/files \nt\nFunction feedDocument: 1.000ms\nLoad preferences: 18.000ms\nInsert Mini: 20.000ms\nRegistering collection /db/thang.type/names \nt\nLinkedin async init success!\nKnight couldn't find lc for \nObject\n of \nArray[36]\nKnight couldn't find lc for \nObject\n of \nArray[36]\nOgre Peon M couldn't find lc for \nObject\n of \nArray[36]\nOgre F couldn't find lc for \nObject\n of \nArray[36]\nGenerated random seed 5381 of type playerSession from sessionIDs \nArray[1]\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'programmableMethods' of undefined codecombat.com/editor/level/money-fight:50\nPosted 1 error to errorception.com\n thats the level i tried to fix the knights :/\n oh, ok thanks\n now it says i dont have enough permissions to open that level\n my fault, wrong account :/ by the way: it works, i can edit\n  If you play sky span as ogres the first time, you automatically beat the humans and may rank your code!

There are however some repositories with normalized social login buttons. Can I please use one of those or make my own buttons? They look a bit shaggy when put together.\n Not sure. As long as it's obvious it's for logging in it should be good. We could have 3 icons ligned up instead of the current \"log in\" fb and g+ icons. Either way a custom GitHub icon would look great for whatever Same reasons you have the other ones.\n  This pull request together with the latest [zatanna](https://github.com/dkundel/zatanna) update fixes all points discussed in #18 except of the first point.\n It also implements what we discussed in #1420\n Sure I can do that part. However then it wouldn't be support reassigned variables like `$this.` at the moment. At least if we would follow this approach. I'll continue reading into it today.\n I implemented a pretty basic implementation for now that will be implemented with the latest version of zatanna. I submitted a pull request #1446\n  @nwinter can you progragate the new i18n changes? \n I noticed that the description, in English, of the Lua language doesn't fit.\nI think, just for now, that the better thing to do would be making the text adjust to the box where it should fit.\n  Updated pt-PT description and added Catalan language.\n\nMade a big update to pt-PT.coffee!\n\n(By the way: where can I find the words \"Humans\" and \"Ogres\" for translation?)\n It isn't that bad. For now it can stay that way. But in the future, I wouldn't mind to do it (just need to know how to).\n  It's hard to find the submit patch option for Component changes.  Currently, the hidden option in the inner chevron should be used, rather than the visible save button for levels.\n\n![submitpatch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/3896283/682bff4a-2256-11e4-9dbc-4221a27ee697.png)\n\nCan we make this more obvious?\n\nFor example, we could pull the component submit patch option out of the drop down and into an inner save button, looking similar to the level save button.  And, put tool tips on both of the save buttons.  The level save button does not have a tool tip currently.\n  1. Indoor preset\n2. Better dungeon decorations\n3. Fixes issues with walls \n4. Preset images for indoor and dungeon\n  In line 432, is the string right?\n Ok, thanks for your answer.\n  So the main issue is that the UndoManager takes as the first state the empty editor and the next step where we place the code into the editor. So if I understand the bad documentation of Ace correctly we could just call the constructor of the UndoManager to create a new instance where the undo state is reset after we placed the code. I'm going to read in the actual code of Ace again to figure out if that works :)\n\nReference: http://ace.c9.io/#nav=api&api=undomanager\n Fixed. Will add it at all appropriate places and then submit a PR :)\n I read so much Ace source code for the Autocomplete fixing Ace issues became my new hobby :D just throw them at me ;)\n Can't we have some flag variable that is set if the script is active and else you just run an `editor.insert(' ')`? For example for the autocomplete I'm actually listening on <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> to re-tokenize the code for the smarter autocomplete. \n do we have a global flag or an event that i could subscribe to for an active script? then I could include the code.\n You want [script:state-changed](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/b3572dfad9f0d76ef5dcf7fb05530b625e98c3c4/app/lib/scripts/ScriptManager.coffee#L359-L364)\n  The database backup isn't setup properly by the Windows development environment [setup script](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment#windows_details).\n\nBrowser console error when navigating to http://localhost:300:\n\"NetworkError: 401 Unauthorized - http://localhost:3000/db/user\"\n\nDownloading the db backup and applying it manually fixed the environment.\n @differentmatt You install successfully on Windows yet?\n @jequal yes, I successfully installed on windows 8.

Last time, I copy past my code, but I prefer to avoid to do that each time :)\n I just try the level again.\nThe seed problem seems solved. If I press F5 to reload, I can get different seeds.\n\nBut my old code doesn't solved the problem anymore.\nAt least for one seed, there is a real problem.

Thanks!\n I will try once more, to see if I can reproduce, this time I will post here the code!\n  One of my programmer friend helped me checking it out. It seems okay. :) anyhow in case something is wrong, just let me know. \n I thank you, @schmatz ! You are really kind. :D\n  Hi. If there's anything to correct, just let me know. thanks. \n ?! It says Travis CI build could not complete due to an error...hmm....\n phew. now  it says the Travis CI build passed. \n I tried to find out what's wrong with it. I installed coco-dev-win-setup file and installed other many things required...I spent almost 3 hours with help of my friend(he is a developer) and I'm stuck. ;( My friend told me that he would try it on HIS desktop after he arrive his home... phew........ \n @schmatz  Hello. Thank you for detailed comment. I read every word of your comment!  Actually about a week ago Nick Winter told me something similar with your comment... and I made same mistake. Maybe I should be more careful when translate... anyway I really appreciate it!\n  Some more translations and fixes.\n  This is okay, but could be better:\n\n![screenshot 2014-07-25 14 50 26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3708621/bb1b5832-1445-11e4-8694-344f0c2c63fe.png)\n\nToo bad Bootstrap doesn't (appear to?) have undo/redo icons.\n I've previously been looking around for `table` and `grid` icons for the achievements page, so users could display achievements in more than one way.\n\n[MetroUI](http://metroui.org.ua/icons.html) has what we're both looking for and we can just include it's `iconFont.css` stylesheet. What do you think, do I have a green light?\n What would also work is [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/). Doesn't have a `redo` icon but the undo looks similar in style to ours.\n\n![](http://puu.sh/aEtuW/c9768af0dd.png)\n Alright checked them out, I'd seen them before. The free glyphicons come with a CC License which is just fine for CodeCombat. They're png images though, so I'll have to tweak those to work nicely inline like our usual bootstrap `<i>` icons do. \n\nEDIT: The PRO version includes the icons as a font. Royalty-free license though.. Wouldn't that mean it's Codecombat's as a company? Not sure whether developers are allowed to have those.\n I managed this with the provided free icons. Still want me to ask them?\n\n![](http://puu.sh/aEBCq/983aedf14b.png)\n\n```\n        li#undo-button(title=\"Undo (Ctrl+Z)\")\n          a\n            span.glyphicon.glyphicon-undo\n        li#redo-button(title=\"Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z)\")\n            a\n              span.glyphicon-redo.glyphicon\n```\n\nUse is exactly the same.\n The creator of glyphicons got back to me. I'll just quote him.\n\n> unfortunately GLYPHICONS  PRO and ALL licenses are not compatible with most of the open source >licenses (except Halflings or FREE version). If you want to share icons as a part of your product for >free, it would be better to use another icon pac, use FREE version or Halflings in Twitter Bootstrap.\n\nThat being said, I already checked out some fonts but probably not all of them. Most were unsatisfactory because they locked some icons. I'll check out some more later. On the other hand, I can continue with the images we got. Colors are regulated with an overlay filter like in my example (the original ones are all black). Though it's not the best way since all icons are separate image files, we have to do the silly filter, etc.\n I know this is old, but it's the first result when I google \"glyphicon undo\" so I'm going to put this here. You can use `glyphicon-repeat` (like the redo button shown at the top of this issue) and reverse it with the CSS `transform: scale(-1, 1);` and then it looks like a decent undo button.\n  I think that now that there are the different dialects of each language, there is no need to have the main one (and it has a lot of not translated strings, compared to the dialects).\n  All mentioned issues in #1279 should be now resolved with this pull request and #1380.\n You need to run `bower update` because the fix for the tests is in zatanna\n  For Anya's backstab there needs to be a way to determine a unit's heading, e.g. a `heading` property. Otherwise you have to try to deduce it from the units's target, which may not be possible if the unit is idling.\n  Autocomplete is now excluding content of strings or comments. \n\nStill TODO: disable suggestions within the comment section. However I still need to find a performant solution for this.\n Additionally you can toggle the Fullscreen view using: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Mac), <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (Win). The keyboard shortcuts are open for discussion :) \n  I've been having errors like this happen fairly frequently when results are being submitted back to the server for BrawlWood simulations...\n\nSending result back to server: app.js:524\n{\"taskID\":\"53ce682bb545016707f82fe3\",\"receiptHandle\":\"f2079613ea70029d8f960e1015247f60a4a21852\",\"originalSessionID\":\"53ab068bbfd56d35058722d4\",\"originalSessionRank\":0,\"calculationTime\":500,\"sessions\":[{\"sessionID\":\"53ab068bbfd56d35058722d4\",\"submitDate\":\"2014-07-21T22:28:08.392Z\",\"creator\":\"53aadac0f0e8233605340a63\",\"name\":\"Ryan Matte\",\"totalScore\":56.100871443038876,\"metrics\":{\"rank\":0}},{\"sessionID\":\"539c251430a67c3b05d95ee9\",\"submitDate\":\"2014-06-15T01:46:07.382Z\",\"creator\":\"539c0af1ab5dfc3a05cb19a9\",\"name\":\"takua108\",\"totalScore\":39.95499932335949,\"metrics\":{\"rank\":1}}],\"originalSessionTeam\":\"ogres\"} app.js:524\n|Quetzalcoatl's Archer| Headless simulation completed in 290469ms. app.js:59\nPUT http://codecombat.com/queue/scoring 500 (Internal Server Error) vendor.js:460\nTask registration error: {\"readyState\":4,\"responseText\":\"There was an error:The task has timed out\",\"status\":500,\"statusText\":\"Internal Server Error\"}\n\nWhen it happens, it appears to happen over and over again with the same game for hours.  That game just keeps getting re-added to the simulation queue and the simulation keeps getting re-run.

In addition to the steps [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment#the-do-it-yourself-way) I had to `npm update nodemon`.\n\nNow I'm having trouble with the database dump. I cloned the repo again and downloaded the dump this morning, but after `mongorestore --drop dump/` there are still missing schema errors. Do you know if I've missed anything out?\n @dariusf Hello, your problem has been solved yet, I also encountered the same problem!\n  Using the librarian as my hero I tried to call `opponentsHero.hasEffect('slow')` to check if it was currently slowed but this doesn't appear to be an available method on the enemy hero ('brawler' in this case). It should be added to enable avoiding double-slowing (I don't believe it stacks?).\n I think it's turning out to try to call `hasEffect` on the enemy commander, which doesn't have that API. Hmm. Let me think about this a bit, whether the commander should be affected by spells. Probably not shrink, since then it would be really easy to kill the base...\n I'm not sure if we're talking about different things\u2014I was referring to the enemy hero (fangrider, brawler, etc.) and not the enemy commander (base).\n\nHere's example code for the librarian's chooseAction:\n\n```\n$this = this;\nvar enemyHero = $this.getByType('fangrider')[0];\nif (!enemyHero) {\n    $this.say('No hero');\n    return;\n}\n\nthis.say(enemyHero.type + 'has effect: ' + enemyHero.hasEffect('slow'));\n```\n\nIf I run this against an opponent using fangrider as a hero then I get the error:\n\n> Line 8, time 0.1: Calling hasEffect is not allowed.\n\nI think that clearly an opponent's heroes should be affected by spells like slow, so it seems like this should be legal. \n\nWhether or not an opponent's commander (base) should be affected does indeed an interesting question, but it's not what I originally filed the issue about.\n Looks like it's fixed. Thanks!\n  The documentation for commander.attack() states that the commander will move toward its target if the target is out of range. It does qualify it with \"and the commander is smart enough\" but it still seems like people might get confused. \n  It would be nice to show the programming language name in a tooltip for the icon next to the player's name/score on the leaderboard. It would be pretty hard to pair some of the logos with a language unless you were already familiar with it (Python and Clojure in particular). You can always go back to the main page to pair them up but it's an extra step that could be avoided.\n  [This Line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/User.coffee#L32) clearly isn't working because whatever size I request through getPhotoURL, the URL from that line gets used and the original file is returned, unresized. I checked out `file.coffee` but not sure where this was supposed to happen.\n\nIf pointed in the right direction I could check this out myself.\n Yeah, it was never implemented, just wishful thinking on my part (plus it works if it falls back to Gravatar). TODO\n  Would be awesome if in the multiplayer levels you had the option of opening both human and ogre code at the same time so you could work on both codes at the same time.  \n\nSomething like this:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/3646270/2a85abac-10f2-11e4-8ffa-bb54fccf80d7.png)\n\nWould be nice if the Success/Failure message updated based on which code was currently active.  Or it could just say something like: \"Humans/Ogres win\" or \"Draw\".\n  I get an error dialog when trying to sign the agreement on the [employers page](http://codecombat.com/employers) again.\n\n![empolyersagreementbug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2965172/3632956/baae6084-0ed1-11e4-8a1c-c45899790086.png)\n I did previously sign it.  Either I should not be prompted again, or I should be able to sign again.  I'm currently blocked from drilling into a profile.\n We don't really need this any more.\n  C'mon PR 1337 has got to be celebrated :)\n  I added a couple lines to draw an arc instead of a circle.  This is done by sending two extra arguments with the aoe- json, startAngle and endAngle.\n\nI haven't tested this as I wasn't sure how to test it.\n I tried it out, but it doesn't quite work. I added some other code in 7b39bd0, but I don't think it's quite right, either. I think one would want to add a component that actually tries to draw these arcs in order to test it.\n\nThe dev setup isn't that bad, really! :)\n combat.Cleaves actually does draw the arcs now (supposedly)\n\nMaybe I'll try the dev environment after I've gotten some school work done.  :)\n Does it show the proper cleave angles if you have less than a full circle, or the angles wrong?\n The angles seem to be off sometimes, they are the correct size, but sometimes aimed the wrong direction.\n\nIs it possible to have that arc show on selection instead of the whole circle?\n Might be something to do with the coordinate system being different and having to convert from geometric (y is up) to graphics (y is down). If you can figure out the conversion, it will be good.\n\nWe could adjust the [buildRadius](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/Mark.coffee#L137-L137) method to look to see if there was a `@sprite.thang[range.replace 'Range', 'Angle']` and, if so, draw just the arc. But how do we know which direction to point it? Or is `cleaveAngle` the direction and something else the arc length?\n cleaveAngle is the portion of the circle that gets drawn.  It is centered on the direction the thang is facing, so `@rotation`\n\nBasically would want an arc between `@rotation - @cleaveAngle/2` and `@rotation + @cleaveAngle/2` with a radius of `@cleaveRadius`.\n @nemoyatpeace I forget: are we still seeing any drawing issues with the current cleave code?\n Yes, there are still issues.  I believe that it is drawing the `y` upside down.\n\nAlso, something just changed, because my test case now moves instead of cleaving when given a location.\n  I have a question: what's the difference between the production and the master branches?\n Ok, thank you a lot for your answer. And yes, next time I will post on the Discourse.\n  Code in hero's chooseAction in Dungeon Area:\n\n```\nfun = -> \n    for x in [1, 2, 3]\n        for y in [1, 2, 3]\n            null\n```\n\nFails with:\n\n> Missing `this.` keyword; should be `this.accum$1`.\n> There is no function `accum$1`, but `this` has a method `accum$1`.\n Thanks @lawrencejohnston, for this and the other CoffeeScript bug reports. I'll see what I can do!\n Any luck fixing this and the other CoffeeScript errors I reported (#1310 and #1291)? This sort of error makes it frustrating for me to develop in CoffeeScript as every time I get an error I have to try to determine if it's actually a bug in my code or a bug in the transpiler (and #1310 makes that process even more difficult) so I end up going back to JS. I imagine it would be even more frustrating for somebody not familiar with programming and debugging code, so it seems like fixing this sort of issue should be a part of the push to get people using other languages.\n Great; thanks for looking into them.\n\nOn Aug 27, 2014, at 8:07 AM, Nick Winter notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I'm on a bug-fixing spree for the next couple days; I hope to get to these ones.

It should be remembering your language based on that, but perhaps it is not working.\n\nWhat browser do you use, and does it log you out of other sites besides CodeCombat when you close the browser? I wonder if there's some cookie setting that's making it not remember your cookie.\n The language part of my issue doesn't have anything to do with the account (it only happens when I'm not logged in).\nMy browser is Google Chrome, and no, it doesn't log me out from other sites besides CodeCombat (I noticed that you don't have a \"keep me connected\" box).\n Yes, this is still happening. I will try to explain better:\n1. If I login, using the username and password method, every time I close the browser (without login out), my account gets logged out.\n2. Without being logged in, if  I change the language to the one I want, every time I close and open the browser, the language is changed (this has nothing to do with the language tied to my account, because that remains untouched).\n3. I didn't try Firefox, because I don't have it installed.\n My configuration is equal to yours. Maybe it is something related to my account or computer. I will try to create a new one.\n\nUpdate: I created a new account and it keeps getting logged out.\n Yes! Every time I close the browser, I am logged out (if I only close the CodeCombat tab and keep another one open, and then open CC again, i'm still logged in).\n I tried in IE11 and it logged me of too. I can\u00b4t try FF right now, but maybe other day.\n Maybe it is because you are logged in as an Admin. What if you try to log in with a non-Admin account?\n @Imperadeiro98 I tried this on Chromium Web Browser on Ubuntu 14.04 but was unable to reproduce this problem.\n @Imperadeiro98 Still seeing it? Your computers' system times are set correctly, right?\n I guess it's my Mac Chrome that doesn't think that closing the browser is the end of the browsing session, and other browsers think that it does. Our cookies are set to expire at end of browsing session. I tried messing around with `expires` and `maxAge` options in [our cookie session middleware](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/server_setup.coffee#L75), but no effect.\n  When I'm working with the level editor and trying to copy between two different levels I sometimes put the screens side by side.  I like how I can hide the script list in this form:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/3533930/89fc8150-07dd-11e4-87e3-7246c311e722.png)\n\nBut when I maximize the window again, the scripts are still hidden with nothing to make them appear again:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/3533935/9f042dfa-07dd-11e4-8745-8c9e3256fd64.png)\n\nWould be nice if the scripts unhide upon maximize, or at least if the show button was still there.\n\nI just realized that the tabs at the top of the editor are also gone upon maximizing again, so I can't switch back to other parts of the editor.\n There is also no play button when the screen is in the smaller version.\n  Need to be able to make the Guide accept different programming languages.\n Spoken or programming languages? We have the former, and it doesn't seem practical to try to translate the guide for each programming-language/spoken-language combo for each level, or we'd need a really good solution.\n\nWe could do this for general articles, though. Like have an article for JavaScript loops in English, an article for JavaScript loops in German, an article for Python loops in English, etc. Will need some more infrastructure to relate them to each other, though.\n Added at Nick's request...  would there be a way to add a snippet of code into the guide, so which snippet is added depends on the language?\n\nCurrently I have this for my guides:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6550021/3533349/9c7f532e-07cf-11e4-901b-6448625cdaa4.png)\n\nI'd like to be able to say `self.attackRange` or `this.attackRange` based on language.\n You can now do this by adding several languages' blocks, since the guides and intros now filter out the not-chosen language:\n\n``````\nSome guide text in the guide! Code like this!\n\n```python\nself.example()\n```\n```javascript\nthis.example();\n```\n```clojure\n(.example this)\n```\n\nYay **Markdown**!\n``````\n\nIt will only show the one for the user's target language.\n  This code should be permitted in a spell:\n\n```\ninner();\n\nfunction inner() {\n\n}\n```\n\nbut it fails with the error `Missing `this.` keyword; should be `this.inner`.`\n\n[Here's](http://jsfiddle.net/6djKA/1/) a jsfiddle showing that this is legal JavaScript.\n  This patch fetches a referenced model and registers it with the supermodel if no cached version is available. This should fix some 'Unknowns' throughout editors. There is one unintended bug so far though: Some error pops up. Some `null`s inside `Treema.integrateChildTreemas`. I'll leave this hanging around until I've gathered enough courage to come back to it.\n  I'm working with the headless simulator with an eye toward simulating games locally without communication with any CodeCombat server (even one running locally).\n\nLooking at the code it seemed like the \"testing\" mode was a good place to start from because it allows you to run a simulation from the test.js file in the source.\n\nWhile I was able to get the headless simulator up and running when I run it against the test.js file in source control the simulation doesn't seem to function properly. No matter what code I put in for the two teams neither team ever wins. [Here's a Gist](https://gist.github.com/lawrencejohnston/df1b345ad9674bfd0524) of the output I get.\n\nWhen I replace the test.js file with a response from /queue/scoring on the live site the simulation seems to function as expected, logging messages about creating bases and heroes, etc. and calculating a winner.\n May be need to [dump in the database](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Developer-environment#setup) first? Not sure those missing schemas will affect the results or not..\n\n```\nMissing schema for channel 'level-set-volume'.\nMissing schema for channel 'me:synced'.\nMissing schema for channel 'tome:cast-spells'.\nMissing schema for channel 'tome:spell-debug-value-request'.\nMissing schema for channel 'god:new-world-created'.\n```\n @kumabotz Hi Tery, thanks for helping me work this one out.\n\nI was unsure whether or not these missing schema messages were to be expected when running a headless simulation. From what you're saying it sounds like they're not?\n\nI already ran the database import when getting my clone setup using a database dump from July 4th.\n\nJust to be sure I re-ran the database import. [Here's](https://gist.github.com/lawrencejohnston/46ff09ea75e741e493f9) the output.\n\nI still get the messages about the missing schemas even after the re-import (nothing seems to have changed).\n\nDo you have any other ideas about what could be causing these issues?\n It looks like a21d17a168ecfc3e83e40d145cc9ccdbc1bb10fe by @schmatz could be relevant. In it a switch was made from `session.code` to `session.transpiledCode`.\n Hi Michael, \n\nThanks for the explanation, that makes sense. Either of those options sounds like it would work for my purposes. I think transpiling the code before feeding it to the simulator would make the most sense. \n\nI haven't looked into doing transpilation yet, so any advice you could give me on where to start would be appreciated and would save me some time and effort. Are there any dependencies of the transpilation that I'm likely to have issues with trying to run it outside of the full server environment, or is it relatively self-contained?\n You can check out how we transpile the code from a script here: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/scripts/transpile.coffee#L19-L48\n\nHowever, it seems like you should be able to just replace test.js with the latest /queue/scoring response you captured, since that one contains the transpiled code. That's how test.js was originally made; there's nothing special about it.\n @nwinter Hi Nick, \nThanks, that was exactly what I needed. I couldn't just use a download from /queue/scoring because I wanted to be able to transpile raw code and simulate that.\n\nI think all my questions about the code are resolved. I'll leave this issue open until the test.js file is updated.\n  I got a patch ready that fetches LatestReferenceVersion models on demand as part of the Treema extension. It effectively fixed 'Unknown' references in the level editor, except for the `treema-shortened` preview when a node is collapsed. Though I'm sure I'll get that one to work too.\n\nThe patches however still don't show properly. The Treema doesn't have children Treemas, as can be seen in this image:\n\n![](http://puu.sh/9XLtd/bb864c32c1.png)\n\nI looked around how others did it but couldn't find the difference. I'm sure Scott could help me out really quickly?\n\nHere's a working node for reference, with the shortened version still as 'Unknown'.\n\n![](http://puu.sh/9XLFK/e3aaceb95a.png)\n Oh, it's because the root node is always hidden. It's assumed to be a collection (an array or object) and that's why we don't usually show treemas in the patches for anything but collections. Think of all the treemas throughout the site, all of them have top-level collection nodes which are kept out of sight but always open.\n\nA quick fix would be to nest the value in an array (and alter the schema to match). A better fix would be to make it so Treemas can have an option to show the top value or not.\n I think its worth figuring out how to show the top level value. I'll look at Treema tomorrow. Any pointers in the right direction? \n I would add an option to treema which would add a class to the root node that triggers a rule to override the `&.treema-root > .treema-row .treema-value, &.treema-root > .treema-row .treema-type-select` rule at the top of base.sass\n  Fixed providing the correct snippets depending on the programming language. \n I couldn't find any bugs. It actually only resolves bugs :)\n  I've tried several methods of getting a dev-environment setup and until just now I failed miserably. Yes I am definitley new to this but setting up the dev-environment shouldn't stop anyone from making a contribution. I finally got the Linux-installer to work. I installed it on Lubuntu just because I had it laying around and it belongs to the Ubuntu family. \n\nFix: During the installation of npm I had several errors. I researched a bit and found out that the packets \"make\" and \"build-essential\" have to be installed so that npm install can work its magic. Could you please add that to the wiki. Maybe a plain Ubuntu has these already preinstalled.\n\nIn codecombat/scripts/devSetup/configuration.py there is a line that states your private repository url. Does this have to be changed by the user prior to running setup.py?\n\nWindows and vagrant install also failed on me. I'm sure it's some kind of configuration issue. II'll have another look at it and will report my findings. \n Another possibility is having the dev box ready using https://www.nitrous.io/\n Sorry for not responding, was on a festival last week. Both solutions seem pretty easy to get started. At the moment I would prefer the Docker solution. This would make it very easy. The Installer scripts for Win and Linux are also great but it's pretty hard to keep them up to date and watch out for new versions/dependencies. I reckon most of my frustation came down to the slow internet connection I am currently bound to. Tons of little tools/package but especially MongoDB and the backup are pretty large downloads. Now everything seems to be up and running.\n I'm building a docker env for codecombat.\nIt's the beginning...\nSource files : https://github.com/smoratinos/docker-codecombat\n Thank you @smoratinos, I've started reading a bit about setting up a docker container but was just starting to dabble with it. I love how this is working out. Someone has a problem and someone else pitches in to find a solution for everybody. Would this DockerFile run in combination with vagrant or standalone? \n I don't use Vagrant, but I think you can use the docker image (build with the DockerFile) with vagrant or standalone.\n\nI build a \"base\" image, now I must create a \"db\" image (extend base and add mongodb) and a \"web-server\" image (extend base and add node.js).\n\nIt's a Work In Progress...\n @djsmith85 Have you completed the codecombat erection?, I encountered a problem and help me solve it?\n @jequal What kind of problem did you encounter? I'll gladly help if I can.\n @djsmith85 You can enter hipchat help me solve the problem?\nhttp://www.hipchat.com/guvjJLzfz\n I believe emhs added it to the build script a few days ago for Ubuntu (make\nis included with build-essential)\nOn Thu, Jan 15, 2015 at 1:11 PM Nick Winter notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Anyone want to add make and build-essentials to the dev setup script (or\n> has it been already), and/or add a Docker or Vagrant-based method?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/1241#issuecomment-70132456\n> .\n  If we show the delay in the button, then it might make it a bit more obvious about the autocast. It could either say, like \"5s\", or it could count down, or it could have a tiny progress bar... worth trying something like this perhaps.\n  I get this 100% of the time I try to login with G+. The error is\n\n```\nCallback function named \"signinCallback\" not found \n```\n\nIt looks like this started happening when this commit refactored some code https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/2e40a536740b811d69a346d54a96bc80088e73b3#diff-f007d2d808ff0ac067e7814a8a5baed4R5\n\nWhen the G+ code was moved into a 'require' the callback [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/Router.coffee#L78) can no longer find it.\n\nA quick fix would just be extracting the G+ from google.coffee and putting it back into main.html. Or we can just find the `signinCallback` function.\n  Since actions are so important in CodeCombat, it would be good to add extra statement highlighting for the statement that set the action that the Thang is currently doing.\n  We\u2019ve changed coordinate hover to {x: 35, y: 20}, but it\u2019s a little too horizontal now, so it has become unclear where the point is. We should play around with adding a point marker of some sort.\n\nOver in [app/lib/surface/CoordinateDisplay.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CoordinateDisplay.coffee#L24-L30), in `build`, we should build another [EaselJS sprite](http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Sprite.html) child with a couple [Shapes](http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Shape.html) to implement a nice pointer of some sort. Then we just need to position it properly and hide/show it with the label and background. Should be a nice easy one to do some simple HTML5 canvas graphics.\n Hi there. I haven't worked on codecombat source before (or any OSS for that matter), so I thought I'd start with this issue. I spent some time figuring out the coco source and EaselJS without making much progress on the actual problem, but I think I got the hang of it now. Maybe I'll have something working in a few days. I included a picture of what I had in mind for the point marker. Let me know if this is okay, or if you have something else in mind. Thanks.\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2177020/3519842/b7757c3a-0720-11e4-8e5b-5423d7179265.JPG)\n That looks pretty good. I had been imagining something where the `{x: 0, y: 0}` were centered above the point (instead of above-and-to-the-right), but perhaps this will be better, since it'll offer a more cursor-like experience.\n You like my MS Paint skills? I'll start with the marker off-center, and I can change it if you decide you want it in the middle with the coordinates centered above.\n\nIt should look similar to this (better Photoshop version):\n\n![codecombatcoordinatecrosshair2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2177020/3534605/8c954c38-07ee-11e4-953d-ee9146f99bde.png)\n\nI thought it would be good in the future to implement something to keep the coordinate display (including point marker) completely in view when the marker is near the edges of the view. Right now it gets cut off when near the edges. Should this be a separate issue?\n Ah, good idea. It can be its own issue if you don't want to work on it at the same time as this one.\n If I can get as far as getting the marker to work, I'll probably continue and try to do that as well.\n\nI have more n00b questions for you when you get a chance.\n1. I was writing some helper methods while figuring out what the code in the CoordinateDisplay class does. Is it okay to define methods using `name = ->` instead of `name: ->` if they are not intended to be part of the prototype? I thought I should ask since I noticed a lot of the code doesn't seem to use the former style, and I know non-prototype methods can cause memory issues.\n2. I noticed the background of the coordinate display is cut off on the bottom and right sides, and the label isn't centered. I fixed this, but I'm not sure if I should submit a pull request. Can I freely submit pull requests, or is there a guideline for when/how?\n We should probably stick with `name: ->` for OOP consistency rather than defining helper methods outside of the classes themselves\u2013unless you can think of a good reason to use `name = ->`?\n\nYou can submit pull requests whenever, sure!\n You're right, we should keep it consistent. The only reason I thought to use `name = ->` is to mark the helpers inaccessible outside of the class, but that style of function has some idiosyncrasies that may cause confusion.\n\nI submitted my pull request! First one ever!\n Congrats on your first pull request! May it be but the first of many.\n Thank you!\n\nI've been working a bit on the point marker. Is it required that I use an EaselJS `Sprite`? I was looking at the docs for the `Sprite` and it looks like its used with image files. Since the point marker I made is so simple and isn't animated, is it alright if I draw it using a `Shape`?\n\nThe `updateSize` method was getting big, so I refactored it a bit. I'm not sure if what I did is good. Would you mind taking a look to make sure I'm not making a mess?\n\nYou can see my changes here:\nhttps://github.com/TheSecretSquad/codecombat/blob/89cb0ee73d18324ad5071257a9ed08780ffd38ae/app/lib/surface/CoordinateDisplay.coffee\n\nHere's a screenshot of what the point marker looks like:\n![screenshot from 2014-07-13 14 00 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2177020/3565382/f09b619c-0ab7-11e4-9603-9d69aa8058d2.jpg)\n Yup, this all looks good. Want to submit another PR?\n Cool, thanks. I was going to submit a PR, but the coordinates are completely hidden when you move to the top or right edges of the surface. If that's okay (for now) then I'll submit, otherwise I could hold off until I figure out a way to fix it near the edges.\n It's okay for now. Ideally the layout adjusts to point from the center toward the point, so it can have one of four orientations, but that's a separate improvement.\n I submitted the pull request.\n\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean about \"layout adjusts to point from the center toward the point\".\n\nHere is how I'm thinking about it:\nShifting the shapes around using `shape.regX` and `shape.regY` should allow us to move the display around the mouse pointer. However, using `regX/Y` requires that we change the container cache starting positions. We can make the container cache size accommodate all four orientations by scaling the total height and width returned from `updateSize`, and shifting the cache start points so it centers around all four point marker orientations.\n\n![codecombatcoordinatecrosshairadjustable](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2177020/3566258/07094162-0aed-11e4-8d78-9ecaee4f3030.png)\n\nIs this anything close to what you're saying?\n Those for layouts are what I meant, yeah. As far as the caching, that could work, but I think we would just uncache and recache the container whenever we changed its orientation, so we wouldn't cache a container larger than needed.\n I see. I was just taking a shot in the dark. You would know better than me. I'm still building a mental model of drawing with EaselJS. I'll keep playing with it, but I can't guarantee a solution anytime soon. I have trouble finding the correct cache position/dimensions with only one orientation. :grin:\n  These widgets consume a lot of network requests on every page load. If you, for example, jump straight to playing a level (or reload the page while playing one), you don't need this stuff. You do eventually need it, like if you go back to another page that should show the social widgets, or if you beat a level and need to be able to facetweet us, so we can't just ignore them depending on starting page URL\u2013we need to be able to lazily load them. And they each have different situations, so they need to have their own rules for when they're needed.\n  It seems like something with the refactorings busted this in the past couple weeks?\n\n![screenshot 2014-06-23 08 25 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3359659/c4c97a18-faea-11e3-9c72-1648b2dd2e93.png)\n  In the past week or so i noticed that the longer you use the Level Editor the slower it gets , reaching the point where it freezes up.

Could you check again, maybe the problem was solved.\n  I can't reproduce. Is it still broken?\n  How about issuing a badge for each completed level which can be sent to a player's Mozilla OpenBadges backpack? You already have awesome images for each level which would do well as a badge image.\n\nsee http://www.openbadges.org/\n Great to read your idea! You might be pleased to hear that I'm the one currently working on an Achievement system, which would probably best fit your description once finished. We've already thought of 'bringing CodeCombat out in the open' and this sounds like a perfect opportunity to do so. Achievements already have artwork for them and anything! Bringing them out in the open sounds wonderfully fulfilling.\n\n@bkimminich do you have any experience with the badges (either issuer or earner) and if so, would you have any other advice that we should take into account when setting up such a badge system?\n\nI've checked out my own OpenBadges backpack, checked out an article about them, the BadgeKit API and also BadgeKit itself. It's the latter one I'm rather confused about and since there's no online version available anymore I didn't have time to check it out as thoroughly. _TODO_ for myself: make sure I understand what metadata needs to be embedded in images and check out how I'll be automatically generating badges when creating achievements.\n\nThis system won't be something I'll be tackling immediately, since GitHub integration has some priority over it, but it _is_ something I definitely see as a must-have for CodeCombat that could only add to its glory.\n Sorry, I am only collecting badges like crazy - I have no experience with the API behind it. When you are done with the achievements and they are visible in a public profile, you should definetely contact http://coderbits.com and let them integrate CodeCombat, for example with a multi-player bit similar to what they're doing with FightCodeGame. Cheers!\n Thanks for the feedback, I checked out Coderbits and it looks pretty cool. I guess you were targeting their badges then? Since they only seem to allow 5 different grades of a same achievement, we could quantify our achievements (X achievements gotten) or something. But it doesn't look like they allow a backpack of different badges. Either way, cool stuff! Thanks for that.\n  GIF that illustrates the bug is here:http://gfycat.com/BleakDetailedHedgehog\nPeon's behavior described here: http://pastebin.com/uH988Gt4\n Could you paste the entirety of your code, so we can reproduce?\n  This PR adds another check for 64-bit systems which fail to pass the `is64Bit = sys.maxsize/3 > 2**32` test.\nPython sometimes defaults to using i386 on x86_64 systems causing it to use 32-bit python and shoots out this error:\n\n```\nsudo python ./coco/scripts/devSetup/setup.py\n...\nerrors.NotSupportedError:\nu\"Your processor is determined to have a maxSize of2147483647,\\n\nwhich doesn't correspond with a 64-bit architecture.\\n\nPlease contact CodeCombat support, and include this error in your message.\"\n```\n\nWe can fix this by checking if the machine is x86_64 with `os.uname`. If it is we can safely assume the system is 64 bit and thus return 64.\nI have only experienced this problem when trying to build on a macbook air with brew installed python. \n  Just updated to Firefox 30.0, but codecombat.com stooped working, I get blank grey screen. I get the following error messages:\n\n```\nTypeError: mutating the [[Prototype]] of an object will cause your code to run very slowly; instead create the object with the correct initial [[Prototype]] value using Object.create vendor.js:3777\nSecurityError: The operation is insecure. vendor.js:6489\nTypeError: Backbone.Mediator is undefined app.js:44\nBlocked loading mixed active content \"http://platform.linkedin.com/in.js\"[Learn More] codecombat.com\nTypeError: Backbone.Mediator is undefined codecombat.com:95\nTypeError: Backbone.Mediator is undefined codecombat.com:146\n```\n  Calling `this.getNearestEnemy().distance(something)` throws a \"Calling distance is not allowed\" error, which is pretty silly when you consider I can still do `something.distance(this.getNearestEnemy())`.\n I'm pretty sure this is intentional, and that you're not allowed to call methods of any sort on enemy units. Why not just use `something.distance(this.getNearestEnemy())`?\n Which level is it? I can allow the `distance` method in certain enemies' APIs (since it's not destructive), so perhaps some level(s) just need that set up.\n This seems to already be fixed in Dungeon Arena (I think I encountered this issue a week or two ago, but I can't reproduce it now).\n Actually my last comment was incorrect. I just reproduced it again in Dungeon Arena, calling `.distance()` on the enemy hero passing my base as the argument:\n\n> Line 107, time 0.2: Calling distance is not allowed.\n Right, I've found the issue now. It's going to take some doing, though, so it may take me a while to fix.\n Did you make any changes recently in an attempt to fix this? It looks maybe a new bug was introduced: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/1309.\n Added at the request of @nwinter:\n\nIf I have a property in the hasAPI component, and only list it in the bottom, separate section, like this: \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/3573494/b7731002-0b72-11e4-9733-8927484209ee.png)\nThen it plays nicely with the apiUserProperties section of programming.Programmable and will be user-writable.\n\nIf instead I list it like this (both in the apiProperties section and the lower section as well): \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/3573523/0e9dea1e-0b73-11e4-9b56-89a8ac6a7329.png)\nThen it doesn't play nicely with apiUserProperties in programming.Programmable and will be read-only.\n That's what `git commit --amend` is for :P\n [![Salt-N-Pepa - Push It](http://img.youtube.com/vi/vCadcBR95oU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCadcBR95oU)\n\nIf you realize your mistake quick enough that nobody's pulled it it's safe to `git push -f`\n  I'm trying to refine my Humans Gold Rush code against my own Ogres code (since it's currently ranked #6), and at the end of the simulation (when Ogres win), the \"You Win!\" screen popped up. At first, I thought this was because, as I wrote the Ogres code, \"I\" did actually win.\n\nHowever, I also see it when watching replays of games against other users where I lost, so I'm not sure what's happening.\n @sderickson Didn't we figure out a fix for this in Criss-Cross? Do we need to do it to other levels, or does it apply automatically, or perhaps it's a different issue?\n  From [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/request-ability-to-control-tab-width/835):\n\n```\nSome of us like 3 spaces per tab instead of 4.\nIt would great to be able to customize this in the editor settings.\n```\n\nYeah, that's probably a good configuration option.\n We also need to make sure that when pasting code in from other sources, tabs are converted to spaces automatically: http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/consistent-code-needs-to-line-up/1846\n  And Traduct line 39\n Thanks @ChrisLightman!\n    Using Chrome on Windows 7.  All image layer items disappear on zooming out.  Landscape layer disappears if zoomed out all the way.  Only shadows remain!\n\nI verified that I'm using the current version of Chrome, I tried clearing cache and cookies, and I tried restarting Chrome.  Problem persists.\n\nNo problems in Firefox, everything loaded beautifully.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7752453/3138344/3a73bf16-e886-11e3-8da4-ecfe07b94b62.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7752453/3138347/52ecbc3c-e886-11e3-9833-906f689f9be0.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7752453/3138350/7d14743c-e886-11e3-8943-a7b97fa95d06.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7752453/3138352/996a4ea4-e886-11e3-9aec-fcb12429bd40.png)\n Seems fixed, the sprites are showing up as expected.  Sometimes it just takes a different technology, eh?\n  The SuperModel tries to prevent too many duplicates by doing lookups in loadModel and passing back the cached model if there is one. But this doesn't work in a couple scenarios:\n\n1) The same model is loaded from a different URL.\n2) The same model is loaded twice, but with different projected data.\n3) The model is loaded from a collection.\n\nAn example of this being a problem is in the Level Editor. It loads all components that the level needs, but it also loads a collection of all components. There's clearly an overlap, so there become two models in the same system. Sometimes duplicates show up in the save version modal because of this. And this opens the system to bugs where something makes changes to one instance of the model but then tries to save another instance.\n\nOne solution: have the SuperModel only ever let there be one registered instance for each collection-id pairing, and spit out warnings or silently fix when there are conflicts. If two models load the same thing, log a warning that suggests coming up with a better strategy for loading resources so that duplicates don't happen. If a collection loads a model we already have, extend the registered model with the new model's data and replace the collection's model with the registered one (it already sort of does this, but by URL rather than collection-id pairing).\n\nThis doesn't completely solve there ever being duplicate model instances pointing to the same document, but it will at least let developers know when this is happening.\n Example case where this was an issue. The new documentation view was added to the level editor and the supermodel was passed in. This caused projected data of one collection to overwrite complete data from another collection. See d5a8d8d.\n  I think this is by design and just because we don't treat it as a new say() when the numeric value at the end slightly changes.\n  @nwinter Could you add more details/screenshots here as you run across them?\n  I was able to see the patches right after I submitted them, but now I can't.\n  See also: #1087 \n  Just as an FYI I can't see it at all. Not even a pixel.\n This was fixed in an earlier PR. So can be closed :)\n  Update some phrases.\n  - fixed single stepping for frames\n How about Cmd/Ctrl . and ,? \nThat would be easy to recognize andI don't think it's taken.\n  This fixes our Travis CI build and tidies the camera.spec.coffee a little\n  I tried to write the following Python code (the editor is in Python mode):\n\n```\ntry:\n    self.count += 1\nexcept:\n    self.count = 0\n\nself.say(self.count)\n```\n\nI get an \"unexpected token\" error on the first line.\nIs this language feature implemented?\n Yeah currently the python implementation is missing that. A major problem with getting try accept working is that we'd need to replicate all of the python exception types if we wanted you to be able to use them. \n\nThe project that it uses is https://github.com/differentmatt/filbert so go chuck an issue up there and someone should get to it eventually. It was made by differentmatt and I've just help a little recently so it's not the fastest moving project.\n thank you for the note, implementing missing features will probably be a  lot of work. I guess I now have a reason to learn javascript :)\n  Example: Trying to add points to ai.PatrolsAndAttacks \n\nStep 1: Click the plus to add a Point\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/3070869/06713874-e2af-11e3-9aa7-5afee9d631cb.png)\n\nStep 2: Cursor is in edit box\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/3070923/e3402224-e2af-11e3-8e9a-be26067bc926.png)\n\nStep 3a: If you type, tab, type, hit enter/return, everything is fine.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/3070901/8a4a0176-e2af-11e3-938d-ece9bd45e928.png)\n\nStep 3b: If you click anywhere outside of the edit box, the page becomes uneditable, even if you try to click back into the edit box.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/3070916/cacc5168-e2af-11e3-882e-624d06427950.png)\n\nNote the lack of a blue outline on the box.\n\nIf you click on another tab or component and come back, it's as if you never tried to create a new point.\n  The line no. 123 disappeared. I may have accidentally deleted it while working on 122. Sorry. Please correct.\n  It uses the game selection state, but that's optimized for selecting units. We used to have the whole selected thang glow blue when selected, which was great but super not performant. The main problem we have now is that you can't see when you've selected a wall if there are walls all around it. So we need something that\n\na) is performant\nb) is visible, and\nc) looks real good\n A blue glow would definitely look a lot better than what we have now. A couple of questions -\n1. How was it implemented?\n2. What exactly were the performance issues?\n Okay, I'll try to think of a different way.\nAny suggestions?\n You could create a rectangular or circular dotted line shape and place it on the floating layer. It could be keyed off the same setting that the shadow shape is based on and use the image object's bounds to determine dimensions.\n\nMight also mess with EaselJS's [Shadow class](http://createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Shadow.html). See if that can be performant.\n  We received a report detailing this bug.\n\n\"We only ran into one bug, one you probably know about already - at level 4 the S and P keys would suddenly not work. Copying/pasting those letters still worked. This was only for some students, unsure of which browsers, using PC's. \"\n\nI couldn't replicate, but I remember hearing about this bug before.\n I can verify that this sporadically happens. Not exactly sure how/why. It doesn't seem to be reproducible. :(\n More likely related to https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/core/application.coffee#L16-L23\n  Which level? See: http://codecombat.com/editor/level/dungeon-arena-tutorial Each of the buttons show some here. I guess some levels don't have anything for a given category.\n I haven't looked at the Current Thangs UI code directly but same issues play out in how things are categorised in the ThangType picker on the right of the screen. One issue I've found is some units were originally categorised as Misc (it's the default) and the item coming back from search (despite the call to uniq in client code there appears to be just one version coming back) is always the first version so Kind (how category is set on ThangType) is not the latest one set in the Thang editor. But I have seen variations between levels in whether some of ogres appear in Misc or Units. I should make clear it's unlikely I'll be contributing fix for this soon: just commenting to help others.\n  Just a few words and phares until have more experience in the project.\n @nwinter Signed! :) Please let me know any development or translation that I can help with.\n @nwinter I translated just two phrases there, can you verify? If I succeded I can translate more :)\n @nwinter Nice! Do you have any communication place to talk things like that or talk about the code? IRC, for example?\n  Add back in current user to nearby simulators\n\nI think this was left commented out by mistake.\n I'll take a proper look in a bit. I presumed that bit of the commit comment was handled elsewhere in the commit. I'll modify it to not show the lower section at all if the user is in the top 5 simulators.\ncc @schmatz \n I haven't been able to reproduce an issue of the current user showing up in both the top and bottom sections. This shouldn't be occuring because we have in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play/ladder/simulate_tab.jade:\n`var showJustTop = simulatorsLeaderboardData.inTopSimulators() || me.get('anonymous');` and we only show bottom if this evaluates to false. The definition of inTopSimulators is here:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/ladder/simulate_tab.coffee#L126\n\nWas there another issue that including the current user in the bottom table was causing?\n  How can I use Clojure in Greed? \n\nI changed the current editor to Clojure but how do I access \"this\"? The \"this-as\" macro doesn't parse and I can't define it myself.\n\nCould you translate me the following js code snippet to Clojure as an example?\n\n```\nif (base.built.length === 0)\n    base.build('peasant');\n```\n You can use `this` like any other object (like in the @nwinter's comment), just be aware of [JavaScript's issues with `this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this). The Clojure implementation is currently subject to the same issues.\n By the way, comprehensive examples of available features / functions can be found in the [tests](https://github.com/vickychijwani/closer.js/tree/master/spec). closer-spec tests the language features, closer-core-spec tests the core library, functional-spec tests other miscellaneous stuff (like interop features).\n ```\n(def coins (.getItems base))\n(def gcoins\n    (filter (fn [x] (= 1 1)) coins))\n```\n\nI think there is a bug with filter. \n\ngcoins is always null but it should be the same as coins.\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n```\n(def tlist '(1 2 3 4))\n(def tlistFiltered\n    (filter (fn [x] (> x 2)) tlist) )\n```\n\nI checked my code with http://himera.herokuapp.com/index.html\n `filter` works fine on Find the Spy:\n\n``` clojure\n(let [enemies (filter #(= (.team %) \"ogres\") (.getCombatants this))\n      ;; target the nearest enemy\n      sorted (sort-by #(.distanceTo this %) enemies)\n      target (first sorted)]\n  (when target\n    (.setTarget this target)\n    (.setAction this\n      (if (> (.attackRange this) (.distanceTo this target))\n          \"attack\" \"move\"))))\n```\n\nHaven't tried it on Greed, but it should work.\n I think the error you're facing is _not_ `gcoins` being `null`, but the output of `(.getNearest peasant gcoins)` being `null`. I can reproduce it on my end. This is because `filter` returns a Clojure sequence, and `peasant.getNearest()` in the Greed level works with an array. This works for me on Greed:\n\n``` clojure\n(def coins (.getItems base))\n(def gcoins (to-array (filter (fn [x] (= 1 1)) coins)))    ;; you can also use #(= % %) in place of (fn ...)\n(def nearest (.getNearest p gcoins))  ;; this shouldn't be null now\n```\n\nLet me know if you face any other issues. Meanwhile I'll try to think of a way to make CodeCombat's functions with Clojure sequences somehow.\n Thanks, okay that was the problem. I tried \"into\" before which didn't work \n`(def gcoins (into [] (filter (fn [x] (= 1 1)) coins)))`\n\nThanks again\n `[]` is a standard Clojure vector, so the output of `into` will also be a vector. But `into` won't work on normal JavaScript arrays anyway because they don't support `conj`. I know this is confusing, but it doesn't work in ClojureScript either (I tried `(into (new js/Array) [1 2 3])`). We'll try to make working with all this simpler over time.\n\n@nwinter do you think it makes sense to automatically call `to-array` on Clojure sequences passed to CoCo methods, so `(.getNearest peasant seq)` would transpile to `peasant.getNearest(closerCore.to_array(seq))`? Or should we let the user explicitly perform this operation?\n I feel somewhat sorry but I have another question.\n\nHow do I access Javascript object fields? I tried this\n\n```\n(def coins (.getItems base))\n(def firstcoin (nth coins 0))\n(def o (get firstcoin :bountyGold))\n```\n\nI made sure that firstcoin is not null, but \"o\" is always null.\n Hey, I'm always glad to help, we're all learning one way or the other :). `(.bountyGold firstcoin)` should work. This is how Clojure's standard [Java interop](http://clojure.org/java_interop) works. The rule of thumb is: all CoCo objects are JS objects, so you must interact with them using interop. There's also a few convenience functions for converting between JS and Clojure types: `to-array`, `js->clj` and `clj->js`.\n\n`(get firstcoin :bountyGold)` won't work because `firstcoin` is a JavaScript object, not a Clojure map, and [`get`](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/get) is meant to work with maps. This is something I was considering handling automatically, but I decided against it in favor of the standard interop features. Maybe I should think about it again.\n @MaikKlein you can also try out the [parser demo](http://vickychijwani.github.io/closer.js/) here. If something works there, it will also work on CodeCombat :)\n I started with clojure yesterday so I am pretty new to it too. I would also say that you should convert the types to clojure. As a user I expected , because I was in a clojure enviroment, that all types were types that I could use from clojure without converting them to js-array's.\n\nBut thanks to you, I haven't encountered any problems in the last 3 hours. \n @MaikKlein great to hear you've been learning Clojure via CodeCombat!\n\n@nwinter it would matter in levels like Greed where your code runs less often if it generates more than 4000 statements. Unnecessary calls to `to-array` and friends would increase the likelihood of crossing that threshold (not sure by how much, though; do you have a number?), the irony being that Clojure is meant to help you write concise code. Already calls like `(.moveRight this)` generate too many statements because it's not possible to differentiate between a property access and a zero-argument function call at compile-time, so that decision must be made at runtime (same as Clojure). This is what that simple call transpiles to:\n\n``` js\ntypeof __$this['moveRight'] === 'function' && __$this['moveRight'].length === 0 ? __$this['moveRight']() : __$this['moveRight'];\n```\n\nAnother difficulty is detecting whether a call is to a CodeCombat method or not. There can be many types of MemberExpressions in the AST, like `peasant.getNearest(...)` or `closerCore.map(...)`, or `Array.prototype.slice.call(...)`, or even `(function (a, b) { ... }).call(this, 2, 3);`. Can I detect the first one vs the others, in Aether?\n @vickychijwani I just found this issue again, since I'm gearing up to really launch all the new languages. I forget; did we ever do anything to make the type conversion here more automatic?\n Nope. At the time I had tried a hacky way to do this, but ultimately it hadn't worked out.\n It seems like Aether needs to provide type conversions between non-JavaScript languages and JavaScript, probably via hooks that each language would plug into.\n\nIs the crux of the problem determining when we need to convert from a JavaScript type to a non-JavaScript type?\n @vickychijwani I [added](https://github.com/codecombat/aether/commit/368916f357ecd11af2cc9bb3b83d2397e7648473) a hook for automatically converting types returned from CodeCombat APIs/spells to a code language appropriate type.  \n\nDoes this help Clojure?\n Ok, so there are 2 ways in which Clojure and CoCo can interact:\n1. Getting a JS object from a CoCo API and passing it to a Clojure function => most Clojure functions can handle JS objects, so this is already taken care of.\n2. Getting a Clojure type from a Clojure function and passing it to a CoCo API => this is the case we need to tackle for this issue.\n\nSo the hook doesn't really help with this, as far as I can see. What we would need is another hook to convert Clojure types to JS types before they are passed to CoCo APIs.\n Do Clojure users treat data structures returned from CoCo APIs as JavaScript objects?\n\nI've opened #1451 for a conversion hook into CoCo APIs.\n > Do Clojure users treat data structures returned from CoCo APIs as JavaScript objects?\n\nYes, for now they do. But there is an argument to be made for having Clojure implement the `toNativeTypes()` hook as well, to ensure users have a pure-Clojure environment at all times.\n Had to disable Clojure with the new interpreter for now.\n  Ah, one of these after so long.\n\nBasically, most of the work being done in mousedown handlers is being done in mouseup handlers instead, and @selectAddThang is triggered on mousedown instead of a mouse click.\n\nQuick question about this line - \n\n```\n$('.tab-content').click @selectAddThang\n```\n\nThe selector covers pretty much the entire page, seems to be used only for the add thangs column on the right though. If not, there might be a minor issue with my code.\n\nShould take care of #170 \n Hadn't noticed those bugs. I'll fix them and update the pull request.\nThe esc key is supposed to reset the selected thang, isn't it? It doesn't seem to work though.\nThough obviously, it should be possible to not add thangs even after selecting them by moving the cursor off the viewport/clicking on the background.\n 1 and 2 were happening due to a rather unexpected easeljs issue - the stagemouseup event gets triggered even outside the stage canvas, though stagemousedown works just fine. \nIt's a known issue - I've added a temporary fix by defining the handler directly on the canvas object, I'll revert it once it gets fixed.\n\n3 doesn't seem to happen for me - I can still unselect thangs and not add them by clicking on the background.\n\nI also fixed a couple of other issues in the other two commits.\n A few other commits added for including nanoscrollr in the editor views. Should I create a different pull request for these?\n\nAs for nanoscrollr, a couple of things - \n1. I might've missed a view or two, please let me know if I have.\n2. I seem to encounter unexpected behavior sometimes, a couple of times the scroll bar only moves when I hold my cursor over the bar itself, though the scrolling works normally. Any idea what that might be about?\n Ah, yes missed those two. \nI noticed it in the Components tab too, the only change about that would be a little bit of CSS, and that should really not make a difference. \n  I thought code couldn't be selected; it can but there is no highlight.\n  This worked for me.

I'll do that from now.\n\nThanks for getting the fix in!\n  Related: https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/21\n I think doing it in the game engine is going to be fine for now; it would be hard to automatically, usefully do it in Aether land.\n  It would be nice if when you go to the level editor list of levels you could filter it to only show levels that the current user has created.\n  Suddenly I'm unable to load 2 particular levels (The Right Route and Sword Loop) with my account on codecombat.com. The progress bar goes to 100% and then nothing happens (the page is still responsive though; the progress bar continues animating). This happens on Firefox 28 as well as Chromium 34 (Linux). It's definitely tied to my account somehow because the levels load fine when I logout.\n\nHere are the console logs from when I tried loading Sword Loop in Firefox:\n\n```\n\"Built Grass in 27ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Choppable Tree 4 in 37ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Choppable Tree 1 in 32ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Cow in 191ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Peasant M in 442ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Bluff 1 in 17ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Horse in 273ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Farm in 194ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Bluff 2 in 32ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Well in 13ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Knight in 2384ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Dungeon Floor in 61ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Ogre Brawler in 1008ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Dungeon Wall in 113ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Health Potion Large in 4ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Ogre Munchkin M in 523ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"Built Human Barracks in 3883ms on main thread.\" app.js:1448\n\"|Sekhmet's Cyril|\" \"Worker initialized after 26994ms\" app.js:52\n\"[framesocket] timed out while flushing to persistent storage\" application2.js:6\nError: These should be removed before the transform step aether.js:1817\n\"|Sekhmet's Cheryl|\" \"Worker initialized after 27474ms\" app.js:52\nFirefox can't establish a connection to the server at ws://codecombat.com:9485/. vendor.js:4242\nFirefox can't establish a connection to the server at ws://codecombat.com:9485/. vendor.js:4242\nFirefox can't establish a connection to the server at ws://codecombat.com:9485/. vendor.js:4242\nFirefox can't establish a connection to the server at ws://codecombat.com:9485/.\n```\n Now I can't even login via Google on Firefox. Not even on my local setup. When I click the G+ button, a new window opens, then closes immediately and I don't get logged in (I'm signed in to Google already). Something's definitely messed up. :confused:\n @vickychijwani what is your username?\n I'm not sure what my username is, but the email id tied to my account is vickychijwani [at] gmail.com.\n Hi @vickychijwani, we're looking into the error now :smile:\n Great, thanks!\n  Until now, users could have hardcoded levels that depend on random things happening.\nNow, the rand is seeded with the usercode instead.\n Why not simply add the playerID's hash to the current hash and have everything completely randomized all of the time? \nIf you ever really want to have the same values for everybody everytime, you can roll your own 'rand' component instead (?)\n Ah I get what you mean: say with random coins, you don't want all the coins to change their position for every recompile because users get all confused?\nWould it make sense to have a random seed that stays the same for as long as the user stays in the level? \n  On the level \nhttp://codecombat.com/play/level/mod-squad-supplies-party?skip_protect_api=true\n\nWhen the level succeeds, the page freezes, and an examination of the javascript error console reveals that the level succeeds, but then produces this error:\n\nUncaught RangeError: Invalid typed array length app.js:1163\n\nI don't see this error on other levels with similar goal types.\n ~~It looks like this error only happens in Chrome.  Firefox plays the level with no problems.~~\nNope, finally got it to happen in firefox.  Slightly different error text from firebug:\n\nError: argument 2 must be >= 0\ncase\"string\":return new Uint32Array(a,n,t)\n And, I figured out how to fix it, but this is something should probably be documented a little more clearly, or perhaps worked around on the engine side:\n\nThe problem was that I had deleted the \"offset\" property of a playback.scrub group in the victory script.  The Firebug error message jogged a memory and I went back to compare a working level against this level, and noticed that the \"Offset = 2\" part was missing.  Adding it back in made the error go away.\n\nI'm still not entirely sure what Offset is accomplishing there.\n  I've noticed that whether the prefix \"this\" is included in the \"Available Spells/Properties\" area of the spell tome appears to depend on ~~how many programmable thangs are in the level.  If there is only one selectable/programmable thang, there is no \"this\" prefix.  If there is more than one selectable/programmable thang, then the prefix \"this\" is shown.~~ whether a thang has it's own code or takes it from another thang.  See below.\n\nHowever, this behavior doesn't actually reflect whether the use of \"this\" is required by the level or not.  Should it instead be linked to whether or not the Programmable component has requiresThis set to true?  \n\nEdit: Actually I need to correct that, it's sharing code that actually triggers it.\nCheck out this level:\nhttp://codecombat.com/play/level/mod-squad-supplies-party\nRichard actually owns all of the methods, and the other three simply refer back to Richard's code.  Note that if you select Annie, Lucian or Helga, they all have the \"this\" prefix shown.  Richard, on the other hand, does not.  \n  Example: http://codecombat.com/play/level/count-by-ones\n\nThe simlish audio only triggers occasionally during the intro script and the eventual level playback.  \n\nGeorge commented that he saw this behavior as well in his feedback on the level.\n When I play the level linked above, I get Simlish for some of the script dialogue, but not all of it.  I don't see any particular pattern to it, but I haven't investigated too much.\n    This pull request contains the headless-client.\nWhile creating the client, I rewrote god.coffee. I had to change god a bit so that the new version can just be dropped in at any time.\n  Justification:\n\nFor a negative goal like saveThangs, let's say you have 5 thangs on the save list.  As things stand, if you don't have a HowMany defined, then the number of needed deaths to fail is \n\nnumNeeded = _.size(stateThangs) - Math.min((goal.howMany ? 1), _.size stateThangs) + 1\nnumNeeded = 5 - Math.min(1, 5) + 1\nnumNeeded = 5\n\nSo you would only fail the goal if all 5 thangs you were supposed to save died.  This is contrary to the comment right above this line:\n\nsaveThangs: by default we would want to save all the Thangs, which means that we would want none of them to be \"done\"\n\nTherefore, I think it should be Math.max rather than Math.min.\n\nnumNeeded = _.size(stateThangs) - Math.max((goal.howMany ? 1), _.size stateThangs) + 1\nnumNeeded = 5 - Math.max(1, 5) + 1\nnumNeeded = 1\n\nSo any of the Thangs on the save list dying is enough to fail the goal.\n\nAs a double check, what if the level designer designated a HowMany of 5?\n\nnumNeeded = _.size(stateThangs) - Math.max((goal.howMany ? 1), _.size stateThangs) + 1\nnumNeeded = 5 - Math.max(5, 5) + 1\nnumNeeded = 1\n\nSo this is consistent.\n  For compound goals like GetAllToLocation, you should continue adding to the existing list of thang states.\n  We currently have a view for seeing chat history but this makes client side calls to hipchat. We need to inline this in the current site and create a backend for it because\n1. Hipchat API keys need to be stored on the server to avoid giving too much access to people\n2. We can cache history so we don't go beyond the API rate limits (100 requests in 5 minutes)\n\nThis would need to integrate with codecombat's existing mechanism for storing secure keys.\n That was the plan either way, it's a GitHub repository as well (without the key, though it's a non-admin one) so if you allow me some time you can just get it from there and plug in a key.\nI'm just putting the room selection / calendar elsewhere.\n Probably best to include it in codecombat's website code even if it isn't initially styled as part of the site proper (though I'm sure that's possible too)\n @rubenvereecken time to store it to mongo :tada: \n A simple implementation of something like this can be found [here](popey456963.github.io/HC) but does not contain any caching.\n    Translate some strings\n \u611f\u8c22\u53c2\u4e0e~\n @nwinter Ok, I have already signed CLA :)\n  Example:  codecombat.com/play/level/mod-squad-supplies-party\n\nBasically, I added the pickMushroom(), buySmallPotion(), buyMediumPotion(), buyLargePotion() methods, but if the user tries to call them, they get the error:\n\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'pickMushroom' of undefined\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/2870758/9745c9a4-d2de-11e3-882b-d6e85873d0b1.png)\n\nIt works with http://codecombat.com/play/level/mod-squad-supplies-party?skip_protect_api=true\n https://github.com/codecombat/aether/blob/master/src/protectAPI.coffee\n\nPoking around a bit, I notice that protectAPI.coffee makes mention of value.apiMethods in addition to value.apiProperties.  The HasAPI component allows for specifying apiProperties, but not apiMethods.\n\nThe Programmable component is supposed to add methods to apiMethods here:\n\nfor prop in _.union @programmableProperties, @extraProgrammableProperties\n      api = if _.isFunction(thang[prop]) then thang.apiMethods else thang.apiProperties\n      api.push prop unless prop in api\n\nbut I'm wondering if _.isFunction is correctly identifying any non-built-in methods correctly as methods.\n I've tested and submitted a patch to the Programmable component that should fix this issue.  Awaiting approval.\n\nDo patches normally automatically alert someone that approval is needed, or should I be creating issues for each one?  I have a few that have been waiting for approval for a week or so.\n There's a watcher system set up so anyone (particularly creators) can get notifications when patches are submitted, but we haven't seeded existing components with our watchful eyes. Since it looks like patches are coming steadily now we'll make a habit of checking for new ones regularly, but it can't hurt to bring it to our attention through various channels. In general you might poke us at our public HipChat room. It's linked to in the level editor in the drop down in the upper right.\n Huh, I could have sworn it worked when I tested it a few days ago with the patch, but I just checked it again now and you're right.\n I've altered the level so Richard is allowed to use moveXY().  Calling this.moveXY() doesn't produce the error, but calling this.pickMushroom() does.\n @gosnat Until I figure this one out, we figured out a workaround, which is to add a misc Component to handle adding those custom methods. A few examples: misc.KMeansReferee, misc.CrissCrossPlayer, etc. Now we just need it so you can author new Components on the site without admin permissions. Let me know if you want me to create any specialized misc Components like this for you.\n We've been just putting these methods in the programmableProperties list and assigning them from the Referee or a custom Component, and it works fine.\n  translate others that was not translated.\n  translating all strings there - having dificvulty with \"thang\" though - leaving as is untill I grasp the concept\n I personally wouldn't translate Thang. It's just what it is. There are some other words that were left untranslated because there doesn't exist a real Dutch word for it or the translation would just sound weird/awkward.\n I'm not sure I agree there.\n\nMy personal arguments:\n1/ We use coderdombat with kids in coderdojo and to them (specially -12y)\nall english is hard and adding hurdles - bad enough the language\n(javascript) doesn't translate - the\n2/ I agree it's often hard to find a good translation, but being hard makes\nit a nicer challenge to achieve\n3/ There are fine examples (translations of the whole Harry Potter series?)\nof weird words that find great translations - thanks to some guidance about\nwhat the \"intention or meaning is\"\n\nSo if \"Thang\" is medieval sounding slang for \"Thing\"  then something like\n\"Dingsel\" of \"Gedingte\" might be a very good candidate translation in Dutch.\n\nBut finally I would like to hear if the codecombat-authors about principles\nand line of thinking in this.\nWhat are the prime goals here?\n- give it as much local feel and acceptance to lower the boundaries to\n  acceptance -- assuring bigger communities even local\n- balance towards higher interchangeability and collaboration between\n  localized groups\n\n-marc=\n\n2014-05-03 9:37 GMT+02:00 JasperDhaene notifications@github.com:\n\n> I personally wouldn't translate Thang.

I can probably do this as part of (or when I've done) #111 \n It would also be cool to display levels' average ratings and number of ratings with this, too.\n  Discovered today that its a problem with the sprite parser or builder with Anya. Anya will be reverted soon so that this bug will stop breaking these levels. I'll figure out what's going on tomorrow.\n  The Munchkin F Thang has an invalid maxSpeed in the movement.Moves component.  It can't be corrected manually since the component has a bad config schema.  I've submitted a patch for the component config schema (pending approval), but I don't see a way to edit the Thang.\n  Two more that I've noticed.  There could be others as well.\n\nPeasant F\nArcher M\n\nI believe it's the same issue as this:\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/749\n  Just for Wuu Chinese, including Shanghainese and such language in Zhejiang Province, China.\n  Right now if you're logged out and try to play a ladder game, you're asked to sign up. Like Ruben suggested, we should probably show the login modal instead and have a signup link at the bottom(like the existing login modal).\n Glad you opened up an issue for this, thanks :)\n\nEDIT: Didn't see Nick's reaction earlier. \nMostly I think it'd be very confusing for a user, because logging in and signing up has become such a fundamental thing for people to do on the internet. I even get annoyed by the fact that Facebook's \"Log in\" doesn't match Google's \"Sign In\"...\n Do you know any other services that do this? I'm open to this idea, but I think it would be pretty novel in terms of UX and perhaps confusing for the user. I'm especially concerned about the case where a user incorrectly enters their email, just mashes whatever button we put in front of them, then is angry because they don't see their progress (which is on the older account.)\n We could mimic Meteor's default login/signup system. When you click \"sign in / up\", you get a modal like this:\n\n![screen shot 2014-05-01 at 9 30 13 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/204723/2854196/f07b26fa-d14d-11e3-8a7f-88056616d031.png)\n\nI didn't spend the time figuring out how to configure social media buttons like facebook or gplus, but it looks like you've got them at the top with the standard form below. If you click 'create account' at the bottom:\n\n![screen shot 2014-05-01 at 9 31 34 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/204723/2854201/166afeee-d14e-11e3-9fab-c22fad3bf921.png)\n\nIt expands the form with the appropriate fields, changes the form buttons. If you typed something into the log in fields, they're already in the fields in the create account form. I think we can do something like this, in which case it would become a single modal. I'd prefer this over having the system try to smartly figure out if the user is trying to sign up or create an account. I think it's better to just let the user decide for themselves by clicking the 'create account' button or not.\n  These appear to be all gone.\n  When you play the level with the default code, you will end up dying. When you try going back in time, Tharin still seems to lay dead on the ground. See screenshot below.\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-30 at 2 17 16 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2319795/2835353/0d257b0a-cfe8-11e3-8a37-0449073aced5.png)\n\nStrangely, this only happens if you rewind back to around 0:01-0:03 in the timeline.\n  In the level editor, if you select a thang from the \"Add Thang\" list and then try to add it to the level, it will be added twice in the same location.  Chrome shows no errors in the console, but Firebug shows hundreds of the same error that spawns perpetually until you kill the page:\n# \n\nTypeError: o is undefined\n\n...on(t){return t.get(\"name\")===e.spriteName}),a=this.createSpriteOptions({thang:e}...\n\napp.js (line 803)\n# \n\nLine 803 is this:\n\nreturn null==t&&(t=null),this.sprites[e.id]?console.warn(\"Tried to add Thang to the surface it already has:\",e.id):(o=_.find(this.options.thangTypes,function(t){return t.get(\"name\")===e.spriteName}),a=this.createSpriteOptions({thang:e}),a.resolutionFactor=\"Floor\"===o.get(\"kind\")?2:4,i=new n(o,a),this.addSprite(i,null,t),i.setDebug(this.debug),i)},t.prototype.removeSprite=function(e){var\n Can someone else verify this behavior so I know it's not just me?\n OK, good to know it isn't just me.  At a quick glance, I didn't see any commits from the last 24 hours that would be related to this.  It was working the morning of April 28, and not working as of creating this issue.\n Could this be related to this commit?\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/02a74ae40c0e71023aa12a79566821f3eb8af55f\n\nThis bug is making it impossible to create and edit levels right now.\n Thanks for your patience @gosnat! Managed to break these things right before we spent a bunch of time moving our office. I hope to have the level editor in tip-top shape real soon though.\n Thanks for working to fix it up.  Good luck with the move.\n  Fixed ID for harvest-time level (was pointing to find-the-spy)\n  I am extremely dissatisfied the support of CodeCombat internationalization by programmers. Make changes to the requirements of the new code; it must be completely covered by the i18n tags reflected in en.coffee.\n  In the Level Editor, if you select a Thang from the \"Add Thangs\" list on the right side of the screen, the list disappears, and you have to reload the page to get it back so you can select another thang.\n\nI've had this happen in both Chrome and Firefox starting last Friday.  No errors in the javascript console.\n Closing this since it appears to have been fixed a while ago.\n  When you add a \"How Many\" attribute for a \"Save Thangs\" goal, you get the documentation text \"When included, require only this many of the listed targets instead of all of them\", which implies that without a \"How Many\" listed, the goal should succeed only if all of the listed targets survive.  \n\nHowever, for the level http://codecombat.com/editor/level/find-the-spy I found that listing 4 targets along and skipping the How Many attribute would result in a success as long as one target survived.  I had to include a How Many of 4 to require all 4 targets to remain alive.\n\nBelow you can see a screeshot of the level without a \"How Many\" listed.  Note that only one of the 4 soldiers survived, but the goal is still a success.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/2812099/78054c1e-ce41-11e3-8a32-774cf6d0d8fc.png)\n\nAlso, oddly enough the \"Kill Thangs\" goal without a \"How Many\" does in fact require all targets to die to succeed.\n I don't believe the fix has hit the production server yet, but https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/966 should fix this.\n\nThe two problems dealing with \"howMany\" were actually separate problems.\n  New update for \"fr.coffee\"\n Date: Sun, 27 Apr 2014 09:42:24 -0700\nFrom: notifications@github.com\nTo: codecombat@noreply.github.com\nCC: belian_maieslav@hotmail.fr\nSubject: Re: [codecombat] Update fr.coffee (#924)\n\nHi @belian, thanks for adding those translations! I saw a couple indentation inconsistencies, so I fixed them up and have merged it in. Can I get you to sign the CLA? Thanks!\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\nOk, i have signed the CLA :) . Have a nice day.                       \n  It took me a while to figure out why I've trashed a level and had to roll back a few times.  At least one thing that will trash a level (make it unrenderable and uneditable) is if you edit a unit Thang (I verified with the Peasant M thang, haven't tested extensively with other Thang types) and remove the collision.Collides component.  If you go back to the main Thangs tab, you get an empty level regardless of what else you had before.  Some times I still get the list of thangs on the left, but the render window will be empty and gray.  Today, however, I just get a straight-up blank screen.\n\nThe associated javascript console errors are:\n\nLyle couldn't find dependent Component 524b7b857fc0f6d519000012 from Moves app.js:1354\no app.js:1354\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'original' of undefined \n  I have checked this locally but easier to make change in github\n  As promised in #880\n  Yep, i try, you are right.\ni suggest we should use regular expression on front end and back end. Verification twice.\ni can't fix the problem because i'm busying on my own thing. sorry.\n Fun fact: only 600 users have registered without an @ sign in their email. \n If I get a green light I'd like to include [isemail](https://github.com/globesherpa/node-isemail) on the server (I believe Dominik linked the javascript version) and simply add a :valid CSS pseudo-selector to the user creation form..\n\nHere's the extensive test suite from the original isemail: http://isemail.info/_system/is_email/test/?all\n A different approach would be to send out an e-mail verification and nag the user every time he plays without verifying.\n isemail could be used anyway, of course\n I'd like to have that in addition, we want to make sure we can communicate something to a user through their email. So you can only sign up for stuff if your email is verified. GitHub, for example, only allows you to add email addresses but you can only change to it another as primary once it's verified.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't do the dns check that isemail offers. It's overkill, and a fail will result in a user's account not being created on the server while his state on the client is changed to 'anonymous:false'. Either we change the way a user gets logged in immediately after creating (to counter the latter) or relax the server check and rely on email verification.\n The request could also be kept open until the DNS check returns.\n I'd like to finally implement this. Let's not do email verification, at least not until it proves necessary. \n\nWe would, however, do both a client-sided (`:valid`) and server-sided (`isemail`) validity check. The client presumes that as soon as the user manages to push the Create Account button (which is then enabled thanks to `:valid`), the email address is indeed valid and then resumes as it does now. It does not wait for feedback from the server. The server however may return an error, in which case we may assume the user is being a jerk and they deserve being falsely logged in until they reload. The client does not take this into account\n\nAlternative: The client waits for feedback from the server before it continues. This is a tad bit weird because that would mean it could still show an error _after_ enabling its Create Account button.\n How strict do you want the email validity check? A simple aa@bb.cc requirement, or something more strict? Currently aa@bb passes but the '@' is required since type is email.\n\nAdditionally, what would you want to happen on the server-side if the email is not valid?\n If signup button is pressed with an email that isn't aa@bb.cc (checks on server side, shows the error message if it fails the regex and doesn't continue with signup): \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8417980/8420747/fcb84d28-1e7a-11e5-8fef-d4694d4a3dac.png)\n\nIs this similar to what you wanted?\n Ah, I apologize, I did not fully understand the server side part then. For server side, it should pass the client side, successfully go through the sign up process and get logged in. Meanwhile, a second check will be done and if it fails, display an error to user (or do something else)?\n I think there was already a validation of the email, that still appears if you enter something random without the '@' symbol. Shouldn't it be removed now, or is it to be kept?\nLooks like this:\n![sem titulo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6980488/8440784/75ec85aa-1f6c-11e5-9ef0-4ed93ffc23fb.png)\n Ok, thought it was CodeCombat specific.\n I can remove that though (the browser  @ symbol one) since just the type needs to be changed for that to go away\n Hi guys, is this issue fully resolved yet? I want to work on email validation on server side, where could I get started?\nI also notice this line `email: c.shortString({title: 'Email', format: 'email'})` from `\\app\\schemas\\models\\user.coffee`, isn't it enough already?\n  When you create a level, if you go to the \"Systems\" tab and try to look at the UI system, it has several properties that are there, but cannot be viewed or editted:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/2793429/4113dd42-cbdf-11e3-8794-78bc074cd1c9.png)\n\nIf you delete the UI system and then re-add it, then you can view and edit: \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6819822/2793444/73e1aa92-cbdf-11e3-8b3a-25f047dc680d.png)\n\nI first noticed this when I was trying to add indieSprites and was unable to do so by default without deleting and re-adding the UI system.\n OK, I just did another test, and you're correct that adding the configuration to the UI system then puts it into the state that I was looking for.  I could have sworn that it didn't do that earlier, but that might have been chrome flaking out.  I think you can probably ignore this issue.  Sorry.\n  I have translated part of it. please check it for mistakes and add it to your page if all is alright. in few days i\u2018ll try to translate to the end\n  Added responsive view for Level Editor. Sidebars are collapsible and tabs are set in vertical order.\n @sderickson\nI fixed problem with tremas, but there is problem with canvas.\nWhen window width is bigger than height and there are no margins on left and right, canvas don't resize right. Is it set to certain aspect ratio?\n![codecombat1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7010281/2835114/141c26dc-cfe5-11e3-8946-d861635be7c4.png)\n\n@nwinter \nIt limits image width, but obviously it don't work for all images. It's now corrected to max-width.\n\nThanks for suggestions. \n  Robert Corey uploaded a Youtube video showing several issues with the image upload widget: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YceQ1Cj3OLg&feature=youtu.be\n\nAfter uploading his image, the image doesn't appear and the row formatting appears to be messed up.\n\nOS: Linux Mint 16 \"Petra\"\nChrome: Version 34.0.1847.116 \n    Various sections translated\n Hi @marianoluzza thanks for these translations!

I've deleted all the thangs in a level and there are then no components listed. If I add a thang (say a barrel), and switch to components, components are shown (Collides, Exists and Physical in previous example).\n It happens as soon as you add the next component. It looks like it's because of an optimization where I stopped having the level thang editor emit the thangs changed event all the time because it was slowing things down terribly (the whole surface is recreated each time). If you close the editor for the thang back to the general thangs tab view, the event is then emitted.\n\nAnyway, will fix soon.\n    @nick, I can go press backspace in treema to delete a property like rotationType. The only catch I've found is if the ThangType takes 1000ms to render like \"Built Human Barracks in 1105ms on main thread.\" for http://codecombat.com/editor/thang/human-barracks, that's the amount of time you wait between pressing backspace and the property finally disappearing from treema.\nEdit: I do see the issue now: These deletes don't actually show up in delta and actually happen.\n   Aha, now i see it.\nI noticed on the site that the text corresponding with `got_questions` was still in english, so i searched for the tag, did not immediately see it in en.coffee, and presumed it was missing. I should've been more thorough here...\n\nAs you pointed out, it _is_ in en.coffee, but not in any of the other locale files, so something must've gone wrong with the script that puts the tags in other locale files. (I thought this was @sderickson's script?)\n\nFor the corrections: _opgeslagen_ is of course a valid translation, but on a one-word button, like _comment_ or _cancel_, it is imo better to translate 'save' to _opslaan_.\n\nThe conjugation in save_version_title however was incorrect, or just really weird sounding (when we're talking in _beschaafd Nederlands_ of course. I say it just like you do in dialect ;p ).\n\nAs you can see, i can still make some mistakes, so you probably merged this in to quickly. If you leave it like this i'll fix it in my next pull request.\n No It's ok. Before I merge in I check the commits quite carefull. But to not fuck up your history, I had to  pull that wrong commit as well, just made an extra commit afterwards to fix it again. @nwinter do you know why `got_questions` is not in the other localisation files?\n  My 2 cents: It's also in the wrong place I think. It expands the top of the leaderboard before the ellipsis so probably should be sited there. Maybe the ellipsis themselves should link. I'd expand it a little less each time too: it's unexpected larger after clicking (maybe ten more).\n  So with the new patch system i want to translate some levels, but i've been annoyed with the level editor quite a few times now. The current view of 'click the + button to add new properties' is really great for beginners to see what options/properties there are available, but it's really annoying if your making long dialogues for levels or, in my case now, translating an existing level.\n\nThat's why it would be SUPER-helpful if you could just edit the plain-text JSON behind that view so you could easily copy-paste solutions, search for i18n tags (because at the moment it's not really fun to search for those things) and edit out any errors which sometime occur with null's at the end of actions (see issue #141 )\n  I don't think we need to stop users editing systems like this anymore. Components doesn't seem to have this restriction either.\n Cool. Yeah that makes sense. I'll do that.\n i'll hide the Create options for components and systems for non-admins while I'm at it if no one else gets to it\n Should have the original work here soon (changing read only unless admin to writable unless anonymous everywhere): just need to retest things.\n  Hi!\nI have translated the remaining lines. I have not tested all the text yet in order to remove overflowing or cut off texts (I had to modify two lines to avoid a couple of linguistic bugs) but I hope to do it soon.\nCheers!\n Thank you! It\u00b4s great to help in such a wonderful project!!\n   How or why can a fork lose a file? Did I make a mistake? If yes, how can I \"sync it with CodeCombet's master of fork a fresh copy\"? What button/s shall I click on?\nSorry for being a problem person. If you think I make more trouble than good, just tell me so (kick me out).\n I have looked at the home page address you suggested I \"might want to look at\". It told me what to do all right, but did not tell me how to do it. So please see my previous comment.\n ### If you have a GUI\n\nI presume you use the Github GUI or something similar since you asked \"what buttons to click on\"?\nI'm not really experienced with those GUIs, because most of the time they just gave me problems and they're not as powerful/versatile as the command line. \n\nI also presume you have cloned your forked repository to your computer? If not, skip this section.\n\nIf you've got any of those GUIs installed you should be able to start 'Git Bash', as it is the 'core program' where all GUIs run on. From there you should `cd` to the directory where you saved your local copy of the CodeCombat repo. This should go like `cd path/to/repo` Once you've arrived there, there should appear '(master)' right next to your pathname. From there you should just follow all the commands from that link to synch your fork.\n\n### If you edit on Github itself.\n\nI did this a few times. It's super easy when you don't want the hassle of pulling/editing/pushing. I only recommend it for translations though. I think it's possible to 'fork a fresh copy' by just clicking the 'fork' button on the upper right of the CodeCombat repo once again. I'm not entirely sure though because i already had the latest commits.\n\n### To answer your other questions\n\nA fork can't lose a file. A fork is just a copy of the original repository (as it was at that moment!) onto your own Github account. Therefore, any commits to the CodeCombat repo will not appear on your fork, unless you synch it manually.\n\nYes, in this case it seems you've made a mistake, but that's not a problem at all! I made the same mistake myself. You just somehow deleted some of the file. I did this by erroneous copy-pasting. Maybe you did something similar.\n\nAnd you're not a problem person. As you see, i've written a lengthy response to help you, as most of us here are to help other people if they can. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n  Hi guys, i was really frustrated when i could not run the multiplayer 'cast a spell' more than 3-5 times.

But I'm sure that it's much better with this param since it takes much less time for simulation and it does not give those annoying 'infinite loop' messages.  And the memory usage growth during simulation is much slower. \n  If a system is added, it is added to treema at the end of the list of systems. Treema then raises it's changed event resulting in this order being set on the level. The next time a system is added, the first system is in it's correct position and so the delta shows it as moving. This changes ensures we save the correct order in the first instance.\n\nThere is a wider issue of adding systems resulting in misleading deltas. I've submitted one-time fix to Michael  to reorder systems correctly on levels in the mongo database to avoid adding a system resulting in multiple deltas relating to pre-existing systems. The fix in this PR seems to fix the majority of this issue after the one-time fix is applied. I've got a further fix to how we configure the json differ that seems to be required in a couple of instances but I want to look at this again more thoroughly to understand what's going on.\n Better to merge this into production first so they don't get any further out of order between running fix and putting this in. \n   There a few other related changes needed here to breadcrumbs and removing the old editors page so I'll amend this in a bit.\n If we remove the old editors page, will /editors redirect to /community (in case anybody has it bookmarked): would we do this in code or is there a redirect config file somewhere?\n  Fix issues mentioned in #857, and do following changes:\n1. Change ladder_view and its tab views, make them use new SuperModel.\n2. Fix some bugs of Resource Value.\n3. Remove dependency management in SuperModel. For those need dependency, I simply add check to see if its dependent is loaded, if not so, just try again later.\n\nI only go through all features to check if they work. Please let me know if there's any further issue under certain cases, thanks. \n I only put onLoaded into Cocoview and do some tests. Previously I implement this function in each child due to strange behavior of render() in some views, but it seems to work now.\n\nAlso, please feel free to put any change to this branch. I am be very busy these weeks, so I'll not make major change in the short time.\n    Thank you in advance:sushi:\n Oops, I forgot it. I think everything is OK now. But can you tell me if there are something I should do? Thanks.\n Thanks, I tried it on https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/890 :)\n    That interface is gone now, yay.\n    While running coco-brunch, I get this error:\nerror: Compiling of 'app/styles/editor/level/edit.sass' failed.

I've amended.\n  An error was coming up in console every time you switched tabs.\n  I can`t type 's' in code editor, perhaps shift-s works fine. maybe, 's' is some hotkey? windows8x64, chrome(in win8 or desktop mode), usb keyboard(if this is important).\n Hi antomy,\nthat's a strange error. \nDoes the key work in all other programs?\nIf you reload the page, is the error still there?\nWhat keyboard language do you use?\n Hi. \nKey works fine in all other apps. Error appears each time I open the page. Russian(RU-ru) and english(EN-us) languages installed in the system\n Can you open the error console https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console?hl=de#opening_the_console and see if some error pops up once you press the key? \n There`s no errors in console, but just now I noticed that this bug appears only when russian language selected while loading page\n 'p' works fine, but 'g' didn`t work too. This bug appears only if russian layout is selected while loading page, and then switching to english one. Else everything works fine\n  Translate some\n Hi @onion7878 thanks for these translations! Could you please [sign the CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla), it doesn't take long, this way we can merge in your first awesome contribution! Welcome to our community!!!\n I just sign it with `Github Username \uff1a onion7878`\n  I just tried uploading the new colorizable fangrider sprite that Pavel handed us, and the color tab appears to be broken: http://codecombat.com/editor/thang/ogre-fangrider\n\nThe JS console doesn't report anything suspicious, but I'm unable to see the \"colors\" tab at all.\n  #784, #815\n\nChange views to fit new Supermodel. Also fix ladder_view and ladder_tab_view mentioned in #815\n  Both her portrait and attack animations appear to be busted now that I've uploaded the new attack animation. You can check out the twitching over here: \n\nhttp://codecombat.com/editor/thang/anya\n  Currently if something fails to load from localStorage, the whole page is prevented from loading, since the function console.warning doesn't exist.\n\nI've changed the call to console.warn which fixes this.\n It only happened on my development environment intermittently and I can't seem to reproduce it now.\n\nIt looked like it had something to do with the gplusToken, and happened when loading the homepage.\n  This sets the shadow's alpha to the same as the thang's\n  Hope this is okay.\n Just added splitting simulate tab commit. This is all rebased onto latest master.\n Sorry. I'll amend that last commit back to 20 players.\n Ok. It should show the full list for you now.\n  Adding the \"Find the Spy\" level to the user created list.\n Done\n  Currently, the route _queue/scoring_ needs a user to be logged in.\nI don't see a need in this and allowing anonymous simulation would make the automated simulation easier, too.\n Wouldn't it be simpler to recalculate conflicting games on the server and ban the ip that returned a wrong result? Do you fear many users will tamper with the results? \n I'm marking this as wontfix. I don't think this is a good idea right now.\n\n@domenukk I know you were working on the headless simulator, is this still an issue? Feel free to reopen as needed.\n    Fixes #822. When an anon user tries to signup with a name that might have been taken, it removes the name and creates a user. I wasn't sure how we should go about with warning a user that his name would be reset and I'd like to get some feedback on that before implementing it. Any ideas?\n @sderickson I haven't worked with the tests, but I can give it a shot. Can you guide me as to where I should be adding?\n Thanks, I'll give it a shot!\n  This implements #703\nThis currently looks like this:\n![topsimulatorstable](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/396538/2688538/229c0478-c2a9-11e3-8b7d-d1e81148e2fb.jpg)\n\nI still need to figure out how to add my strings for internationalization. I'm also concerned I'm returning more of the user objects than needed: is this a problem?\n Yeah I can do these.\n  So, I admit I don't have a very good bandwidth, but still the landing page takes way too long to load. Check out my network tab from Chrome developer console-\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-12 at 9 40 39 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2319795/2687247/9353aa46-c244-11e3-9980-a9e03076aa25.png)\n\nSo I'm basically stuck with a brown background for half a minute! Nick suggested that we could add a static HTML page which would be replaced once the Backbone app has loaded.\n Since we split everything up and did the module loading system, we got the homepage load down to 1.3MB, whereas before it must have been like 6MB or more. It could always go lower, but this is pretty good.\n  Translate items under editor to Simplified Chinese.\n Hi @julycoolwind, thanks for the translations.

I wasn't sure what to do with server/routes/languages.coffee(it doesn't seem like it's being used) so I haven't deleted that.\n\nLet me know if there is anything else that should be done as well.\n\nEdit: Ahh, I pulled the updated code only later and found changes to some schemas along with the new Patch schema. Modified accordingly.\n  Won't this just require a change in the waterfall function for the name setting? Adding a anonymous:false as a query parameter to User.findOne should do the trick. And again, if a user does signup, put does run waterfall checks again so if anyone did claim the name in the interim, it would not be saved.\n\nWould that be correct, @nwinter?\n  @schmatz If we make the simulator reload the page every hour and keep simulating, that'll fix this (and a bunch of other stuff) more easily.\n  #784\n\nI merge my ResourceManager with SuperModel to make it accepts all kinds of resources, and I reserve SuperModel's original functions so view should change as less as possible. If this new supermodel is good enough, I'd proceed to move logic of progress bar and retry block from CocoView to RootView. Currently sub-view's render() also influence that part, thus imposing unnecessary progress checking code in render().\n After merging master into my dev branch, I get \n`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined`\nIt seems jquery is not compiled into js files.\n\nI have tried bower update and npm update, but both don't work.\nAny ideas?\n Solved, thanks.\n  We could probably pass @otherSession from level_view when it calls setSpells [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level_view.coffee#L442)?\n  at start(everything normal):\n![11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1804755/2667670/ce1feb3e-c0b0-11e3-87e6-213708014fb1.png)\n\nafter click \"play\",  game play a little bit, then i drag Progress Bars(something wrong):\n![22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1804755/2667671/cf7dd37e-c0b0-11e3-84a9-c7d08da03fa9.png)\nnow i can't do anything, literally anything.\nonly thing i can do just refresh page.\n\nlink: http://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeon-arena?team=ogres\nsystem: windows7 x64\nbrowser: chrome,  version: 33\n\nbut if i let the progress bar continue move, not to drag it.\neverything fine:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1804755/2667747/a3f47e50-c0b1-11e3-99bf-4d361aa26187.png)\n\nso the problem is if you drag progress bar when game just play little bit.\nthe game will freeze, you can't do anything.\n  I think this is because ObjectIds are 24 characters long in MonogDb, and this could lead to a potential conflict if you set your name to that same length as it might be the same as someone's id.

If so, I will do it later, in next pull req.\n OK, Than I shall review this merge request later today, and merge it into the master branch if everything is fine. Thank you for the hard work man. And I'm sorry for what I did. Now that I know that you are the Russian Guru, I'll make sure to not repeat this mistake! :)\n  Cleaned up some of the code related to nanoscroller as per Nick's suggestions of my previous pull request.\n    if (!this.getCooldown('terrify') <-- here\n    this.terrify();\n\nif (this.canCast('poison-cloud', enemy) <-- here\n    this.castPoisonCloud(enemy);\n helping is a pleasure :D\n  When I restore the database dump, mongorestore crashes while loading levels so it doesn't import media or systems at all. If I delete the levels bson and metadata file after calling mongorestore once, it will then load media and systems when I call mongorestore again. \n  After updating master branch today, I cannot load thang in thang editor. (got 422 error)\nI also tried to download the newest dump, update db, and recreate an user, but I got error message (Must have an identity to do anything with the db. Do you have cookies enabled?). \nI guess it's due to db auth settings, is there any change in recent update?\n  Hi @sderickson \n\nBefore I proceed to other views, I'd like to let you review my changes on CocoView c5d2c307b1\n\nI do some change on updateProgress() in CocoView so it has no needs to check every resources when updating.\n\nAlso, I have some questions about the resources:\n1. Does every model or collection use fetch()? If so, we may move that part into addResourceToLoad(), since onResourceLoadFailed() needs jqxhr as argument, which can only be acquired from the return value.\n2. In onResourceLoadFailed() and onRequestLoadFailed() we change $el without rendering the view, is it okay to assume that onLoaded() would not be called unless all resources are successfully loaded, otherwise a \"retry block\" shows somewhere next to progress bar? So far I'm not sure if render() should be called no matter there's any error.\n Sorry for my poor wording. :p\n\nWhat I mean of Q2 is, should we still render the page even though error occurs? My idea is that if we do not call render(), the page may not be shown, including error message. After some testings this seems not be a problem. We can use current design if the reloading index works properly.\n\nAlso for one, I will adopt your idea.\n\nThanks for your advice!\n I found some tricky parts in editor views, they may take time to resolve.\nCould you create a branch for this issue? So I can commit new CocoView at first, then migrate each view by steps. Other participants can also work on this branch.\n 16fe28ff5594039369d9f2124f35a6d7df0c98cd\n\nI plan to extract resource management part from CocoView to a new class. Also I try to manage dependencies of resources so that we wouldn't need to check if all resources are loaded in afterRender().\n\nAn issue I concern about is that LevelLoader and SuperModel have their own resource management logic. If we migrate to new loading logic, these two classes may break. I think I need more info of how they interact with resources, could you give me any advice?\n I prefer to separate loading logic from view. Let loader to manage state of resources, so view doesn't need to worry about synchronizing the loading. We can use event to bridge view and loader, minimize their coupling. I'll try to make SuperModel accept all resources, and handle dependency among them.\n The new loading system is stable enough. The only views that have really been properly migrated are the ladder view and the level loader-using views. Everything else needs to be moved over. The best way to find them is to search for the following regex in /app/views:\n\n`listenToOnce.+, ['\"]sync`\n  Hi! this is my first contribution to an open source, so any feedback is very much appreciated!\nI looked over the wiki, and i was having trouble finding out how to launch the app to test myself, or write tests for it. Please let me know if theres anymore i should do, thanks!\n @nwinter thanks for reviewing my submission! To be honest, when i was going over the original code i wasnt entirely sure why it wasnt working either. if the levels are stored on github (i couldnt find them), and you do decide to make this change, id be happy go through them and make the change to set the type to campaign.\n\nill be sure to keep browsing the 'good-for-newbies' tab and see if theres any other low hanging fruit i can work on \n   @nwinter, signed. :)\n    Do you know where the code is for the nav bar?\n I feel like the easiest solution is to limit the username button's width so this won't happen, I'll keep digging through the code to see where I can do this.\n Gah yeah that could complicate things, is there a possibility that the left and right margins be lessened to take account of both of these issues?\n Or could the admin button be pushed to the footer of the page?\n Okay I can see what I can do about the admin button first and see what I can do from there\n That would be in another file right? Where I can move the button?\n I tried that and the admin button stayed in the header\n Okay that moved it down, should the word \"Admin\" be changed for the different languages?\n Ohhh okay, so I wouldn't need to do anything with that? And I think the admin move solved the issue since the username at its max width doesn't throw anything off anymore\n Okay so I don't know if this is a new issue or if this is supposed to happen but when I clicked on the new admin button I get this:\n\n![selection_005](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6885216/2619131/3a127102-bc2b-11e3-957a-740e516f81c1.png)\n Should it be scrolling down the page like that, cutting off the header?\n No you even miss the title. There is probably some css that you forgot to set correctly, after refactoring this code. I do like the repositioning of the admin button, so keep going :+1: \n All I did was move the button to the header, what css would make it do this?\n This is where I added the admin button on base.jade:\n\n![selection_006](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6885216/2619994/7fe12974-bc37-11e3-8522-92098976b243.png)\n I can't exactly do that since my other work with the WebGL project will pull with the request, but the update of base.jade is on my fork at:\n\nhttps://github.com/therealbond/codecombat/commit/be492a2a586229d085f7052f10bf26a4d53d1451\n  For some reason some of the new components don't have the latest version in the db dump. For example the movement.Teleports component seems to have the second to last version compared to the live site.\n Just checked , the live site has 0.7 version while the db has 0.6\n   Yeah wasn't sure :) will keep it in mind :)\n  The target for all my units died, and afterwards all of my units ran in random directions.\n\n[Here is a screenshot that hopefully will illustrate the problem.](http://i.imgur.com/UUI2LdX.png)\n    ukrainian localization\n  Added contextmenu with delete and duplicate buttons for thangs.\n  Fixes #745 \n\nHere I add a new library to /vendor\n\nAt first I tried to silently add missing system, but this may cause extra database load mention in the discussion, so I just add a message so far.\n    Fix error \"SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\" when running setup.py script\n  The Thang affected by terrify never recovers regardless of the ability duration.\n  \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043b \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 join_desc_3, \u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e.\nAdded a space into start of string variable \"join_desc_3\" otherwise in the text written all together.\n  If you try to place a Female Soldier Thang, the javascript console starts to fill up with \"Uncaught Type Error: Cannot read property 'relatedActions' of undefined\" errors.

I wasn't too sure whether I should create a pull request or issue for this, but I wanted to throw out there what I've already got concerning the integration of the new mediator into CodeCombat.\n\nThe goal (issue #40): Have objects that get sent around for subscriptions follow schemas. This allows for documentation of what's flying around and easier debugging.\n\nWhat have we already got? A new Mediator that checks all objects it's supposed to publish against the schemas it's been provided with. This setup happens in `initialize.coffee`. All schemas reside in `schemas`. Schemas should be classified somewhat. To this purpose I've created an example `bus.coffee` (holding all bus related stuff) and `misc.coffee` (currently holding jQueryEvent). There are two kinds of schemas: schemas describing an object that goes through a channel and definition schemas that other schemas can refer to (more on this at the official json-schema docs). They serve as a core repository. To add to this, all model schemas should move to `app/schemas` as well but I haven't yet performed this refactoring.\n\nI don't have too much spare time on my hands for the following days, but I'll focus on supplying barebone files and definitions that other developers can add to. Together this should be a quick job, and an easy one at that.\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated!\n\nP.S. [Here](http://pastebin.com/rrpW9NUn)'s the grep output for `Backbone.Mediator.publish`. There is work to do.\n I'm having a couple of hellish days with uni deadlines (hence the sudden and of course striking absence), so I propose the following: Read it over if you want to and get back with tips or advice while the code is still fresh. Leave the Pull Request open and I'll get more stubs set up for people to fill in. That way the pull request is actually useful. I'll get back here with a comment when I feel there's something for people to work on.\n\nConcerning Bower: consider it at the top of my list! I'm new to it but I think I'll manage.\n\nThanks for the reviews!\n This has been ready for a week now except Bower integration. Simply moving\nthe JS file makes everything behave differently and of course, wrongly.\nMere frustrations withheld me from working to resolve that last bit of\ntrouble.\nOn Apr 9, 2014 4:34 AM, \"Scott Erickson\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @rubenvereecken https://github.com/rubenvereecken This good to go to\n> merge in and let the archmages know there are all these stubs to fill in,\n> or do you have anything remaining to do?\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/740#issuecomment-39923284\n> .\n  When using movement.Teleports on coin Thangs I came across a bug where some would appear outside the predefined teleporting area , from (0,0) , with an increasing scaleFactor and started to mess up the rest. \nPossible fix at https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee#L269-L277\n![crazy_coin1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6786777/2560139/b3aa4d92-b7ac-11e3-9892-3591d4916cc0.png)\n![crazy_coin4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6786777/2560140/b8972ca8-b7ac-11e3-96e0-1f4fb5ec30af.png)\n![crazy_coin5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6786777/2560141/b8abfc32-b7ac-11e3-9140-36d3c21079e6.png)\n![crazy_coin2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6786777/2560142/b8bc23b4-b7ac-11e3-9fc1-627750923692.png)\n  I noticed that when you make a Thang invisible you can still see the shadow \n  In bootstrap.sh there are a few lines that open a link in the browser.

This works fine on Linux operating systems like Ubuntu. However, on some other distributions such as Arch Linux \"gem install\" defaults to the a local folder in the users home directory.

If you always want the progress to set to the beginning regardless of session state, then you'd want nothing in 'Not After'. But if we want all ladder games to always start at the beginning, that might be something to just hardcode into the site.

I actually have it on my short list to build a generalized system for this, and this'll be good fodder for that, as well as provide an interim solution.\n\nI'd recommend having the error view use a template, though. We should avoid having views insert or handle DOM tags as much as possible, both so for example the text can be part of i18n system, and generally to keep template logic out of views.\n  All I had was that the Bus would be subclassed (it has the basics for a chatroom, the LevelBus just extends it with things like where your wizard is). It would be easy enough to add a general chat room on the site, or ones that are associated with specific pages (create a Bus based on the given url and you're pretty much there) but talking with friends will require a whole lot more foundation built, like a friends system and a general way to have views persist from one page to another.\n  I can do this.\n @nwinter Almost there with this. I'll try to send an PR later.\n   Not yet, @schmatz. I think you need to wait for the second commit, is not it, @AKeeper?\n @nwinter ? \n OK.\n  Unfortunately I don't have much detail about this bug.\n\nRecently I've been playing as a human team on the multiplayer Dungeon Arena.\n\nSometimes in simulated games, my team will lose.\n\nI click on the 'Defeat the ogres' link to watch my defeat, but in a large majority of cases (like 90%) my team actually wins.\n\nIs there a reason this happens? It seems like a bug to me. In particular, it seems like the simulation matches are executing code and finding winners in a _systematically_ different way than the visual matches.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know where to go looking for this bug, but I thought I'd make an issue so someone is aware. I can share my human code too, if that would be helpful in tracking the problem down.\n This is probably a duplicate of #651 \nIt happens when the code for either of the players has changed after the actual battle happened. The simulation you see later executes with the latest code, and hence the result might change.\n\nI think ensuring the simulation is displayed as it actually happened would be great, but it would probably be pretty difficult to implement, since we'd need to store previous versions of code for all battles.\n Possibly, but I'm not sure.\n\nMy code is not changing, and it seems unlikely that so many other players' code would change, especially in ways that make their teams weaker.\n To add more:\n\nI just checked the last 4 losses my team faced. All 4 losses were within the last 10 minutes. When I replayed them, only 1 remained a loss - the other 3 were wins.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, I'm sure it seems like my code must have changed without being resubmitted. But I can assure you that I keep reranking my team without changing the code. Yet I keep seeing this problem.\n\nPerhaps the bug is not in the simulation vs live execution, but somewhere in how the code is saved?\n I tried testing some more just now.\n1. I clicked \"Rank my game\" on the matches page.\n2. I checked my first 6 losses (each within a minute or two of the loss)\n3. 5 of the 6 losses were wins when I replayed them. I hadn't touched the code.\n\nHere's the code for my base: http://pastebin.com/EbfssV5y\nAnd here's the code for my hero: http://pastebin.com/SfD53QSq\n Oddly enough, on my latest run these errors have gone away. (I'm not sure why, because I haven't touched the code in many runs.) :smile: \n\n> Are the wins close matches?\n\nHard to say, but it doesn't seem like it. (I agree that if it were close, small random variations might explain the difference. But I don't think that's what's happening here.)\n\n> Are the enemies you're beating showing code errors or otherwise not moving?\n\nMaybe once or twice (against the early easy opponents), but no, not in general.\n\n> Do the match results play the same way in Firefox and Chrome?\n\nI've only been using Chrome. I can give Firefox a try later.\n  Changed the code so when the enter key will only work to call the login function when the he focus is on the password field and not on both input fields.\n  Fix for #666 \nThe solution turned out to be a little different from #558, is there a better way to access the team spells and create a thang-spell map instead of what I've done?\n  ![chart](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1329532/2521294/402041d0-b4a3-11e3-9370-74a1a5058d97.png)\n\nThis suddenly happened to me.\nNo, I did not go on a massive losing streak.

The guide modal is a good example where the content can get very long, so it needs to be possible.\n Ah, right. Sorry forgot about this case. I shall make the changes for this.\n At Nick- Correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't the width being constrained because of [this line](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/styles/play/spectate.sass#L26) in spectate.sass?\n So can we not add this max-width constraint to #spectate-level-view .level-content instead?\n I'll give it a try and make a thorough check before sending a pull request again. I just have one query- Does the /play/level view also need to be constrained to 1920px?\n Yes, I did notice that. That would require a Javascript library to be used. I'm thinking that we can fix the above issues through CSS and then the scrollbar showing up only when scrolling could be done through JS. Only part I am a little unsure of would be about Firefox, since it doesn't provide support for hiding scrollbars. What are your thoughts on this?\n Oh wait, the JS libraries you mentioned on that answers would automatically handle the hiding of scrollbars on FF too right?\n I just had a quick look at Antiscroll. When you keep scrollbars 'Always on' on Mac and try their demo on FF(http://learnboost.github.io/antiscroll/), the default Mac scrollbar appears, along with the antiscroll scrollbar fading in and out when you scroll. Compared to this, the [Nanoscroll.js demo](http://jamesflorentino.github.io/nanoScrollerJS/) handles it much better. I think we should go with Nanoscroll because of this. I'll test it out as well to ensure that content does not get distorted.\n Hey,\n\nSo I integrated nanoscroller into Codecombat and tested it on chrome and firefox and safari, and everything seems to work fine. I haven't been able to figure out how to get the ace scrollbar to hide yet, because it has a weird way of rendering scrolling. It would probably require customising the library functions itself, and I wasn't sure if I should go ahead with that. Anyway, here are some screenshots of the rest of the scrollbars. Let me know what you think-\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-02 at 11 14 44 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2319795/2595434/a86564a8-ba9a-11e3-828a-61e6a42af7fa.png)\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-02 at 11 14 30 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2319795/2595437/af40c5ba-ba9a-11e3-9abc-62545149c451.png)\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-03 at 12 38 03 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2319795/2595450/b4ce4e12-ba9a-11e3-86eb-a722651e1f88.png)\n Please check out the changes.

I was actually trying to better the scroller for modals, but that seems a bit complicated. I'd like to get your inputs on that, before making any changes to it. For now, it's a normal scrollbar for modals\n  As discussed on https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/506:\n- Timeline is visibly and functionally disabled\n- Play/Pause button is not hidden, but disabled\n  This is disabled by Apple as a security issue as mentioned [here](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/01/using-the-fullscreen-api-in-web-browsers/). What we can do is check if the browser is Safari and probably inform the user that full screen won't allow keyboard inputs. Or hide the fullscreen option in case of Safari. What do you think?\n I'm unable to reproduce this. I'm on OS X Mavericks too.\n Are you sure? I tried this on Safari and I cannot type anything on full screen mode(Not referring to the native full screen Mac option but the full screen option given within the game). It shouldn't be working in Safari really.\n Oh okay. My mistake. \nIt doesn't work.\nI think hiding the fullscreen button in Safari would be the right solution.\n    As a single page application, CodeCombat has to be careful to tear everything down properly. [.on](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-on) and [.once](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-once) are a nuisance in this regard, because you have to remember to tear them down with [.off](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-off), and if you don't you get errors and memory leaks.\n\nBetter would be to use [.listenTo](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-listenTo) and [.listenToOnce](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-listenToOnce), since the function [.stopListening](http://backbonejs.org/#Events-stopListening) will tear down all those callbacks in one call. And it's already being called in the superclasses CocoClass, CocoModel and CocoView, so the teardown would be automatic.\n\nLook for instances throughout /app of .on and .once being called. Replace them with listenTo and listenToOnce respectively. Look for teardown that is no longer needed, or needs to be migrated if teardown happens before destroy is called.\n\nExample: [profile_view.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/5852b87aa3c63299c4eb664e05f4785fb1fbdbc7/app/views/account/profile_view.coffee) has:\n\n```\n@user.on('change', @userChanged)\n@user.on('error', @userError)\n```\n\nReplace these with\n\n```\n@listenTo(@user, 'change', @userChanged)\n@listenTo(@user, 'error', @userError)\n```\n\nThis is also a good time to look for cases where fat arrows (=>) are not needed. Again in profile_view.coffee, userChanged and userError don't need to be fat arrows because .listenTo will automatically bind the callback to the instance.\n\nThe profile view is an example where teardown was forgotten, so there's none to be removed or migrated :)\n\nBe sure what callbacks you migrate are Backbone callbacks. Libraries like EaselJS and Firebase have their own callback functions which should be left as they are.\n Mostly done now, great work Shrihari! Only remaining ones that I see:\n- LevelLoader\n- CocoModel\n- Supermodel\n- WizardSettingsView\n- ThangComponentEditView\n- ColorsTabView\n- ThangTypeEditView\n- VictoryModal\n\nAll the rest that I see are for different event systems.\n #692 did some more. Just a few remaining: \n- CocoModel\n- ThangComponentEditView\n- ThangTypeEditView\n  I want to have this feature myself, so I'm looking into it now.\n Okay so it should differ from the tomb view design then? \n/edit: Ah apparently all the tooltips are \"normal\" tooltips there. \n Implemented it with the bootstrap tooltips now - however there is one major issue: they don't follow the mouse but instead are always centered. While this is okay over a button, it just looks strange on the scrub bar. I'm trying to patch it without actually patching the js now. Let's see if this works.\n  Wooop I love charts.\n\nI did a website last year with fancy javascript charts. What's most important to you though is fancy interactivity. I used amCharts but since that's not open source, no game.\n\nIf you leave out all those Raphael based libraries, it leaves you with Highcharts and Flotcharts. I have developed with neither but I checked out their demos and the former has this sleek interactive feel to it, whereas Flotcharts feels a bit clumsy. The licenses are OK so that's no problem.\n\nI propose refactoring what we currently have with Highcharts, then we can continue with #668. I'm ready to jump on it, so do I have a green light?\n I agree Highcharts feels good, but I'd be more in favor of one that doesn't require a license. [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) is used by GitHub, and looks full featured, or better yet might be one with a smaller footprint (d3 and Highcharts are about 150k each). Smaller options include [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/), [dc.js](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js) and [morris.js](http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/). What do you think of using one of those?\n\nTo be completely weaned from Google's charts, we also need some way to produce image charts on the server to send out in emails.\n I checked Highcharts more thoroughly and it looks like CodeCombat might be in trouble with its production branch. That said, I checked on Chart.js more thoroughly (came by it during my searches), and it provides no interactivity whatsoever. Other research provided nothing as good-looking.\n\nI'll look further into d3, but I'm new to it so it'll be slow going. It looks like it can handle a lot but that'll be the downside as well.\n\nConcerning server-sided charts, I'm be sure we'll find a way through Node to generate charts on the server and on demand, meaning whenever an email gets sent. I've read that this is easier to do with HTML Canvas instead of SVG charting libraries though.\n  Could you clarify a bit on the '_paging through the leaderboards_' part?\nDo you mean that a certain point on your graph relates to a certain match?\n\nThe closest I can imagine to your meaning is that when you scroll through your previous matches the graph follows along with a cursor on how you were doing at that moment.\n Yeah this needs more detail. Here's what we're thinking:\n\n![histogram](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/204723/2500595/ef7f7696-b363-11e3-9a38-6fabe0ab4348.png)\n\nAbove the table is a histogram of the scores. Where you click on its x axis determines which scores are shown. So if I click on the far left, the table below shows the bottom scores, click on the far right and you get the top scores. Have a line show you where you clicked (shown here in red), and a shaded area around it showing you the range of scores you're currently looking at (shown here in blue). Click and drag to move through the scoreboard. There would also be a button somewhere to take you to where your score is on the leaderboard. It would show the top by default. There also needs to be a state where the table is loading, and the shaded area is not showing yet.\n\nCouple other things:\n- We need something server side to cache/denormalize the data. We shouldn't reproduce the histogram each time it's called for with a query to fetch the entire leaderboard, but it should update regularly.\n- The calls to the server to get segments of the leaderboard are currently really fast, but we should debounce/throttle fetches, so the client isn't making tons and tons of calls if a user is dragging the line around.\n Alright I'm with you on how you want the user to experience the charts. Loving the drawing by the way. I'm still relatively new to the database but there should also be enough to reproduce for this and I think anyone could lay their hands on it.\n\nI'm currently still looking into an appropriate charting library. That should handle most. I really like the shaded area part.\n\nMost important though, is there already such a leaderboard? I couldn't find one anywhere.\n The leaderboard this is for is the multiplayer leaderboard. So like [dungeon arena](codecombat.com/play/ladder/dungeon-arena), instead of showing the top scores and then the ones around your current score, this whole interface would replace that.\n @schmatz I was still on d3 but I won't be able to compete wit your speed. Also, looks like you have Every bit of the setup figured out already. Looks great! Enjoy :)\n  If you have code that goes is large enough to scroll, and you move the debugger slider around, the code area scrolls to the top. Instead it should scroll to whatever line the debugger is currently highlighting.\n\nhttp://discourse.codecombat.com/t/cant-use-debug-feature/559\n This sounds rather simple. I'll look into it.\n    Currently when simulating text reads:\n\"Simulating game between and Nick00 Melee Rush and dpen2000...\"\nThis fixes it to read:\n\"Simulating game between Nick00 Melee Rush and dpen2000...\"\n  While placing a thang over indoor floor, some region of indoor floor doesn't act like a floor and because of this thang is placed below the floor which is not inteded.\nThere is some bug in implementation of indoor floor, this bug is also observed in gameplay of levels which are under development.\n    Fix for #558. In my comment, I was checking for brawlwood or dungeon arena to reload only team spells, but it would be better if it only reloaded team spells in every level anyway.\n  I will take a look at this. \n The problem was, that the wizard name in the model is set in \"onNameChange\", but backbone reset the model on a save-error apparently. The next time you press the button,  you save the original name. This works of course and the modal disappears. Fixing now.\n Seems like now the button sometimes has to be clicked twice...\n  I ran into this issue yesterday, here's my complete code: https://gist.github.com/nerdbeere/5475e298536b03e67282\n\nI also built a simple piece of code with the exact same error:\n\n```\nfunction Foo(arr) {\n    this.arr = arr;\n    this.bar();\n}\n\nFoo.prototype.bar = function() {\n    return this.arr[0];\n};\n\nnew Foo([1, 2, 3]);\n```\n Should be fixed with @basicer's new Esper interpreter.\n  Ok, I tried to translate in italian some lines ;) hope this helps.\n Hi Nick,\nI'll do that tomorrow morning ;) what about the other lines with #? Can I translate them Too?\n\n----- Messaggio originale -----\nDa: \"Nick Winter\" notifications@github.com\nInviato: \u200e22/\u200e03/\u200e2014 15.37\nA: \"codecombat/codecombat\" codecombat@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"3rr3s3v3n\" android3rr3@gmail.com\nOggetto: Re: [codecombat] Translating Multiplayer lines (#653)\n\nThanks @3rr3s3v3n!

This can and does yield an entirely different battle, sometimes changing the outcome as well.\n\nIdeally, the player would see the battle as it happened, either because all parameters, including the code, are carefully snapshotted at that moment (directly to GitHub?  How cool would that be?), or because the simulation is recorded and played back.\n\nThis is both more fun (see historical battles!) and more useful (I can carefully study why I lost, even if my opponent changes and breaks their code in the mean-time.)\n Yes. consistency definately needs some work. I don't feel confident that what I see is what the system calculated. (losses that when clicked on show the opponent with broken code x under them)\n  The issue here was configSchema is an attribute within attributes and so revertAttributes and attributes get the same instance of it when clone is used. Later calls to _.equals fail when only configSchema has changed.\n This fixes the issue but I imagine this fix will result in a lot more deepClones happening everywhere. I don't know whether this will be an issue.\n  ...language.\n I feel weird about submitting this, it's just one line\n  Hope this is okay\n  I have realized that I just don't know which levels are mine and which are others. Some way to distinguish them would be fantastic.\n\nI had thought about having something like \"My Levels\" and a \"Public\" tab. Also, another way without creating more templates would be by adding an ownership information in the row.\n Fixed also in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/commit/54207f0f7ddee00f4b4000c6413cdc4407d1ec32.\n  This works but:\n1. Currently defaults for this are set in client https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/cast_button_view.coffee#L37-40. Should this continue to be the case? Or should a default be set in the schema?\n2. Should I be handling the possibility of the save calling failing in some way? I've seen this elsewhere, just not sure what the appropriate action would be here.\n These changes are in commit now.\n  ![selection_001](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6885216/2487282/310e913e-b132-11e3-8a4f-264190d7de3f.png)\nIs there a reason why there is a second scrollbar on the right side of the home page? One is from the Firefox and the other is actually on the page.\n The issue was appearing in Chrome too when I explicitly kept scrollbars on always(in OSX). Fixed the issue.\n Made some changes. That should fix it.\n I just checked it, the scrollbars are still there for both Chrome and Firefox. I also have Ubuntu, could that change things?\n Did you checkout the pull request itself or are you talking about the live version? The live version does not have the changes because the pull request still hasn't been merged.(there are some more changes to be made as discussed in the comments on that pull request)\n Yeah I was talking about the live version. Just let me know when the live version is ready so I can close this.\n Updated my pull request\n I like it, it looks a lot better with this scrollbar.\n  I keep finding myself wondering which \"strategy\" my scripts ran against an opponent while viewing the results of the matches.\n\nDo you think it would be useful if we could see a SHORT custom message in the MyMatches table?  Perhaps it could be the last home this.say or a new method? this.inscribe... etc\n\nThis would also be nicer on the server as it would lesson the amount of battles I need to open just to see what strategy is failing.\n Another possible solution: allow multiple submissions per player. Then name the sessions. It would require more work, but it's probably something we want in the future. Then you can compete not only with others but between various strategies.\n  Some new additions and minor fixes to old ones\n glad to help :smile: \n  Not really awesome.. But only some needed information in the translation. \n Hi Nick!,\n\nYes. Bahasa Malaysia should be just \"ms\". I believe another \"similar\" \nbut different language is Bahasa Indonesia has a different variety which \nhas a different BCP47 code (instead of using a variety sub-code).\n\nhttp://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry\n\nPS, just to share - The Malay language used by Malays in Singapore and Malaysia is based \n(thus also being identical with) on the Malaysian official (not \n\"accents\" in many regions in Malaysia - like english in UK and also in \nSingapore) Malay language - including the official Malay dictionary \n(which is authored by the Malaysian University) and thus, \"ms\" is correct for official Malay or \"Bahasa Malaysia\". ;)\n\nCheers,\nMuhammad Nuzaihan\n\nOn 21/03/2014 11:26, Nick Winter wrote:\n\n> Thanks @muhammadn https://github.com/muhammadn!

Signed. :)\n\nBy the way, don't you think it is better for the CLA to live in a markdown file rather than inlined into the jade file?\n Yes, I agree that there is no advantage in converting it.\n\nI always use the `:markdown` filter or a separate file when there is a lot of text. Bulk of it (L8-75) is just simple text, so it stood out while reading. If it is okay, I'd like to move it to a `:markdown` block instead.\n  Replace all the 'fight' links directly to players with modal popups that that sets the stage for the battle to come. We have to be clear who you're playing and who's got which team. This can also be a time to show some information about the person the player is challenging.\n\nHere's one possible layout: colorized wizard on either side, each with a handful of units for their team, facing off against one another, and text underneath like <player 1>'s humans vs <player 2>'s ogres. And a big button at the bottom that says 'fight!'. Other elements you might include:\n- scores for either team\n- rank history graph for the player\n\nSee the [existing play modal](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/ladder/play_modal.coffee) for logic on things like loading player names and wizard configs, rendering sprites.\n\nOnce the modal is created, remove all 'fight' links and instead have the names of the players in the ladder view be links which open this modal for that session.\n    When a extant component is selected, all its dependents are highlighted by different color. If it's deleted, the dependents are also deleted.\nFixes #507\n  I'll look into doing this\n Yeah I'll get on to this.\n  Line 20 has been added and Line 24 is modified.\n\nBefore:\n![overlap](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6987538/2474344/7eb35566-b04a-11e3-86bf-e9480f0d21e9.png)\n\nAfter:\n![overlapfix](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6987538/2474348/853bf3fc-b04a-11e3-910e-d0ba3d3a73e3.png)\n Done with the changes that you had mentioned.\n\nThangEditor after changes:\n![thangeditorafter](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6987538/2474938/35362bdc-b051-11e3-8b92-0d40f0257c8d.png)\n\nThang in Level Editor now:\n![leveleditorafter](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6987538/2474961/7581a8d8-b051-11e3-86ff-c4b57d0b9fc1.png)\n But it looks good.\n I have signed the CodeCombat contributor license agreement\n  I was viewing the arrow components in the Thang Editor and saw this issue.\n![overlap](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6987538/2473530/1e6412c0-b042-11e3-9e5f-65e1145698be.png)\n  Format was a little annoying \n\nBefore: \nDefeat theogres\nAfter: \nDefeat the Ogres\n![screenshot 2014-03-20 13 13 05](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/569929/2472144/be464f44-b031-11e3-852a-6eae4ab04fa1.png)\n![screenshot 2014-03-20 13 15 23](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/569929/2472145/be5d57e8-b031-11e3-8b55-0892df955304.png)\n  ukrainian localization. spelling fixes, new translation\n  There are two issues when I try to sign up for a new account via email:\n- I'm unable to sign up with any email, I tested with random emails and all of them give the following error message.

Anyway, Nick could you remove those commits? sorry again.\n Hey @walkingtospace, just some quick tips following what I told you in the HipChat channel.\nCommits you push to the same branch will end up in that branch and as a result in the pull request as long as it hasn't been merged. The advantage of this is that you can add fixes to a pull request if those are needed or even remove commits and push those removals to that branch. \nAll this allows you to modify your pull request instead of opening a new one. The downside is however that you need to work on a separate branch if you're working on a second pull request at the same time. Quick tip though: don't forget to branch your new branch off of your master so you don't accidentally include changes from pull request A in pull request B, like I've done at least twice.\n I will check and change these files ASAP.\n Just note I had changed victory.jade, so just make sure your local repo is synced\n I done. Can I close this request and make pull request again?\n  Added korean locale\n  Fixed some translations and added some new translations.\n :) Thanks :)  Yes, I will read it tomorrow and then I will sign it... :) Bye..\n  I'm sure @nick knows this and is busy working at it, but I find it quite awesome that Quasar just blows up my towers and my men and my base by \"magic\". I wonder if he/she found the exploit from looking at the source, or just came up with it while coding in the editor. I think it deserves a blog post.\n\nPS, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, look at a match on brawlwood where you lose against Quasar (1st place). He doesn't even touch your guys, he just blows up your stuff at will. Hopefully it won't be too hard to patch it up though...\n\n![quasar](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2770322/2430352/8dcce3fe-acd6-11e3-9afc-dcfaa6ce0064.jpg)\n I tried my hand at this as well and found that it was ridiculously easy to do so. The problem is that the player has access to a lot more attributes than is shown, literally every attribute the Thang possesses. Encapsulation works perfectly fine though, so variables that can't be accessed through _this_ look safe. \n\nI suggest having an object inside a Thang that represents user-accessible behavior and let the user's _this_ point to that instead. This would allow you to reuse the encapsulation mechanism already in place, if it would be compatible with doing so.\n  Few translated strings\n  - The Radii shows for the selected unit\n- Which radii to be visible can be configured in hudProperties or programmableProperties or moreProgrammableProperties\n @nwinter What do you think about `buildRadius()`. I'm sure the part between line 135 and 165 can be simplified. Any suggestions?\n The latter. How would you go about making it work with any number of radii?\nOne idea I can think of is to create an array of `*radius` from `@sprite.marks` and sort them to find the radius of the hollow part.\n  Translated new tags\n  1. On the thang tab in the level editor, panning to the thang clicked in the thang list on the left makes the editor easier to use. It works fine, but I'm not sure about the way I've implemented it, code-quality wise\n2. Previously, clicking a non-selectable element (like Grass) on the left thang list would select the element, enabling it to be dragged and repositioned. Fixed this.\n3. Moving the wizard around with arrow keys allows the player to move the wizard out of the level, which is quite counter-intuitive. Added checks for that.\n Hmm. How about shift-click to select floors and other such non-selectables, and then normal dragging for repositioning them?\n Just found an issue with my git history. I'll push again, and make a separate pull request.\n\nAnd about moving floors, shift-click doesn't seem too intuitive to me, on second thought.\nI'll just remove that commit for now. If we come up with a better alternative, I'll implement it.\n  It should retain the opponent's code, and only remove the player's code.\n Hey\n\nSo, what I was trying to do was get the teams data from ladder/utils:teamDataFromLevel within reloadAllCode in tome_view and set reloadCode as false when spell.team matches the team id. However, I get a 'cannot get config of undefined' error at line 5 of ladder/utils. I'm not sure what is wrong here- can you help?\n\nBelow is the code for reloadAllCode-\n\n```\n@levelID = @options.levelID\n if @levelID is 'brawlwood'\n      @level = new Level(_id:@levelID)\n      @teams = teamDataFromLevel @level\n      spell.view.reloadCode false for spellKey, spell of @spells when spell.team is @teams[0].id\n      Backbone.Mediator.publish 'tome:cast-spells', spells: @spells\n else\n      spell.view.reloadCode false for spellKey, spell of @spells\n      Backbone.Mediator.publish 'tome:cast-spells', spells: @spells\n```\n The spells have no issue- we can directly use the team data contained in each spell. What remains is finding the team of the current user and then only reloading spells of his team. This data is in LevelView, which fetches it from `teamDataFromLevel`. I was wondering if the team data is passed in the options parameter. We could fetch this directly from there then. I couldn't find this though.\n Oops. Sorry. Really stupid of me. :/\n   123,128 additions is quite prestigious, but maybe you've added some commits you don't want to? The \"add coco\"'s seem big.\n omg. I made mistake. sorry.\n Done. I will be more careful from the next time thx.\n  Trying to play levels -- no sound is made\nChromium 27 plays the sounds just fine\n Yup, that's true\n I'm using Firefox on Ubuntu, and i tested a few levels and they work just fine. Remember that not all levels have music, like \nhttp://codecombat.com/play/level/sword-loop#  \ndoesn't, but the sound effects still work. Things like the sound of swordfighting and the victory tune all play.\n\nSomehow my music was toggled off when i looked into this. I probably did that earlier (and i forgot i did) or it was a bug, but i haven't managed to reproduce this issue.\n @Fry-kun Do you still see this bug?\n Yes, I still encounter the bug\nexample: http://codecombat.com/play/level/rescue-mission loading screen plays a sound in chrome, but nothing in firefox\n no kidding :)\nThough TBH I like not having the sound forced on me...\n Well Firefox is known for bugs related to HTML5, and audio is a common problem in HTML5. When reporting these bugs, please give your software and hardware specs, so that it can get investigated more seriously. Perhaps it's even a bug that we should report to Mozilla, but for now we are in the dark. So Please hulp us out on the information side @Fry-kun !\n Firefox 28, XFCE 4.10.1, X.Org 1.14.4, kernel 3.13.7-200.fc20.x86_64 on Fedora 20 (all from official Fedora repos)\n\n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller [8086:1c20](rev 05)\n\nLet me know what other information you want, I can get you whatever you need\n I reproduced the environment you described, except for the hardware, and sound is working for me.\n\nCan you check again? The issue is likely either fixed by now or local to your system.\n Yes, seems to work now\n  When:\n- playing dungeon arena\n- selecting a hero\n- the level is playing (not paused)\n- cast a spell\n\nI get this error:\n\n![screen shot 2014-03-14 at 4 41 46 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/204723/2427005/568e0710-abd2-11e3-9c9d-f369d2cf4c52.png)\n\nI think it's from change e2d2e96, because I inspect the mark that's throwing this error and it's pointing to a destroyed sprite (presumably because the unit DNE at the beginning of the world?), and there was this addition to the code:\n\n```\nsprite.thang = thang  # Keep around so that we know which thang the destroyed thang was for\n```\n\nNot sure what bugs you were fixing, but figured I'd hand this to you so I wouldn't unfix those.\n  I tried to log in but got some monstrous error from CloudFlare. Could not reproduce but I think it was a 520 because that's what I got in a different browser when trying to request versions. Different issue altogether.\n\n![](http://puu.sh/7vo8f.png)\n\nThe output you see is the CloudFlare error page's raw HTML. This should be captured and changed to some clean output like \"Unknown error occurred, please try again later\" or whatever it currently shows for weird errors.\n Could we still have this issue open please? You've successfully rid us of the 520 but I feel the error capturing could still use some work. The end user has no use for the gigantic wall of HTML and the developer will check their console either way so we might as well catch and prettify really unexpected errors like this one. There's no guarantee it won't happen again and we might as well be prepared.\n We don't use CloudFlare anymore.\n  1. Dragging now works for editor\n2. Fixes a panning bug with mouse scroll\n  I will try do this if nobody is working on\n done.\n  ### New functionality:\n- Set your favorite key bindings (currently supported: Vim, Emacs)\n- Display Indentation Guides\n- Display Invisibles (based on current color scheme hard to see -> needs to be fixed later)\n  Check line 234\nAlso need alternative for the word \"ladder\" in this context, there is translation that makes sense(will try to see how other games translate it and come back)\n  Fixes:\n- Higher contrast between currently executing line and background\n- No more overrides of warning, error, info gutter symbols by executed\n\nNew:\n- Hold shift and click on a part of the map to choose the coordinate that should be pasted. It will paste the coordinates as a JSON ready to be used in `this.move()`. \n\nTo-Be-Done:\n- Change cursor logo. Currently it is using the standard crosshair but it would be cooler to have a custom flag-sprite.\n  I'm on it.\n I've tried out both libraries.  I prefer Antiscroll because there is less overhead.  I'll put up a pull request by tomorrow night at the latest.\n Has there been a pull request for this issue or is this still open?\n There has already been one merge. I'm working out the bugs\nOn Mar 24, 2014 9:10 PM, \"visheshkandhari\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Has there been a pull request for this issue or is this still open?\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/540#issuecomment-38520939\n> .\n  Corrected the grammar errors, spelling error and typos in the few parts that were already translated and then translated the whole rest.\n Thank you :) Signed the CLA, added myself as a Diplomat.\n\nYour project seems really cool so I'm planning on making some commits to the code as well, just need a few days to familiarize myself with how the code is organized.\n  Looks like the sort mechanism was removed in d4abad8. I'm guessing for performance reasons. But that breaks this modal: the point is to grab sessions at certain score values and play against them. @schmatz is there some performant way we can do this query? Or is there another reason the sort was removed?\n\nWe'll also eventually need it for pagination, or viewing a specific segment of the ladder (like the part of the ladder a user is on).\n @schmatz I did some testing and it looks like it's not at all performant, it's scanning 200k of the sessions (the ones with a totalScore, looks like). We need some indexing up in there. Could you handle this, since it requires some work with the replica sets?\n1. Create an index which is keyed off level.original, level.majorVersion, team and totalScore, where totalScore is last. It should be sparse (so only sessions where totalScore exists are indexed).\n2. Change this query to not include submitted:true. With the sparse index it should only include those sessions that have a totalScore. Might need to run a command to remove totalScore from sessions where submitted is false or dne, and double check the logic does not set totalScore unless submitted (would we need submitted then, if totalScore is set iff it's submitted?).\n\nCould probably skip step two for the short term and continue using submitted, though the index will be much larger than it needs to be if it's not sparse. What do you think, worth worrying about, or an insignificant/premature optimization? Alternatively could make sure submitted is either true or dne so that the index is still not unduly large.\n Well, this is the sample query I was testing performance on:\n\n`{\n    \"level\" : {\n        \"original\" : \"53173f76c269d400000543c2\",\n        \"majorVersion\" : 0\n    },\n    \"team\" : \"humans\",\n    \"totalScore\" : {\n        \"$lte\" : 1000000\n    }\n}`\n\nBut you'd also need to include submitted: true if that's staying in for now.\n\nIncidentally, do we need a separate system for making sure these indexes stay around? I vaguely thought I'd added this when I first set up the handler, but it's nowhere to be found now. Not sure if I'm misremembering or if it didn't come along with one db migration or other. Maybe a universal place for all the indexes to live would be good.\n  1. Changes easing function for panning\n2. Changes some margins and padding for footer\n3. Adds proper toggling for active button on thangs tab for editor, and title for the buttons.\n Glad I could help.\n  Added a utility function in lib/utils, named 'i18n'. The signature is quite simple:\n`i18n = (say, target, language=me.lang(), fallback='en')`\n\nThis now gets used twice in the existing code, like so:\n`text = util.i18n(sprite.say, 'text')`\n\nAdvantages, as per issue #15:\n- Falls back from specific to general locale, e.g. 'es-ES' -> 'es'\n- Falls back to a default language or, if not available, a target object (like _blurb_) or if not available, a _text_ object\n- Falls forward to a more specific locale if the general would not be available for some reason, e.g. 'es' -> 'es-ES'\n\nBecause loading a game takes too long to actually test something decently I wrote some Jasmine tests in test/app/utils.spec.coffee. All pass.\n  Added i18n tags to all templates related to Ladder views. These have been added to the English locale and translated by me and my good friend Anton to NL (Dutch).\n\nConcerning the strange commits in this pull request: Somehow my commits keep getting lost across branches. The first two commits are the mistakes and the last one is simply an undo of their additions, which was the easiest way I found to fix it in an acceptable manner.\n\nDiplomats needed for other languages! Additions have been made to the 'general' section, as well as a new section called 'ladder'.\n  the no. of levels on the main page do not increase/change and the new levels that are added are not displayed on the site.\nOnly a certain no. of levels can be displayed on the levels page.\n If nobody called dibs yet on it I could look into it and put it on the list of weekend projects.\n Noticed this is a dupe of #111\n  One of our users wrote in a few days ago: \"In the multiplayer brawlwood beta I can't get through the game against the simple AI without crashing.

I've also recently read about advanced AI from DeepMind where they taught the computer to play arbitrary Atari games with the only feedback to the algorithm being the final score.\n\nI was thinking that it would be great if I could run 10,000 simulations in a few minutes (eventually seconds) , which I believe is quite possible from a simulation complexity standpoint.  \n\nWhat I am proposing is an \"offline simulation api\".  In phase one, this would be just running the simulation in your browser, but locally, cutting out all the network part.  Phase  2 would be some kind of a c++ module where the simulation is exported in a data format that could be simulated in c++, and phase 3 would be a GPU implementation.   \n\nAnother direction that perhaps would be more in keeping with the spirit of the project is to implement the simulation in the browser but with GPU acceleration using shaders.  I don't know the feasibility of that though.\n\nBut again, just simply being able to download some AI's, and simulate it offline in javascript might allow some optimization algorithms enough data to develop some AI based on many samples.  What would it take to just run CodeCombat simulations locally?  And possibly this would require users to \"opt in\" to let their code be downloadable.\n @nwinter Thanks, I will look at the simulator.   As far as C++ and GPU, I don't know how the internals of the engine are put together, but because there are a fixed number of simulations steps (as I understand it),  and things like getdistance or findnearbyenemies always happen in 1 step, it seems theoretically possible to represent the world as a kind of a 2d bitmap with a \"shader\" per object, and run in sequence all the shaders for each of the objects, and translate the result back into world state.   However, I'll take your word for it, and focus on Javascript, and maybe the x86 larrabee style many-core  solutions will appear in the next few years.\n  When you select areas in the scripts tab (camera, our bounds), sometimes clicking and dragging a thang will move it around. Also, zooming around the map affects the camera for the thang tab surface. Backbone Mediator events are bleeding from one view to the other, basically. Figure out a way to encapsulate these mouse events so they only affect the surface they originate from.\n Is the size of level supposed to be fit in \"Starting Conditions\" window? If not so, I think current dragging behavior is good enough. If the camera doesn't move with thang, it would be annoying to edit a bigger map.\n  While modifying components, sometimes I'll save and get validation errors because the propertyDocumentation will have 'title', 'shortName' and 'shorterName' properties in them. My guess is these get in there while playing with the preview window.\n  In regards with enhancements proposal. Since I played a quite a few RPG's in my life I wrote down a few cool names out of my head. Hope it helps :)\n  Getting there...\nPlease suggest alternatives for lines 297 and 331\n  Added the logic behind GetALLToLocations and KeepALLFromLocations\n    I was out hunting Treema bugs.\nFound just the one: one shouldn't be able to switch music files from a readOnly Treema.\n\nExtra note: The Config Schema of a System as can be accessed from the Level Editor is editable while nothing else is. I wasn't sure whether this was a feature, a coding bug where readOnly wasn't set or a Treema extension bug. Could someone please get back to me on this?\n Managed to filter out the surplus commits.\n  Added an option to the Level Editor menu 'More' (formerly 'Help'), namely 'Version History'. This shows a modal with the current level's history. Some technical changes needed to be made: Modals and Versions are different views in their own rights, so I used mix-ins for both the template and the new view.\n\nI kept the old version page, accessible through URL. Maybe there are some uses for it still.\n Right, I couldn't really test the loading bar on localhost because it loaded lightning fast (old db dump) but it did show when the callback that should turn it off was disabled. Looks ready.\n A lot will become a lot simpler when directly subclassing ModalView, however this would change a lot. I'd move it to ~~views/editor~~ views/modal because it's not a proper 'kind' anymore. The urls will have to go because it'll be a modal, so no direct access to the page either. To compensate for this I'll add the modal to both Article and Thang editors as well. \nSince we're not doing mix-ins anymore I'll get rid of the mix-in templates as well and make version templates directly subclass modals.\n\nAs for the line endings, that's just plain strange. I don't even have DOS line endings but my git is configured to preserve them, so maybe they were there to begin with?\n\nSuperVersionsView isn't mine but those are two typos I completely overlooked.\n\nI like it like this and would have done this from the start if I hadn't been too afraid to change too much. I'll just keep pushing commits to this branch and check back when I feel it's healthy enough to pull in.\n Cleaned up the whole thing. Version History is now only accessible through the editors.\n  I have asked this question on chat but I din't really got an answer and since I don't see who is mentor on this project I'm posting it here in hope you guys can help me to make outstanding application. You have posted WebRTC project proposal on GSOC2014 page in which I am very interested and I am writing a proposal for it. Also you marked it as easy but I don't see all the major issues which would  make this project easy addressed. So I would love to know which solution should I endorse in my proposal. Thank you in advance.\n- 1. Issue: Which network architecture CodeCombat need/want?\n\nThere are two viable architectures of communication \u2013 fully mesh and centralized also known as MCU (multipoint control unit) architecture. \n\n\u2022 Fully mesh architecture does not require server (besides for signaling) and is optimal for low number of participants in session because session bandwidth which is required to sustain the overall session grows for each new participant. To implement this inside CodeCombat we can consider 2 open source libraries: PeerJS and EasyRTC\n\n\u2022 Centralized \u2013 multipoint control unit is a centralized server component which is responsible of decoding, mixing and encoding back to specific users inside session. All users sustain peer connection object towards the MCU and through it they send and receive media objects which are then displayed on screen. The advantage of this architecture over full mesh is that it is more viable for conference sessions with high number of participants and it can record the media objects (which is awesome for education purpose) and the flaw is that it requires the centralized server component through all the traffic goes. To implement this inside CodeCombat we can consider 2 open source MCU server\u2019s:  Licode and Jitsi Videobridge \u2013 both of those projects are very active and still heavily under development due to the unstabilized status of WebRTC standard.\n\no   Licode comes with its own client side library which is known as ErizoJS, which is true WebRTC wrapper for all browsers and its own communication with ErizoController which is part of MCU server. Also, it comes with PaaS controller called NuveJS which helps to scale the server up to multiple instances on server farm.\no   Jitsi Videobridge is viable alternative to Licode. As a client side library it is compatible with couple of softphone libraries like JSSIP, Colibri and Strophe.jingle.\n- 2. Issue: NAT traversal and enterprise firewalls?\n\nOne more problem which we have to consider is NAT traversal. A lot of computers which are connected to the internet still use IPv4 and therefore a lot of users are still behind NAT (network address translators). To cope with NAT traversal we have to use STUN/TURN/ICE technology. Best solution out there currently is rfc5766-turn-server (https://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/) which not only is TURN server itself but also has STUN support. The entire story and connectivity problem is explained here:http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/ . The installation, configuration and testing of rfc5766-turn-server could be tricky and therefore it is recommended to install it on specialized server instance and define its listening ports on 80 and 443 with valid SSL certificate. The reason for this is enterprise firewall. For example student campus network is behind 2 NAT\u2019s and enterprise firewall is blocking all outgoing ports besides 80 and 443. In this case entire student campus will not be able to use new CodeCombat RTC feature if rfc5766-turn-server is not properly configured and since codecombat.com is using those ports this server has to have its own instance and different IP address. Also, there are couple of tricks with mobile networks which require special attention in configuration. \n- 3. Issue: Quality insurance, sharing desktop, recording?\n\nDifferent libraries have different ways to ensure quality and some of the completely don\u2019t have it simple because WebRTC in a lot of cases automatically handle quality according to user network upload speed. ErizoJS and EasyRTC have good manual quality insurance which are easy configurable inside a script. In production ready WebRTC application this is still an issue because heterogeneous real world networks have very dynamic behavior when RTC applications comes to question. How important quality is for CodeCombat and is full HD or ultra HD needed?\nSharing screen is one of the additional features inside WebRTC which is still in begging stages and therefore very buggy and not viable for production use. Also it does require a valid SSL certificate and enabled flag inside Chrome to share it. This feature would be very useful for educational platform. Therefore we have to decide does CodeCombat need it?\nRecording feature is currently viable only in MCU architecture. Since all media object comes and goes through peer connection to MCU, it enables the server to save them. In current stage Licode \u2013 very good MCU server for WebRTC saves the stream to mkv format which sadly is not reproducible inside browser. For that need, after recording the transcoding phase is needed, where we use avconv or ffmpeg library to transcode the video from mkv format to webm, or some other browser friendly container.\n- 4. Issue: User partitioned chat - data channel or websocket?\n\nAs third main component of WebRTC, data channels represent a viable solution for textual chat inside a room (where room presents user partitioning per level playing or level construction session). However, a lot of libraries still use websocket on signaling or MCU server for textual chat. Now to clarify the issue here, both of the solutions are good but the question here is what CodeCombat really needs. Websocket solution with publisher/subscriber design pattern is very good way to do user partitioning and chat overall due to the caching and possibility to do push notification over the same socket, but data channels have performance advantage if fully mesh architecture is selected. Does CodeCombat need data channel textual chat or endorsing websocket solution is better?\n\nThank you for all the support in making better proposal.\n\nSincerely Sam.\n  In the beginning of the new Dungeon Arena level, the base says \"Press play to watch how the battle currently unfolds.\" While it is playing, clicking on the timeline pauses the game without showing the 'Play' button.\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/39978/2368493/bcaf7580-a7ac-11e3-859b-d880de3e4467.png)\n Yes, that would in fact make more sense. More importantly the timeline should be functionally (and maybe visibly?) disabled too.\n Which level is this?\n http://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeon-arena\n  It is because of the team color.\n Click the Colors tab in <a href=\"http://codecombat.com/editor/thang/house-1\">House 1 Thang Type</a> and see the color maybe that is creating some problem.\n Fixed this already, forgot to mark it so.\n   No problem!\n\n2014-03-09 17:09 GMT+02:00 Nick Winter notifications@github.com:\n\n> Hi @gorodsb https://github.com/gorodsb!

One can have several popovers (just shrink the window and try again). \nThe picture (notice my mouse on the surface, showing grid coordinates):\n![popover_not_hiding](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6823298/2432396/06438e0a-ad63-11e3-9c66-94e7ecfb3444.png)\nLooks like popover with spells does not die after the new world appears. As far as I understand, solution must reside somewhere in /app/views/play/level/tome/thang_list_entry_view.coffee. Popovers from the pallete itself are handled correctly.\n    It may just be that I made an account after playing the \"Rescue Mission\" Level, but when trying to go back into the level, I had to go through all the completed levels to get to where I left off.\n I just tried it, and once again it brought me to the beginning of the levels. Making me hit the \"Done\" button in each completed level. Would there be a way to check each level if it has been completed by the user and be able to skip it until it reaches a new level?\n That may be it, but the idea of saving the progress to an account makes more sense in making a more effective save point.\n  This issue seems to be fixed?\n  The castspell is defaulting in the matter of seconds, which can get annoying when trying to write more than one line on the spell. Would it be better if the default was on manual with the option of making an autocast delay?\n I believe it was the \"Rescue mission\" level, I haven't tried any other levels yet so I don't know if it's a recurring issue.\n I guess that makes sense, it just gets annoying at times when the spell is casting every time I write a line, but I understand the reasoning behind it. As for improvement, maybe if there was a warning or something to show how the spellcasting works and give them a choice to change it or leave it.\n Next idea: #1233. Will close this in favor of the more concrete idea. I also made the default manual on all non-beginner levels.\n  Steps to repeat:\n1. Load any level\n2. Write:\n\n``` JS\nif (true >== true){\n    true;}\n```\n\nor\n\n``` JS\nIf (true ==== true){\n    true;}\n```\n\n2.1. Wait for \"Spell saved\"\n3. Press F5\n4. Look at 100% building bar.\n @nwinter Now I see only \"Ready!\" on loading screen and I can not even reset code with button. \n\nReopen.\n +1, i don't see any way to reset my code, stuck at 100% ready screen.\n @nwinter Thanks!\n @nwinter what do you think about adding a separate page with the editor only, without simulation? Just for emergency purposes like this one.\n CodeCombat is great, thanks for it! Despite writing `break` in `forEach` loops i'll contribute sometime! :smiley: \n  So I noticed that in the first level, during the starting \"action cuts\", when I tried restarting the level just before Tharin says \"I hear ogre up ahead, Wizard\", the whole level gets restarted, but the screen gets stuck at a random position. This is what it looks like basically-\n\n![screen shot 2014-03-07 at 6 46 22 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2319795/2357219/e9f305e2-a5fa-11e3-8a40-173fc678989d.png)\n\nSo, as you can see, the tutorial has itself restarted, but the screen is stuck at a random position. This gets resolved if you keep pressing continue until you reach the same point from where you restarted, but it's a bug nonetheless.\n\nAnd one more minor thing- when you meet Tharin for the first time, his armour is sort of a pinkish colour, but it turns to red later. That's a little weird to watch :P\n Think this must be fixed, can't reproduce any more.\n  I have saw this multiple times on my dev server as well. If I start Firefox(24.0) fresh and launch the app, this will most likely happen, and a manual visit to `auth/whoami` or a refresh would fix it. I guess this might be browser (and platform?) specific, as it never happens on Chrome or Windows, not sure about its exact nature though.\n\nI have tried 27.0.1 with the same results, and it happens with the production site. It's curious how Firefox refused to send the `connect.sess` cookie it received from `auth/whoami`. I would say the cookie behavior is rather... random. Firefox ignores the empty session cookies from `db` 403s as well, but sends that out when one requests a level. Bizarre. There is a dirty hack to circumvent it, by inserting\n\n``` html\n<script>$.ajax(\"/auth/whoami\");</script>\n```\n\nin the `index.html` templates immediately after that `vendor.js` line, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate.\n I'm getting this from the levels page - http://codecombat.com/play\nI'm using Chrome on Ubuntu. The js console shows a 401 (Unauthorized)\nIt works fine after logging in though\n Fixed, I hope! Race conditions are a little tricky to test for...\n2861f62 \n Can we open this issue again? I can still reproduce this bug- simply open a new browser(preferably Firefox) and go directly to a level like http://www.codecombat.com/play/level/rescue-mission. Also, note that you will not get this error if you click on any level- it would load normally. After pondering over this for quite a while, I noticed that the main difference is that db/level/schema, db/thang.type/schema and db/level.session/schema are not requested when this bug occurs. Fetching anything from the db gives a 401. I tried going through all the different routes when a level would load, and my theory is that when a new Level is created, CocoModel checks if the schema is already loaded, else it requires me from lib/auth and loads schema if me is loaded.(app/models/CocoModel.coffee:25) \n\nI'm thinking there is a race condition here, in that lib/auth has still not created a new anonymous user when the schema is requested, and thus no schema is loaded, and no requests to /db/ work after this. Thoughts on this?\n I think I figured the issue. If you try to directly load a level, /lib/auth/ gets called to create a new User, but since User has an initialize function and not a constructor, it waits for the backbone structure to get created before anything else. So the user Schema is not loaded, the user is not created first, whereas levelLoader has a constructor function, and it loads the level before the user is created. Thus you get all the 401s.\n\nI think this should solve the issue. Let me know what you guys think about this.\n This explanation doesn't make sense to me. initialize.coffee waits on auth to load the user before the router gets created, so auth's init function happens strictly before LevelLoader gets going. And since User is inheriting from CocoModel which inherits from Backbone.Model, it has a constructor.\n\nWhat I think is happening is the constructor is no longer using arguments passed in. Each User created is an empty shell because the attributes and options are not passed to super. So auth always creates a new user rather than a user from localStorage, initialize sees that me does not have an id, and then waits until the user is fetched from the server before continuing.\n\nYou know what this suggests to me is that the localStorage and cookie session state are out of sync. If we _do_ have a localStorage me, but the session cookie does not work, then:\n1. auth creates user 'me'\n2. initialize thinks we're logged in, lets the page load as normal\n3. as soon as any page tries to load something from the db, it fails\n\nSo we need a solution where we don't rely on local storage to determine if we're logged in, but also ideally we don't get stopped from loading the page waiting to check with the server if we're logged in.\n  Pans sounds across -0.5 ~ 0.5 according to screen coordinates, adjusts volume according to `distanceRatio`.

Possibly related to #438\n  Hi I am very new to codecombat and this may be a foolish question.I have downloaded the master file from CC Github link and i intend to work on the Challengepost CC challenge.One thing as mention the Javascript support is there on which Folder i will likely get the JavaScript step by step parser for Mozilla Abstract Tree format in the master File and if i want to implement TypeScript Support where to start from?I am a novice programmer so please forgive me if it is a silly question.I am eager to learn and contribute\n I read up some to help you along. Let me state at first that the subject you have chosen is for advanced programmers, or at least for programmers with a decent understanding of compilers.\n\nThe Mozilla Abstract Syntax Tree is as defined in their [Parser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API). To understand this properly you should have some understanding of how compilers treat source code and the tokens parsed from it. Maybe check out a beginning tutorial on it?\n\nThe Abstract Syntax Tree should be exposed by an API for the library you'd write. I found [Acorn.js](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/acorn/) to be a pretty good example of how this would work. It should be a Javascript library.\n\nAs you can see, exposing the API probably wouldn't be too hard of a problem. The real challenge would be to create a compiler that returns the Abstract Syntax Tree as defined by Mozilla. Also i'm _guessing_ the current Javasript Abstract Tree builder is inside Aether, so you might want to check that out.\n\nIt still looks like you're not really posting an actual issue on Code Combat. You might benefit from joining the [public HipChat channel](https://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa) so you could get some quicker answers to your questions.\n  It would be AMAZING if there was a way to get code to be evaluated as CoffeeScript instead of JS. I'll try and get a PR for this if I can figure out how to do it.\n  There are actually two problems with the current password recovery: \n\n1) It gives users a 404 error if the email isn't found. We should probably style that and make it a bit more user friendly.\n2) The BIG problem: if you enter an email not in the system, the entire site becomes unresponsive, as in, you can't click any of the links/menus.\n\nThis is on Mac OSX running on Beta Chrome.\n Currently {email: userEnteredEmail} is POSTed to _/auth/reset_ which raises the 404. The actual location destination for this destination should be looked for and if it doesn't exist, created.\n Hi,\n\nThe error here is a very minor problem in the template. When a genericFailure occurs, the function in lib/errors checks whether an element with 'form' class is visible. If not, it creates a new modal where the error message is displayed. The problem exists here, because the previous modal is not being disabled. I'm not sure how we should fix this. I think we should not try creating a new modal but display it somewhere else(possibly on the modal itself, even if it doesn't have any element with a form class visible).\n\nAnyhow, the quick fix here would be to change the class name in recover.jade from '.form-inline' to '.form'. There seems no point of keeping it inline, as it is there is just one input box. That fixes the issue. It's a very minor correction, I guess someone here who can push to the main code can make this change?\n To continue on your fine elaboration @adi2412 : The previous modal was supposed to be disabled in the recover_modal view, since it's subscribed to the server-error event with onServerError. This event is published in app.js (line 3127), in the genericFailure function. The strange part is that onServerError never gets called and this is as far as I've got now, even though the event publishing is the first thing that genericFailure does.\n\nEither way I propose a more specific failure function for \"e-mail not found\", or a genericFailure one that is more customizable. \n @rubenvereecken The issue here is simple: Bootstrap modal functions breakdown the Backbone modal. Calling the modal.('hide') in showErrorModal(lib/errors.coffee), the modal gets hidden, but the modal is never disabled! I'm not really very experienced in Backbone, but if we can subscribe to an on-hide event, we could possibly create a function in the RecoverModalView to disable the modal when it gets hidden. Thoughts?\n But that on-hide function would disable the modal, just like the current onServerError does. We just need to get that last one working and we'd have achieved the same without creating an extra event.\n If we want to continue using the showErrorModal function as is, we would need to create a new event. Otherwise we would have to require all the different modals in errors.coffee which can throw errors and then disable all of them when only one of those would need to be disabled. I don't think that would be very clean.\n\nEdit: Or as the TODO says, we could work error handling into a separate forms system.\n  I tried reproducing this. \n\nIt doesn't seem to happen on my local version. \nAnd on codecombat.com, it only happens with one of my accounts, I just can't save the wizard name.\nI'm getting a 409 too for the put request.\n\nI tried creating a new account on codecombat.com, and everything seemed to work fine.\n I could reproduce this error, but when I used the same weird name twice. I think the issue is because it even checks anonymous user names and they cause a collision. We can probably delete the otherUser if anonymous is set to true, and then set the name for the current user. What do you think @nwinter?\n  Hi all, while editing a spell, onmousehover is generating help content in a box whose width is variable (difference between mouse pointer position and page width). This is making the help content look odd. Solution could be to change the css of box to have a min. width and change position of the popup box accordingly.\n  Includes some minor NL locale fixes.\n'Autosave' locale had the wrong data-i18n attribute and is now translated correctly.\nAdded locale for 'Notifications' in user settings panel.\nEditor Tables (for Articles and the like) now have i18n applied correctly (it didn't translate before).\n\nAdded locale for \"Create new Article\" and similar together with \"Search Articles Here\" for the button at http://localhost:3000/editor/article. It used to be just \"Create New #{var}\" and I tried to keep it that way, but 'Article' really needed a translation or it would look horrible. Same goes for \"Search #{var}s Here\". Adding extra locale for plurals was overkill. The easiest solution adds 6 locale strings; 3 for \"Create New. .\" and 3 for \"Search .. here\".\n   Done and done @nwinter \n  Most patches I did were simply grammar fixes or trivial typos. Some were more constructive.\nThe part someone might want to review is where I changed \"ambassador_summary\". The Dutch version was more verbose and added different semantics than the original.\n  When exactly does this crash happen?\n  Solved in #467 \n  When i change some lines on settings tab and click Save - modal form with \"Level: %name% - Not Modified\".\nIf you change something on the other tabs - saving works correctly.\n I've been trying to debug this but it's been horribly unproductive so far. Locally I get all kinds of weird things like two commit messages per modal. Moreover, I keep saving but the 'modified' dialogues keep coming. Also, concerning your bug, editing a setting correctly displayed a 'modified' dialogue where there wasn't one before.\n\nConsidering this, it would be nice to have a visible commit history. I'm not sure whether the system keeps accepting every save as a new entry or simply keeps discarding every attempt to save.\n Rename drop-down menu \"Help\" to \"More\" then add this link there.\n Beside the current issue: I made a modal version history, accessible from the level editor, that allows easy look-up. Will pull request when cleaned up.\n   I can confirm that I have the same problem on Arch Linux. However the alt - click menu does work :)\n   okay, I have signed.\n  Created a custom logger for production environments which logs all HTTP statuses other than 200 and 304.\n   1. Moved wizard movement code to WizardSprite\n2. Is it okay to add a new parameter to set whether the movement should be linear? New parameters must be added to both `setTarget(..., isLinear=false)` and `beginMoveTween: (..., isLinear=false)` to fix it this way.\n3. Wizard moves when holding the button down.\n4. There's a problem here. If I hold 2 keys, only the latest gets fired. I've added a console.log to `moveWizard` to see how it gets called. I guess this can be fixed by adding more keyboard shortcuts for diagonal movements like 'up+right', etc.\n   ![screenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/136691/2302464/10761d60-a17f-11e3-9639-1b314785391d.png)\n\n**Update:**\nIf I add more shortcuts, it fires all 3 events e.g. up+right ----fires----> u+r, u, r\n Fixed wizard movement with multiple keys. Still needs one more thing to do. When user keeps an arrow key pressed, the wizard moves a little, stops and then starts moving and then continues moving. This happens because of the way Operating Systems take keyboard input when keys are pressed.\n  The breadcrumbs are still using the default bootstrap styles, will modify the styles of the editor page(s) in a separate issue.\n\nFixes #380.\n   Should be fixed now!\n  The `modal('hide')` function does not wait until the modal is fully hidden before the Backbone's `router.navigate` is triggered. Hence there was a transparent modal backdrop `<div class=\"modal-backdrop fade in\"></div>` that remains and was covering the whole page, causing the whole page to be unresponsive.\n\nTo fix this, a event listener for the modal hidden event was added and the redirecting to the editor page only happens when the `hidden.bs.modal` event was triggered.\n\nFixes issues #438 and #439.\n  Added the name \"Cid\" under \"Soldier M\".\n  When you add a thang to a new level, the page becomes unresponsive and does not respond even on reloading.\n error in jquery.js line 7845 and line 7654\n This issue can be closed now.\n    subprocess.check_output(\"mongod --version\",shell=True) returns a byte\nstring so to convert it to a regular string we should do this :\nmongo_version_string = subprocess.check_output(\"mongod\n--version\",shell=True)\nmongo_version_string = mongo_version_string.decode(encoding='UTF-8')\n My first commit ! \n  sorted out some mixed descriptions\n  This has to do with how the variable ladderGame is set. In level_view.coffee, it checks for the existence of another session and uses this to set the boolean ladder game. This breaks if the player is playing against the default code. \n@nwinter @sderickson \n  Added more names for #53 (Think of more Thang names)\n    I noticed the available spells menu does not open by default when selecting Spanish, Portuguese, and other languages.

In this way, if a person is struck and tired of thinking, he can seek for help rather than exiting the game.\n  One of our users got in touch and was able to reproduce this bug:\n\n\"Sorry for the late reply, my OS windows 8, browser FF 27 and yes i confirm when i set it to manual sometimes it stops till i click cast by myself and sometimes it doesnt, ill try it one more time and let you if it occurs again with me.\"\n That is possible, although I suppose in that case, she didn't specify further than the included quote, so I'm not sure. Although as a user, I would expect the \"manual\" option to be universal, ie, that clicking off a unit would still not cast my spells.\n  One of our users brought up that we need a way for people to skip it. Probably doesn't need to be a big, obvious button, and might just come down to telling people they can use the \"escape\" button, but it's definitely not discoverable, and for a certain portion of our users who are showing the site to a friend, returning with forgotten credentials, etc, it's annoying to have to sit through the entire tutorial again.\n Yeah, I'm thinking we need to provide something more visible/obvious, I have gone through the tutorial several dozen times and have never seen that.\n If you look at my screenshot in https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/116, it was more obvious.\n\nPerhaps we could revert back to the more obvious placement.\n Maybe in addition to pressing shift+space five times, it has to be\nreplaying a level.\n\nOn Mon, Feb 24, 2014 at 11:21 AM, Nick Winter notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> It didn't fit in many of the cases, though.

Or perhaps in the bottom right corner of the tutorial level?\n 1. Why do \"Continue\" and \"Shift + Space\" seem to be doing different functions? \"Continue\" waits for the dialogs to complete and then lets me proceeds. But, \"Shift + Space\" skips the dialog entirely. This is a bit unintuitive compared to other games where pressing the keyboard shortcut once completes the dialog; pressing it again proceeds to the next dialog. (Example: Pok\u00e9mon)\n2. Why does the button not say \"Continue [\u21b5]\" ? For an action as simple as going to the next dialog, Enter makes more sense than Shift+Space.\n   ![screen shot 2014-03-05 at 12 13 24 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/39978/2330374/e3970d08-a431-11e3-9319-f7884b592bc6.png)\n3. Coming this specific issue, even I played through the Rescue Mission a lot of times and I never saw \"skip: esc\". Again, placing this inside the dialog box is confusing. It's not clear if it will skip the entire tutorial or just a few dialogs. \n\nA better placement would be \"Press ESC to skip tutorial\" either on the Map or the left of 'full screen, zoom, gear' icons. This text could be displayed at the beginning of the tutorial and disappear either (1) after a few seconds or (2) after the first dialog.\n\nSomething like this: http://recordit.co/OOOjOQ\n\nThis way:\n1. Everyone will see the message\n2. It will be clear that the entire tutorial will be skipped\n3. The message will not linger around on screen if the user decides to go through the tutorial\n The script system doesn't really have a way to skip an entire tutorial. Escape simply skips past all the currently queued scripts, up until it hits anything that is 'unskippable' (things we really want people to be able to read or they won't know what their next action should be). So having a separate button to skip the whole tutorial isn't really feasible, not without a rethinking of the script system, or at least some clever additions to it.\n\n@Shrihari \n1. Continue and shift+space _do_ do the same things, at least programmatically. Both tell the system to go onto the next queued piece of the script that's currently playing. It's just the continue button unhides itself only after the text has appeared. I'd be reluctant to change it to more of a pokemon style, mainly because that means more keyboard pressing to move forward, but it's something we could try.\n2. We need a shortcut that will work whether the user is focused on the editor or not. Pressing enter while you're focused on the editor should add a new line, not move the script forward. For convenience, enter when you're not focused on the editor also works to move to the next piece of a script.\n3. I agree, I haven't seen it myself and I use the site pretty regularly!\n\nI'd recommend not putting the text to skip there in the playback view. It's already getting too noisy there (we're thinking of combining some of those buttons) and it's further away from the dialog box that's the focus of the attention.\n\nI suggest putting a button next to the continue button that says \"Skip (esc)\" or \"Skip Ahead (esc)\". That fits in with what can currently be done with the script system (that is, you can't currently skip an entire tutorial), it's next to the button that people are already seeing so it would increase visibility, and it would fit since we aim to keep each block of text small enough to fit in two lines.\n We don't put the shortcut in the button anymore.\n  Translated wizard_settings and  editor page ,and fix up some Inaccurate words.\n    When can I see the results of my work? And I'd like to talk about some parts of localization in any chat after that.\n Hi @M-r-A, great work! Can you please sign the [CLA](http://www.codecombat.com) before we accept your commits? Thanks! :+1: \n @schmatz \nDone.\n  I am documenting UsesObject Component\n @nwinter I sent you the JSON content of programming.UsesObjects component to nick@codecombat.com. - Karan Dhamele\n I'm doing  Uses RegExpression.\n I am now doing Programming.Programmable because RegExp wasn't there.  @nwinter Why is that?\n I am back to RegExp Sorry\n  this should take care of issue #167 - the plugin has to be reinitialized after inserting the view, and some additional clean-up has to be done for it to work properly. I couldn't find a proper destroy method, but the author seems to be working on it (see https://github.com/octopuscreative/FancySelect/issues/25)\n\n-jose\n Thanks! I just signed the CLA. I also cleaned up the function name and moved the buildLanguages away from afterRender. I had initially left it there defensively in case we ever call render() elsewhere and forget to call buildLanguages along with it (figured having to run this twice for a new page load was a small price to pay), but I guess it'll be pretty obvious if the language button disappears altogether when someone works on this page ;)\n  I've translated a little part. And planning to translate the rest of document tomorrow. I'm not so sciential about GitHub, do I have to do anything else after I propose it?\n  Currently, if a user were to go to a link like [this](http://codecombat.com/play/level/myfakelevel) then they would get presented with a rather ugly \"Level could not be loaded\" screen. Even worse, the level name will be stored so when they press play it will link them back to this screen.  We should either validate input or give them a link to the levels page so they can choose a valid level.\n Which method is preferred? There are two ways I can go about fixing this:\n1. Redirect to `/play` when there's an error in loading levels.\n2. Go with @tips48 suggestion of giving them a link to the levels page within the `<div class=\"alert\">...</div>`.\n Alright I will tackle this issue. Currently there is a duplication of error messages show on this page: [http://codecombat.com/play/level/myfakelevel](http://codecombat.com/play/level/myfakelevel).\n\nThere are 3 places where the \"Level could not be loaded.\" text is rendered. Is it a must to render it in `spectate_view.coffee` and `level_view.coffee` also? It seems like `LevelLoader.coffee` already catches the error and renders it (the bottom div seen on that page).\n I added this line to `level_view.coffee`:\n\n```\n@$el.html('<div class=\"alert\"><h2>Whoops we were not able to find ' + @levelID + '!</h2><p>' + msg + '</p><p>Please select a valid level from the <a href=\"/play\">levels</a> page.</p></div>')\n```\n\nand the result is \n![screen shot 2014-02-26 at 3 28 13 am](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1315101/2261780/fea887d2-9e52-11e3-8025-2ae8012f1f25.png).\n\nBut it's not really right to append HTML like this. What's the recommended approach for Codecombat? Do I have to go through i18n for all messages?\n  It was stated in [this thread](http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/capture-ctrl-s-might-make-the-experience-better-for-new-players/126) that we should block Ctrl-S to make the experience better for new players.  This code does that in a way that is easy and workers across Firefox, Chrome, and IE\n  Chanched a lot of words\n  Very small change but fixes a misalignment on the social icons on the homepage.\n No worries. Was looking to start contributing and just saw a quick fix.\n\nOn Thursday, February 20, 2014, Nick Winter notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Nice, good fix.

Thanks for the contribution :+1: Before we accept it, can you please sign the [CLA](http://codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n    This is just a change to consolidate the /contribute text. The text might not be as desired, English isn't my strong suit.\n\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/313\n  I'll translate the rest soon\n ok signed :)\n  When you have finished creating a thang type, there's no way to get back to the list of thang types except by modifying the url, which is tedious.\n Is this just a button akin to the 'back' button on the browser?\n Well, the level editor has its whole own style now. The thang type editor could probably use the same style, actually, but alternatively we could just put a bootstrap breadcrumbs in there. It would navigate to home (/), editor (/editor), thang (/editor/thang) and then the thang type name itself.\n Is it ok if I restyle the tables and change the font to \"Bangers\"? The current table uses the default bootstrap styles which IMO doesn't match with the overall design of the site.\n  When you create a new thang type, the popup window for naming it should auto-focus the  input field, instead you have to click it manually.\n This issue can be closed now (:\n  Scott said this was because pagination was broken, but if you search for the \"poisoned\" thang type, it doesn't appear in the list here: http://codecombat.com/editor/thang Search is currently broken, so you can't access the thang type by searching. If you use the direct url, you can see the thang type is defined: http://codecombat.com/editor/thang/poisoned but it's not showing up on the list.\n  If you go to the Thang editor when not logged in, you are given no indication that you aren't able to edit the Thangs. Several times I've gone in, made some changes, went to save, and been asked to agree to the CLA. When I click Save, the popup simply refreshes. I then login and my changes are lost. \n\nSo we can either:\n\n1) restrict access to the Thang editor to logged in users\n2) show users a \"you need to login\" alert when trying to save stuff without a session and then actually retaining their changes _somehow_\n Users currently can't edit Thangs when not logged in, ever since I changed a bunch. Do we want to add something to that?\n  Fixed with 0fb2018\n   I signed\n  If you give built units commands from the base, they will obey in their undead form. \n  Right now, we use express.logger on the 'dev' setting, which is quite verbose. In production, we should use a more concise logging level, perhaps only errors, to save bandwidth and space.\n Hi @schmatz, I'm currently working on it, please help me with some issues.\n1. express.logger seems only log request to static files such as image and schema files. I'm not sure if it's intended to act so. I didn't see any logs from request handlers.\n2. I try to produce some errors using <pre>return @sendError(res, 500, 'Testing Error')</pre> in get method under  /server/commons/Handler.coffee, but everything still works. Am I missing something?\n\nThanks for any help.\n Hi @gintau, the express logger logs all requests in the form \"[verb] [route] [response] [time] - [size]. The logs in the actual handlers are logged with the winston package.\n1. What error were you expecting in this situation? That line of code will produce a successful response.\n\nThanks for working on this!\n I have located the loggers code. What I was trying to do is produce some errors to see if production logger only logs error case (4XX, 5XX status code). So far I can only see request logsfor resource files (image, schema)  in console, both successful and erroneous requests to Handler are not caught.\n\n<pre>return @sendError(res, 500, 'Testing Error')</pre>In your comment, this line does not send error. I wonder what's this function for? I admit I haven't dig into the detail, but in most cases, controller sends 500 for any uncaught exception at server.\n Looks like something from here will help...\n\nhttp://docs.nodejitsu.com/articles/intermediate/how-to-log\n I've created a custom logger for production which logs all HTTP statuses other than 200 and 304. The format is similar to the one used by the 'dev' logger. If this is fine, let me know what further changes should be made to the format or any other things.\n  When the thang editor page first loads on my browser (Chrome/Mac OSX), nothing is clickable/linked. If I refresh the page, everything starts working.\n This is also true on Windows 7/Chrome.\n  For instance, if you are editing the code for Ivy, an archer, it will save in the code under the code for Ivy instead of programmable archer. This has no ill effects except increasing the size of the session documents.\n  Hey, I'm a new member looking to be an Archmage and this looks like a fun project. Is anyone  already working on this? \n Update: Unfortunately my school life has suddenly gotten very busy so I won't be able to contribute very much. I'm currently working off this example: http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2011/03/21/javascript-quadtree-implementation/\n I'll look into this issue this weekend and see what I can do. Already heard couple of times about quadtrees, though never actually had a chance to implement it.\n That's what I've worked out about quadtree:\n1) Quadtree is a tree, where every node has exactly 0 or 4 children. Each node corresponds to rectangular part of some plane (root = the whole plane). Children have roughly 1/4 of father's part.\n2) Data points are stored (in most cases) in leaf nodes. There is a treshold - how many points a node can store. If the number of points exceeds it, we divide the node into 4 parts and transfer it's points to children.\n3) We can store AABB's inside the tree. It's mostly the same, but if some AABB does not completely fall to some node's child rectangle, then it is stored in that node (the only case when we store data in internal nodes).\n4) We can perform a rectangular query on quadtree, which will give us all rectangles that may intersect with our's (~they lie in one node, though that's not very accurate).\n5) If objects are moving, we must delete and reinsert them from a quadtree (if we don't want to just rebuild the whole tree every frame).\n\nI've read 3 implementations and got the drift, going to write some code!\nUPD: this could take a while, since I'm studying hard at university atm.\n @nwinter  Currently I have only a concept of how I want to implement it, but later I'll do that on GitHub.\n Here are some steps I'd take when doing this one:\n1. Get the [dev environment set up](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup:-General-Information). Make sure to [download the database dump](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Dev-Setup:-Linux#installing-the-database).\n2. Add a placeholder `quadtree.coffee` class in `app/lib/world`. You can look at [Vector.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/vector.coffee) for an idea of how to format it.\n3. In the level editor for, say, [Sarven Treasure](http://localhost:3000/editor/level/sarven-treasure), open the Inventory System and try to require the QuadTree class to make sure that your import is set up correctly.\n4. Implement the APIs you need to interface between the QuadTree and the Systems' [registries](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/system.coffee#L26-L44), but just using a simple array to start off. Make it so there are two types of registries: normal arrays, and also quadtree registries.\n5. Make sure existing levels still work: collectors can collect coins and hearers can hear sayers.\n6. Create a test level where it takes a lot of CPU to determine what Collects Thangs are collecting what Collectable Thangs (so tons of coins, tons of Collectors).\n7. Record performance stats for the test level in a controlled run.\n8. Implement the QuadTree APIs to make it so that it's not an O(n \\* m) operation.\n9. Make sure the results of the test level are the same.\n10. Record performance stats for the test level now using quadtrees.\n11. Use the Chrome profiler on the web worker thread when running the level to see where the code is still slow, and optimize it.\n12. Record final performance stats.\n13. If time, refactor some of the Vision and Combat System checks to also use the new quadtree registries.\n  Probably should modify saveChangesToDocument in /server/commons/Handler.coffee to go through editable properties and see if any of them were removed, and remove them from the model if so.\n  Executing setup.py with the latest version of python throws numerous errors due to the deprecation of print statement and changes to the os and urllib modules, among others. \n Hi @LightAndLight,\n\nI actually wrote most of the those setup scripts in Python 3 before I realized that Python 2.7.x comes installed by default on most machines. Thus a decision was made to support Python 2.7 over 3. If it was easy to rewrite the module in such a way that it became source compatible with both 2.7 and 3, that would be a fantastic contribution.\n @schmatz I'll get working on it\n Thanks again @LightAndLight!\n If mongo_version_string you should be able to search lists using \"in\" but I'll have to test later. Sorry for the inconvenience. \n subprocess.check_output(\"mongod --version\",shell=True) returns a byte string so to convert it to a regular string we should do this : \nmongo_version_string = subprocess.check_output(\"mongod --version\",shell=True)\n        mongo_version_string = mongo_version_string.decode(encoding='UTF-8')\n  - Goto http://www.codecombat.com/\n- Push login Button\n- Push \"G+ SignIn\" button\n\nPop-Up opens with an error:\n\nError: origin_mismatch\nRequest Details\nscope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.moments.write https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.profile.agerange.read https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.profile.language.read https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.circles.members.read\nredirect_uri=postmessage\nstate=585454180|0.1584376207\norigin=http://www.codecombat.com\ndisplay=page\ncookie_policy_enforce=false\nresponse_type=code token id_token gsession\naccess_type=online\ncookie_policy=single_host_origin\nproxy=oauth2relay749975686\ninclude_granted_scopes=true\nclient_id=800329290710-j9sivplv2gpcdgkrsis9rff3o417mlfa.apps.googleusercontent.com\nauthuser=0\n Does this still occur?

But it stopped working for me recently because I'd hit the localStorage limit. Document backups had been piling up and not cleaned up. Clearing localStorage fixed it for me, but would be better to have a more long term solution. Here are some ideas:\n1. Auto-remove documents that are stale. Have some time-keeping for which backups have been updated when and when there are a certain number of backups in localStorage, start deleting the old ones.\n2. Have a handler warn when localStorage is getting full, encouraging the user to choose which documents get the boot.\n3. Use diffpatch to store much smaller backups, just the changes.\n I've been thinking about number 3. To my mind, it's not so unproblematic. Currently, if you're editing something and the owner makes conflicting changes, you'll end up with a nasty merge eventually but you'll still be able to see your changes. If we implement backups with diffpatch, we might not even be able to apply someone's changes to the thing anymore so suddenly you wouldn't see your changes any more. Perhaps we'd be able to solve this by making sure we stored which version a patch was against and given the user some options at that point but I think it's an issue to think about.\n Sounds like a plan. For this case, I'd recommend something along the lines of:\n\n```\nif applying backup patch errors out\n    create a noty element with a button for opening a modal\n\nif user clicks the button\n    open a modal which lists all the changes in the patch. It's similar to patch_modal.coffee, where it can clean out conflicts.\n    if user says accept, they lose what changes are conflicted. Changes updated.\n```\n By the way, I expect things to get full much more slowly now that we clear localStorage backups whenever saving a new version. Plus, now there is a noty error to warn when JS errors happen, and it triggers when you cross this limit:\n\n![screenshot 2014-07-15 10 09 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/99704/3588376/de206eea-0c42-11e4-8783-cb98202771c1.png)\n\nI don't think we need much more on this one.\n  Right now the mongodb text search is returning everything rather than hits. Either\n\n1) Install Algolia and have that completely replace the text search (does it also work for individual dev environments?), or\n2) Fix the problem.\n I contacted Algolia and they said that they recommend to keep MongoDB for development environments. I'll look into the problem.\n The problem is MongoDB 2.5.5. Switch back to 2.5.4 to fix this issue.\n This issue does not seem to exist on the local server. On the web server, this is the error I get-\n\n[23:49:33.975] GET http://codecombat.com/db/level/search?project=yes&term=divide%20and%20conquer [HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable: Back-end server is at capacity 4707ms]\n\nSomething to do with the server itself, I presume?\n I'm on 2.5.4 as well. The search function works for me on the local server.\n Not really, no. It just seems to be working from the beginning. I think it works for Ruben as well.\n  Upon startup in an update of `mongo`, I got the warning \n\n`The text command will be removed in a future release.  \nUse the $text query operator instead.`\n\nWhile I believe our current text search is handled through the use of of the `mongoose-text-search` plugin, I have filed an issue to keep tabs on this. I think the most likely resolution is that mongoose itself will implement this functionality in future versions.\n The most likely resolution is that we switch to Algolia, I think.\n  Right now, we're only testing server-side tests in TravisCI. The reason why we're not running them now is that there is no easy way to run MongoDB 2.5. All that needs to be done is download MongoDB 2.5, extract it, run `mongod` in the background, then execute the server side tests. \n Would it be better to use spies and such to make the server tests run without a db? My impression of unit tests is they should have as few dependencies as possible. One upside to that is they should run faster. The downsides though include the extra work to rework the tests to not use the db, and the fact that they no longer actually test the interactions between the web server and the db.\n You have a good point. I think the right approach here would be to first do the very minimal work it takes to get the database running on the TravisCI server, then later put in the extra work to implement the db-free tests.\n Is there any progress on this? Perhaps using sinon to stub/spy mongoose?\n  Hi!\nI have translated the remaining lines and I also have modified a few lines that had some minor grammar mistakes. All the text is translated.\nCheers!\n    Added translated strings\n  This is caused by User objects being created for each request that does not have a User associated with it, and in this case when you first enter the site it makes requests to /auth/whoami and /db/user/schema at the same time and makes a User for each.\n\nWe could refactor the middleware /server/users/user_handler:setupMiddleware to only happen with /auth/whoami since that gets called whenever the app is initialized.\n  Hasn't fixed that offsetTop bug, but CreateJS is now updated.\n  I know that this is one of the GSoS ideas and I already sent in a proposal for the Developer Tools Window project. But I would be interested in taking this on if the other project doesn't work out. Would I be able (or do I need) to send in another proposal regarding this project?\n Okay I'll make sure to do that. Another question, when exactly do the accepted proposals get announced?\n Thanks\n In the couple of weeks that I have been working on this project, that when you try to integrate WebGL in the existing EaseLJS renderer (by changing the Container and Stage classes with SpriteContainer and SpriteStage respectively) it causes issues with the Shape class as WebGL doesn't support it. This will requires more research and experimentation to find a way for WebGL to function correctly in CodeCombat.\n\nAs a part of the process of seeing the performance difference between the EaseLJS and the WebGL renderers, I created an array in surface.coffee to show the current render speed while running a level. This array is then averaged out and displayed on the Javascript console while a level is being ran. The commit of this new array can be found in my forked repository here:\n\nhttps://github.com/therealbond/codecombat/commit/78877eaae83f14af58ad80708cad334a478db998\n\nSo far for me, on the \"Rescue Mission\" level I get an average ranging from 46.333 and 51.752.\n Here is surface.coffee with the classes changed in my forked repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/therealbond/codecombat/commit/9f5452b549b42a5345ee387100f556ae8ee95064\n\nOn the \"Rescue Mission\" level, I get an average ranging from 11.667 and 0.254 even though the level isn't working correctly.\n\n![selection_004](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6885216/2586909/1b21618c-ba0e-11e3-80f5-194c095f5c23.png)\n\nYou may not see it here, but the lips on the characters have a 3D look to them.\n @nwinter So basically something like an inheritance sort of thing? Or like an if-else type statement to cover both conditions for those that can and cannot support SpriteStage?\n Ohhh okay I see what you mean, okay I'll take a look at it when I get the chance, I've been really busy lately with school but I'll try to get to it as soon as I can.\n Did some research on this, and here's what I've found:\n- Drawing is taking about 90% of the CPU on the main thread. State updating is just 10%. So it is very important that we improve this one way or another.\n- It seems we can only use the WebGL renderer if _all sprites within any given SpriteContainer use the same SpriteSheet_. But in order to fit all Sprite assets into a single SpriteSheet, we'd need to bring the resolution way down and probably figure out ways to optimize which animations are rendered.\n- We can't just have different SpriteContainers for multiple SpriteSheets because then we can't layer Sprites correctly relative to one another. You can only sort Sprite layering if they share the same parent.\n\nSo it looks like, the way the EaselJS is set up, we can't utilize the WebGL rendering capabilities unless we severely drop the quality of the images we render, or do something really clever to control layering the way we want to.\n\nI've posted a [comment on the EaselJS WebGL technical blog post](http://blog.createjs.com/webgl-easeljs-a-technical-intro/#comment-4280) to see if we can get some input from them.\n They [responded](http://blog.createjs.com/webgl-easeljs-a-technical-intro/#comment-4284). Looks like for the time being we can't improve performance through this route, other than by doing something rather complex or clever or less flexible. I'm closing this for now at least.\n  No there isn't. One could be created though that just grabs the photoURL of a given user, or redirects the request to the photoURL. Then we'd also need to handle if there is no photoURL, perhaps in that case it would return a JSON response with info on how to tint the wizard avatar.\n Pimp my archmage! :dancers:\n Does this need more work? I can work on a new design/layout that showcases the user's gravatar thumbnail and links to Github profiles.\n\nCurrently the contributors list is hardcoded for now, perhaps it should be automatically pulled from Github or something?\n I have exams in the next few weeks and I'll work on this after exams. This actually looks nice as it is!\n Good enough.\n  I'd like to do this, but if someone else can write the text summary that'd be great. I'll try my best to write some summaries but my writing abilities are a bit iffy.\n This can be closed too since: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/382\n  - Translated \n  o most of the about page\n  o level editor headlines\n- some more de language fixes\n  What are the relevant files for this?\n  I think it would be cool to be able to have components start in a random location.  I'm thinking this will need to be done through a component.  I'm not really sure how it would work, but the arguments it would need would be a rectangle of locations where the component can be placed.  Then as it placed the item it would have to make sure it was not forming a collision with something that is already there (for times when more than one random item is placed).\n I might be interested, but I haven't installed the dev stuff, only working online.  Would I need to download to my machine in order to create a component?\n OK, so I just installed the VM and the CoCoLinux appliance, will look into playing with it later.\n OK, so I'm trying to think this through to make it as versatile as possible.  Couple thoughts:\n1. teleports seems much more broad than my original thought, wondering if they should be same component, or if there should be two components, `movement.Teleports` and `existence.RandomLocation`.\n2. teleports seems like it should have the possibility of teleporting to a specific point (with `thang.teleportXY()` ).  Possibly then it needs a `@teleportRange` to specify how far away he can teleport as well as a cooldown for time between teleportations.\n3. teleports could also have a randomness to it where the thang teleports to a random location every few seconds or something, this would then need the `teleportBounds` property.\n4. Should there be a `movement.TeleportsOthers` component as well?  This would need to have a range for how far the other thang is as well as how far you are moving that other thang.\n5. If there is a `movement.TeleportsOthers` component, maybe there should be a `movement.ResistsTeleportation` to prevent it from being teleported...\n\nWhat do others think?\n Just checking protocol here.  Is there some way that I should mark this thread to say that I'm working on it so that someone else doesn't decide to do it at the same time?\n\nIs there a time frame that I need to get this done in, such that if I'm unable to do it in a certain window I should just allow someone else to do it?\n Ok, finally getting some time to work on this...Just not exactly sure how to format components...  I'm trying to use movement.Moves as an example.  But I don't see how to actually implement the teleportBounds array.\n\nI think I've got the actual array sort of, but don't know how to access it in the code.  Also, not sure how to go about commiting my changes back to my fork in github so you can see em.\n  So on my level: http://codecombat.com/editor/level/lets-go-fly-a-kite\nI kill Ogres while kiting around in a circle.  When I pass ogres from left to right, the ogres bodies reflect to opposite position even after they are dead.  They seem to be turning to face me even though they are dead.\n\nBefore\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6550021/2047227/83f02d14-8a17-11e3-80ba-4eb881e6721c.png)\n\nAfter\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6550021/2047232/9ff226ac-8a17-11e3-9b44-e5e8fa839859.png)\n Hi @nemoyatpeace, thanks for reporting this. Could you please provide the player code with which you generate this error? Thanks! \n On this world: http://codecombat.com/play/level/lets-go-fly-a-kite\n\n```\n\nenemy=this.getNearestEnemy();\nd=this.distanceTo(enemy);\nif (d>20){\n    this.moveXY(enemy.pos.x,enemy.pos.y);\n}\nelse if(d<8){\n    X=this.pos.x*2-enemy.pos.x;\n    Y=this.pos.y*2-enemy.pos.y;\n    if(X<0){\n        Y+=5;\n        X+=1;\n    }\n    if(Y<0){\n        X-=5;\n        Y+=1;\n    }\n    if(Y>60){\n        Y-=1;\n        X+=5;\n    }\n    if(X>60){\n        X-=1;\n        Y-=5;\n    }\n    this.moveXY(X,Y);\n}\nelse{\n    this.attack(enemy);\n}\n```\n Just looking at the component code, wondering if:\n\nin `combat.Attackable` you could just call `thang.setTarget()` to remove his target.  Or would the dead ogre end up retargeting?  I'd try myself, but I'm unable to get my dev environment up yet, just digging in the component code until I have that ability!\n  Three users have reported this, and I have reproduced it.\n  Editor section translated to hungarian.\n Hi @atlantisguru, looks great! Thanks for the contribution :smile: \n  I didn't find how to translate this page: http://codecombat.com/account/settings#wizard-pane\nIt seems no i18n tag are present in the template.\n I'll research it tonight when I get home and let you know more once I found a solution.\n This shouldn't still be an issue, right @MartinDelille? There are i18n tags all over the place now\n Sorry but the parameters are always in english...\n  In the level editor in the system and component tabs, split out the treema on the right into three tabs: code, config schema, and everything else. Show code by default. This way these two important and key parts of these documents get the full right side of the screen. See how the level editor does this for levels; the settings tab is itself editing only a subset of the root properties of the level, leaving the editing of the scripts and thangs properties to other tabs.\n  Instead of continuing on the process of building out our own version control system further, we could hook in with our GitHub repository and use it to store and view history, each document being a gist. So whenever a new version of something like a component, system, thang or level is created, use the [Gist API](http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/) to update changes. For now, this could be only read only as that would be simplest, but later on we could also use it to handle, for example, pull requests for changes to any of these core pieces of data.\n Why not use a git repository instead of gists?\n\n[nodegit](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodegit) and [git.js](https://github.com/danlucraft/git.js) are good options, if git repositories are to be considered.\n The gists seem to have the right degree of complexity for saving a single database document. We can split out certain properties into individual files in a gist. It would also scale better, I would think. If we assign each document its own repository, that would seem too heavy-weight. But if we have all documents organized in a single repository, that would (eventually) be an awful lot of data in a single repository, since it would practically duplicate everything of substance in our db.\n\nThen again, we'd have more functionality if we used full repositories rather than gists. Like [forking and making pull requests](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8758612/can-i-make-a-pull-request-on-a-gist-on-github).\n If we have versioned documents, I'd say a git repository is better than storing them in database, if it is an option.\n\nOne repository per document would be a very bad choice, indeed. If documents need to be split into multiple files, a suitable directory structure can be planned for that.\n\nA gist is also a git repository, so I don't see how using a gist scales better than using a git repository.\n I think it's mostly conceptual, and how github organizes them differently. Gists compress all the data about the repository into a single page with a few tabs, whereas a repository has all sorts of extra stuff associated with it. If I were looking at a given Level document, or a given ThangType document, I'd rather look at something like the gist page rather than a full fledged repository page. Do we need things like branches, or pulse, or network, or issues? And we wouldn't want a slew of these showing up in the CodeCombat list of repositories, either. That's the main way in which it wouldn't scale, having all documents listed in the CodeCombat list of repositories.\n\nIf we put them all in a single repository, that won't work either. The repository would get very, very large assuming CodeCombat grows like we want it to grow. We could put what we have into a directory structure, a large one, but it still would get unwieldy after a while. Git repositories are not meant to be a versioning system for an entire database.\n\nGist: small and out of the way in the Github interface, can handle the kind of data we're trying to store, and has most of the features we'd want with version control.\n If we are looking at nice interface, gists are definitely better compared to a full repository.\n\nAnd regarding the suitability of git repository for versioning plain text data, even if there is large amounts of it, I think it is a difference of opinion. In my opinion, git stores the structure more effeciently and provides a richer control. Databases are good for storing state, and any other data that needs to be accessed efficiently. Document versioning is not one of the tasks databases are good at. Choosing a good directory structure demands some thought, though, if we are looking at something that can grow huge.\n Agreed, versioning would be better done with git, one way or another. At least most of the data we want to store; versioning the raw vector data for ThangTypes might not be a good idea.\n\nIf you can think of a good way to store the documents we want to store in a larger repository in a way that will scale, I'm down. We might consider doing gists for one use case and regular repositories for another. For example, players could hook their github account to their codecombat account and store all their sessions in a special repository. That would scale, and would make player's sessions fully versioned. But then in certain cases we'd want the code to be private **and** versioned (like ladder games, so people don't just easily copy from the top player). Another thing to think about.\n I haven't yet explored the codebase in full. Will review this after my exams are over and try to come up with a scalable git-based solution.\n  Also changed `log_out: \"Terminar sess\u00e3o\"` to `log_out: \"Sair\"` because it was \"breaking\" the website menu, it has the same meaning overall.\n Sorry I missed that, should be ok now.\n  If you use Turkish language for codecombat interface, you will be noticing \"\u011f\", \"\u015f\" letters are shown in different font. \n\nFirst example: logout.

Version 1.7.0 of brunch repo tested as working.\n  If there's one big pain point Gridmancer revealed, it's that this.say() just does not cut it for debugging. Create a wonderful interface for inspecting any given variable in the code at any given frame of the playback.\n  OK, let's challenge some gender stereotypes with a sexy character selection screen.\n\nHere's my plan: rather than the trad binary options (male/female), let's try to encompass a wider range of genders and, indeed, non-gendered people. Especially important for the little'uns who might be struggling with these issues!\n\nI discussed this at length with some colleagues who work in gender studies and here's what we came up with. If the ideas sound good, I'll get started on them!\n1. Sprite selection, not gender selection: users are presented with an array of sprites: some obviously male-inspired, some obviously female-inspired, some more androgynous, etc. and pick one.\n2. User enters the pronoun by which they'd like to be referred ('him', 'her', 'they', etc.)\n3. These are stored as global variables are referenced each time a call to render the character sprite, or reference to the character name, is made.\n\nOK if I get going on this?\n Oh wow, this is an important issue indeed. Would be good to have these 3 options. Good call :+1: Can't wait to see the concept art for this!\n  Hi.  I keep trying to change the code to have the character move right.  Sometimes it will work and he moves right, grabs the mushroom but then will not respond to additional code.  I hit the play button again and it gets caught in the moveRight(); command and doesn't move to moveLeft();\n\nOther times the character continues his path to attack the ogre and will not respond to any changes in code.  This is making this level unplayable / unbeatable.\n\nI've tried in chrome and firefox.  Firefox was the first time I could even get the character in this level to respond to any code (i.e. moveRIght(); and chrome just continues to attack the ogre leading to death.  \n\nThanks for any help.\n\nSteve\n\n![codecombat_bug](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6420572/1931351/b035373a-7ebd-11e3-8e7f-007edbde0dfc.JPG)\n Hi Nick,\nOf course as luck would have it I finally got it to work.  However, it\ntruly took about 10 times trying and refreshing the quest and trying again.\n IT would save my commands but the first number of times it would just got\nhung up and either continue to run through the original sequence of trying\nto kill the ogre and losing despite whatever code I had entered.

Finally it worked but I\ndon't know what was different.\nSteve\n\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2014 at 11:03 AM, Nick Winter notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> That's no good.

(See issue #181 for a mock-up)\n\nRef #181\n Okay, I added the new i18n tag and the jquery fading (also using the `level:session-will-save` callback).\nThe way the fading works now, is that the _Spell Saved_ is shown as long as there are changes being made. It will fade out if there have been no changes to the code for 6 seconds. I have only tested this in Firefox so far.\n  ``` javascript\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.bustDownDoor();\n\n// Delete the \"//\" in front of each line below.\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.say(\"Hey there!\");\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.say(\"Attack!\");\n\n// Now get Phoebe to follow through the dungeon.\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.say(\"Follow me.\");\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveUp();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveDown();\nthis.say(\"something\");\nthis.moveUp(); // Tharin gets stuck here\nthis.moveRight();\n```\n\nAt the line I marked, Tharin just keeps walking into the wall, until he gives up.\n\nAn alternate \"solution\" I've found meanwhile seems to be\n\n``` javascript\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.bustDownDoor();\n\n// Delete the \"//\" in front of each line below.\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.say(\"Hey there!\");\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.say(\"Attack!\");\n\n// Lure the other two ogres as well\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveUp();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.say(\"hey!\");\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.moveDown();\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.moveLeft();\nthis.say(\"Attack!\");\nthis.say(\"Attack!\");\n\n// Now get Phoebe to follow through the dungeon.\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.say(\"Follow me.\");\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveUp();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveRight();\nthis.moveRight();\n```\n\nbut that doesn't seem intentional considering that Thorin ends up at the brink of death.\n Hehe your second solution is quite original :+1: But yes this bug is quite and weird.

Add a property to User that specifies another User which administers it (make it a string, not an ObjectID).\n2. Modify the User handler to allow this property to be set (postEditableProperties, since I assume we wouldn't want that sort of relationship to be able to be removed after creation).\n3. Set up a view much like the Level search view the ability to create new Users and view existing ones (whose administering User they are), although no search feature in this case.\n4. Link that page to another new view which gives stats, shows code for a given administered User.\n\nMore advanced steps:\n1. Add restrictions to all Users with this property set, to act as a crude parental control.\n2. Integrate this whole thing with the existing permissions systems. Would need to migrate the existing (older) permissions array on User to a new property, like maybe 'privileges' or 'roles'.\n See also #1238.\n  Codecombat.com domain is not found from my location (yukon, canada).\n\nFrom a shell account in California `nslookup codecombat.com` returns \n\n```\n[balsa]$ nslookup codecombat.com\nServer:         64.90.63.202\nAddress:        64.90.63.202#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\ncodecombat.com  canonical name = cf-ssl45460-protected.codecombat.com.\nName:   cf-ssl45460-protected.codecombat.com\nAddress: 162.159.248.165\nName:   cf-ssl45460-protected.codecombat.com\nAddress: 162.159.247.165\n```\n\nPointing a browser to cf-ssl45460-protected.codecombat.com yields:\n\n```\nError 1001\nDNS resolution error\nWhat happened?\n\nYou've requested a page on a website (cf-ssl45460-protected.codecombat.com) that is on the CloudFlare network.

Hopefully it gets resolved soon!\n\nMy hypothesis is that there is some latency with CloudFlare's DNS updating when the DNS records update for the ELB, though you're probably correct in that it is an issue with CloudFlare itself.\n\nIn the meantime, you can access the ELB directly by following [this link](CoCoAppBalancer-727304820.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)\n\nHave a great day :smile:\n our dreamhost+CF site is back up, hopefully codecombat isn't far behind.\n  I'd like to work on this and created some simple mock-ups. \n\n![tmp_code_saving-2-2139154814](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2042399/1919865/6aa87a7e-7ddc-11e3-8967-9b710bf84b7c.png)\n\n![tmp_code_saved-871419254](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2042399/1919750/7e0f0e28-7dd9-11e3-9354-449c22540ed2.png)\nNot sure if this is the perfect place to put it.\nHave it fade out slowly, maybe.\n\n~~I assume there is a saving method somewhere, where I could modify the DOM/CSS when the code is saved?~~\nI think I found out how to do this, will update with a pull request.\n I'm fine with it and it seems like you made my JQuery a lot simpler, nice! :)\n  When editing a level, you often want to do something with the currently selected unit. Unless you remember the hotkeys, it's hard to manipulate whatever unit you've selected, without using the left menu (Current Thangs).\n\nWhen a user selects a Thang, a small actions menu should appear. \n\nThe menu could be displayed directly above the Thang or in a separate area of the screen.\n\nThe menu should allow the user to (same as #175): \n1) Edit - Same effect as double clicking on the Thang's name in 'Current Thangs'\n2) Duplicate - Same effect as alt+clicking a Thang in World Starting Conditions\n3) Delete - Same effect as pressing the 'Delete' (or Backspace) key\n\nDe-selecting the unit should cause the menu to disappear.\n\n@nwinter - This one needs some UI thinking.\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 10 22 37 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1897909/fa578246-7c01-11e3-9d59-9d9fbfd025d8.png)\n Toolbar at the top makes sense to me.

We could make this more clear by adding a dropdown menu to the 'Current Thangs' menu on the left.\n\nWhen a user hovers over a Thang in the 'Current Thangs' menu on the left, a small arrow should appear to indicate that a dropdown menu exists. Clicking that arrow triggers a dropdown menu with the following three options:\n1) Edit - Same effect as double clicking on the Thang's name in 'Current Thangs'\n2) Duplicate - Same effect as alt+clicking a thang in World Starting Conditions\n3) Delete - Same effect as pressing the 'Delete' (or Backspace) key\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 10 12 31 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1897876/944964c0-7c00-11e3-9564-c8b3397be1ad.png)\n Depending on how the menu is structured in #176, I don't think we need this feature.\n\nI was originally envisioning the 'on-unit' menu being available via right click but if we're surfacing a menu that's locked to the screen somehow, it makes sense to ignore this feature.\n  When selecting a Thang in the level editor, it's easy to get your Thangs mixed up (see what I did there?!) You have to look to the left menu to see which Thang is selected.\n\nInstead, selecting a Thang should display a small tooltip indicating the Type and Name of your currently selected Thang.\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 9 58 11 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1897849/c622490a-7bfe-11e3-8877-2dee857d229b.png)\n  Left click should not move the map. It should solely be used for selection of units. \n\nThis will avoid users accidentally moving the map around when selecting units, and accidentally selecting units when moving the map around.\n\nWhen the user hovers over a unit on the map, the mouse cursor should become the standard Pointer cursor (cursor: pointer;)\n\nThe user should move the map by either:\n1) Holding Spacebar and left clicking then dragging the map\n\nWhen the user holds Spacebar, the mouse cursor should become the CSS3 Grab cursor (cursor: -webkit-grab; cursor: -moz-grab;) to indicate that the user can grab the map and move it.\n\nWhen the user releases spacebar, the mouse cursor should return to normal.\n\nWhile holding Spacebar, if the user left clicks, the mouse cursor should become the CSS3 Grabbing cursor (cursor: -webkit-grabbing; cursor: -moz-grabbing;).\n\nIf the user releases spacebar while left click is still pressed, the cursor should return to normal and the map should stop moving.\n\nWhen left click is released, the cursor should return to normal and the map should stop moving.\n\n2) Pressing and holding Middle Click and dragging the map\n\nWhen the user clicks and holds Middle Click, the mouse cursor should become the CSS3 Grabbing cursor (cursor: -webkit-grabbing; cursor: -moz-grabbing;).\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 9 53 46 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1897836/f2f8da1c-7bfd-11e3-8c75-e2174fdec986.png)\n Skeptical but willing to try. I feel like this sort of control is more for editors (like it reminds me of blender) but its not so good for players, especially people for whom middle buttons are not available. Still, the current system has its own downsides.\n Intuitively, I drag on the map or try to play with typical RTS controls. This might just be an intuitive design for RTS players however. The click and move system is nice but I agree that it has its limitations.\n\nI do think the proposed solution is not much more intuitive however. Space + drag is not a very common control. Middle click is better but still not on every device. I would suggest right click and drag with a backup set of arrow buttons to move the screen a designated amount of units. (Something more like google maps?)\n @sderickson I was specifically thinking about the editor when coming up with this movement scheme. The compromise could be allowing arrow keys to use the map #172, but this is tough to discover.\n\n@dristic Originally, I was suggesting right click and drag to move the map, but I wasn't sure how the team felt about overriding right click in a browser (traditionally something I've tried not to do when possible)\n @bdickason Just for the editor sounds good. I'm pro!\n Regarding the constraints around pointing devices (might not have middle click) and the unconventional (hold space), we could also have left or right click trigger the drag. I would suggest right click in this case, as the left click action should be reserved for selection of Thangs to avoid confusion (i.e. you left click on a huge grass tile and drag a bit - are you trying to move the tile? or move the map?)\n @bdickason The unfortunate truth of browser games is that you need all the inputs! This is why the capture mouse API was invented for instance.\n  When the user has focused the map (clicked anywhere in the map as last action) in the Level Editor, they should be able to use the arrow keys to move around the map.\n\nUp - Move map up\nDown - Move map down\nRight - Move map right\nLeft - Move map left\n\nHolding down the keys should continue to move the map in that direction.\n\nA user should be able to press two keys at once to move the map in two directions at once, assuming they are not opposing directions.\n Started working on this one but needs lots of tweaks. Still not familiar with the project so hardcoded values for wizard and camera movement. Boundary checks must be added too. mnmtanish/codecombat@43db3e1117d7aaeb0f5b5af6b213301be3ad1a48\n If possible, can someone point me which code **moves and centers the camera on wizard when we click on some place on the map** I'm checking coffee files under _/app/lib/surface/_ but still got nothing.\n You're in the right area, but it's a bit convoluted.\n\nEach /app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee listens for mouse events. When the mouse button is lifted (pressup) it emits a sprite:mouse-up event.\n/app/lib/surface/SpriteBoss.coffee hears this event in onSpriteMouseUp, and calls selectSprite, which calls the Camera.zoomTo function, and also emits the 'surface:sprite-selected' event.\n/app/lib/surface/WizardSprite.coffee hears this event and moves there.\n\nHope that helps!\n Thanks, I'll check those files.\n\nBut if we made the camera to always follow the wizard (except perhaps with cut-scenes). Then it'll let users become more the wizard and move around the map rather than us dragging the map where the wizard is just a character. (I can go on with _becoming the wizard_ idea, maybe somewhere else). The wizard-following camera can be used with both mouse click and keyboard movements.\n For the most part this happens. There are some movements where the wizard follows (clicking, selecting a unit) and others where the wizard doesn't (zooming to a position, dragging the map). We could experiment with having the wizard move during all of them. It doesn't make sense to tightly couple it in the code though, since there are times the Camera doesn't quite focus on the wizard (like when selecting a unit, the unit is the focus, not the wizard floating nearby).\n @sderickson Thanks for those info. Used them to improve the code. Now the wizard and the camera moves smoothly and accurately. mnmtanish/codecombat@4d9537403568671d2abd2986387096c8987bf415\n- playback_view.coffee listens for keyboard events and publishes 'self-wizard:move'. \n- LevelBus.coffee moves the wizard (now hardcoded 10 units) and publishes 'camera-zoom-to'\n- Camera.coffee moves the camera to where the wizard ends up (parallel to wizard movement)\n  When a level is put together, the ScriptManager appends the user's scripts with common scripts. Currently, it looks like these common scripts support a help-like system involving Captain Anya.\n\nWe should get rid of commonScripts for two reasons:\n1. Greater flexibility in level creation (i.e. if somebody wants to create a level where Anya is not present).\n2. More transparency to the end-user, nothing being added to their level without them knowing.\n\nThe commonScripts are loaded in lines 16 and 69 in ScriptManager:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/scripts/ScriptManager.coffee\n\nAnd exist here:\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/scripts/commonScripts.coffee\n Works for me\n  Currently, the user must click once to select a Thang then click again to place it. In addition to this functionality, the user should also be able to drag the Thang onto the canvas.\n\n1) A User should be able to click and drag a Thang from the 'Add Thangs' toolbar onto the map. The cursor should change to the CSS3 Grabbing cursor (cursor: -webkit-grabbing; cursor: -moz-grabbing) when the Thang is being grabbed and the Thang should be pinned to the cursor.\n2) A User should be able to release the mouse cursor to place a Thang onto the map. The cursor should revert to a normal cursor and the Thang should be selected once they place it. The Thang should be unpinned from the cursor.\n3) A User should be able to press escape while dragging a Thang to clear their selection and return cursor to a normal state. This should cause the Thang to be unpinned from their cursor as well.\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 7 39 54 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1897574/e599a43a-7beb-11e3-8c4d-77aba966b93c.png)\n Good point. I had started thinking about that last night but didn't have the time to put together a prototype to try it out.\n\nMy thought was that dragging the portrait should actually place the sprite on your cursor... but I realize this could be difficult before you get it to the canvas. \n\nWe could also have the portrait turn into the sprite once you reach the canvas? And convert back to portrait once you return the mouse to the toolbar (if you're still dragging).\n  Currently, the interaction when hovering over a Thang provides very little additional information or feedback to the user.\n\n1) Hovering over a Thang should surface the Type (e.g. Tharin or Artillery) of the Thang you're looking at.\n2) Hovering over a Thang should slightly enlarge the Portrait of the Thang you're looking at.\n3) Hovering over a Thang should slightly alter the background and border of the Thang you're looking at.\n4) Hovering over a Thang should use the Grab CSS3 cursor: webkit-grab; cursor: moz-grab; to indicate you can click on it\n\nSee below screenshot for an example. Note this is just a wireframe, the design should follow the standard Code Combat design style.\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 7 17 43 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1897526/23b46858-7be8-11e3-8642-63c6d56bf5a4.png)\n It might be wiser not to use the thang portrait view. I was thinking one thing that would be good for the level editor to do would be to load things like thang types dynamically so the editor doesn't take forever to load. I think last I checked all the thang types alone take over 7mb. Ideally the portraits use the image thumbnails instead of the raw vector data so the editor isn't blocking on them. That would be more complicated too though as the system would have to load thang types as they're added to the level. Which can be arranged with some well placed callbacks.\n  OK tried recreating this bug and you're correct, the language menu doesn't open. (just as a confirmation)\n  In the Level Editor, a user left clicks on a Thang that has been placed on the map in order to select it. Once selected, the Thang displays a small blue targeting reticle around the Thang.\n\nCertain Thangs seem to be too big and hide the blue targeting circle.\n\nFor example, the 'Repair' Thang does not display a blue circle underneath it.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1) Load the level editor - http://codecombat.com/editor/level/run-from-danger\n2) Select the 'Repair' Thang from the Add Thangs menu\n3) Place the 'Repair' Thang on the map\n4) Hit escape to cancel placement of another thang\n5) Left click on the 'Repair' Thang to select it\n\nExpected Result: blue targeting circle is displayed\n\nCurrent Result: User does not know if the thang has been selected or not\n\nSelection working as intended:\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 2 20 41 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1896877/d9b269a4-7bbe-11e3-9919-e968bc7fcac8.png)\n\nSelection is not visible:\n![screen shot 2014-01-12 at 2 20 44 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1896878/e2618cb0-7bbe-11e3-8c83-a5e307be8eac.png)\n @nwinter I haven't figured out marking points in the level yet, so I was just placing them as experiments. As long as there are clear ways to mark a target point (which I've seen you guys do in the basic levels), I don't think there's any issue with removing them.\n  Scrolling up or down in the 'Add Thangs' menu can cause the entire browser window to scroll up or down. This behavior is confusing and can cause glitches when placing Thangs.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1) Load the level editor - http://codecombat.com/editor/level/run-from-danger\n2) Set your browser to a height where the canvas is not fully displayed (i.e. the browser creates a scroll bar at the edge of the screen)\n3) Scroll to the very top and very bottom of the 'Add Thangs' menu and continue scrolling in either direction.\n\nExpected Result:\nWhen scrolling within the 'Add Thangs' menu, the browser should never scroll.\n\nCurrent Result:\nScrolling at the edge of the 'Add Thangs' menu scrolls the browser up or down.\n\nAn example of the expected result can be seen in Pinterest's \"More in this board\" scrolling menu (see screenshot below): http://www.pinterest.com/pin/364369426074051739/\n\n![pinterest scroll menu example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1896865/e8b33f74-7bbd-11e3-8efb-b81e3e3f8606.png)\n This is probably a solution that might work: http://jsfiddle.net/rudiedirkx/F8qSq/show/ (via http://stackoverflow.com/a/20520619)\n\nI will see if I can get this working later today.\n @phansch that looks exactly like what we need! Let me know your progress and/or if you got it working!\n This is more difficult that I thought. It seems the behavior of the `mousewheell` / `DOMMouseScroll` event is different for each browser. See [MDN: mousewheel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/mousewheel), [MDN: DOMMouseScroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/DOMMouseScroll) and [MDN: wheel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/wheel?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2FMozilla_event_reference%2Fwheel)\n\nI got it working in Firefox, but then it doesn't work in Chrome (and vice versa). I didn't try the other browsers yet. Also there are changes between different jQuery versions.\n\nWill give the `wheel` event a try tomorrow.\n Works great, thanks!! :)\n  Before\n3 tests, 7 assertions, 3 failures\n\nAfter\n10 tests, 61 assertions, 0 failures\n Great work, we definitely need more tests, so I was very happy to see this pull request :smile:\n Adding tests, I understand better Code Combat.\nThis is how I learn nodejs/coffeescript.\n\nChanging only the tests, I do not risk breaking something.\nI'm glad to be able to help this great project.\n\nThank you.\n  @nwinter could you provide some details on where that loading happens?\n This issue should be resolved. Please confirm and close if so.\n  When I'm working on my larger machine, I tend to zoom out and observe the level as a whole occasionally. When doing so, the grid axis text and coordinates text becomes very blurry. \n\nText should always appear sharp and crisp.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1) Load the level editor with any level selected\n2) Zoom out all the way\n3) Observe the numbers on the grid axis\n\n(Click to view full screenshot to see a more obvious view of the bug)\n\n![screen shot 2014-01-11 at 6 30 15 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/202162/1895166/a6ffa0c2-7b18-11e3-89f2-ff4d1784a79d.png)\n  Remove the initial timer and add on/off timers to keep the canvas from drawing 100% of the time on the home page.\n Done and done. Thanks!\n  Fixes issue #26\n Ok I signed it :)\n\nBtw: how is this legal? Can't anyone sign that with any github username, even though it doesn't belong to you.  Wouldn't it be safer if you have to prove it's your account by forcing the user to login via github.\n Yes true. Was just wondering.  So am I OK now?\n  What if you add dots if it's too long ? http://jsfiddle.net/k5VET/ This might be interesting if you think it's a good solution.\n Hi @guitarsora, that solution isn't bad! You can also get the same result with CSS styles like this\n\n```\nwidth: 120px\noverflow: hidden\ntext-overflow: ellipsis\nwhite-space: nowrap\n```\n\nThe hard part is getting the icon after the ellipsis.\n Oooh my poor name didn't fit :( And my complete name (with all my first names) will never fit anyway. \n@schmatz  your solution works, i used it as the inspiration for the fix for this issue.\n  CodeCombat Spell IDE says that there is something wrong with the move.XY statement but there isn't.\n\n![screenshot from 2014-01-10 19 01 53](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3178485/1890266/f77d81d0-7a29-11e3-812d-6d7bf693893a.png)\n Oddly I passed the level anyway even with that mistake at the bottom...\n\nAnd yes, that would be very helpful, thanks for pointing that out to me.\n  Added a file and translations for Bahasa Malaysia using the latin characters as provided in the Google Doc.

Thoughts?\n  Hi folks,\n\nJust a spare few minutes spent improving the flow of the front page of the site: a little more vertical space, more compelling copy, and more prominent placement of the call to action. Also, I've added 'What?', 'Why?' and 'How?' links that could link to (or reveal via accordion) an 'About' section; a section discussing the merits of this kind of gamification over Codecademy's YAY BADGE variant; and a more tech-centric explanatory document with links to this repo to encourage contribution (respectively).\n\nImage attached.\n\n![codecombat_redesign](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1960230/1887656/13381f8a-7a01-11e3-9727-29cae4def609.jpg)\n Hi sjmog! Nicely done, the front page does need some redesigning, and this gives us a lot of food for thought. Here are my thoughts:\n1. We'd prefer to stay away from terms like 'kill'. Our first stab at a campaign had the term 'murder' thrown around a bunch and we got feedback that people prefer softer terms for the li'l ones. Maybe our standard tagline: \"Learn to code with a multiplayer programming game.\" would go better. It communicates the core parts of the site: that you're learning, that it's programming, that it's multiplayer, and that it's a game.\n2. I personally would like on the frontpage links and short descriptions for not only playing the game but also: 1) the contribute page, 2) the GitHub page, and 3) the editor. But, since this is such an important part of the page, we should probably spend some time hashing out together what we as a group think is most important to have people see the first time they visit the site. Once we figure that out, then designing out the layout comes next.\n3. I like the become a digital wizard. We're having trouble sometimes getting newcomers to understand that they are the wizard, so starting off with that might help.\n\nLet's use this issue as a main place to put down our thoughts on what the front page should become. If you want to hash out ideas with Nick, George and I real time join us on our [public HipChat room](http://www.hipchat.com/g3plnOKqa).\n Hi sderickson! Nice to meet you: I'm moving from a 9-5 back to freelance, so I should have much more time to devote to Open-Source projects. I think CodeCombat has real promise as _the_ system for teaching children and young adults to code. I think it's also a great platform for introducing kids to the open source community, its values, and the generally progressive ethos we have going on here. With that in mind, I'd love to get much more involved beginning in February!\n1. Totally understand. How about 'beat' instead? Not as in 'beat up', but more as in 'beat the bad guys'? In copywriting there's a principle called the 'rule of three': sentences of three words, themselves in groups of three, are very effective in trad marketing.\n2. I completely agree. I had a few minutes and wanted to get my ideas about the visual aesthetic across, but if I could join in a more general UX discussion I'd love to.\n3. Thanks! I think it's quite a compelling tag line.\n\nI'll join you on HipChat once I get the time \u2013 I'm on GMT here, so what hours are best?\n  Copied Ukrainian strings from Google doc to uk.coffee.\n  The cliff image in the \"Lead Followers\" level blends so much on the top and bottom edges, I wasted time trying to walk on top of it. (Sneak attack from above with a bottleneck.) Instead, the characters moved behind it to the left & couldn't pass between its base and the rocky field.\n\nThe cliff's staircase shape would be more obvious if its left edge were rimmed with, say brown.\n You could find all shapes that have that given green and change their fill colors. Probably would do that programmatically unless there are very few shapes to change.\n  I have finished the  first draft.\n Looks great.\n there is still two places need to translate... \n That's fine- for the untranslated lines, please make the string blank, and comment out the line.  Thanks.\n\nOn Jan 9, 2014, at 10:28 PM, Adam23 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> there is still two places need to translate...\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n make the string blank, and comment out the line.

I made a very basic level containing a selectable tree named \"Tree 4\".\n\nThis tree acknowledges when it's been selected when I check if its id == \"Tree 4\" like so:\n![selectatree2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2514777/1884941/4413444a-79b6-11e3-96f6-0f5de2b8d917.png)\n\nHowever, it does not when I ask it if its id Contains the string \"ee\", which it definitely should:\n![selectatree](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2514777/1884943/640cb89e-79b6-11e3-8638-ca92171d144a.png)\n\nHave I missed something obvious?\n @nwinter Yup, that did it. Thanks!\n @p-buse  how is it going with this issue. Have you been able to solve it yet?\n @GlenDC It's going well. I've actually coded it up here: https://github.com/p-buse/codecombat/tree/eventcheck-regexp and it seems to work OK, but there's still a bug with the string selection system in general that I can't figure out.\n\nThe \"Contains\" event checker seems to be having false positives when you DESELCT Thangs.\nHere's the code for my event check:\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2514777/1971075/120d4226-831f-11e3-8287-c6aab22d71eb.png)\n\nAnd here's the result when I click on the grass, deselecting everything:\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2514777/1971081/29c0ec4c-831f-11e3-8690-80b40ab3c05b.png)\n\nThe RegExp checker I wrote seems to fall prey to the same trap, triggering when I deselect Thangs.\n @nwinter Just tested with the latest version and the behavior is still there. When checking whether a thang's id contains a string in the surface:sprite-selected event, the script fires every time the user clicks the background, deselecting the thangs.\n\nOn a related note, when checking that a thang's id does not contain a string, the script never fires.\n @nwinter I hadn't checked out the latest update! I just tried it with the newest version and everything works now, including regular expression checking.\n  Added a missing quote at the last line.\n  Copied the Russian versions of the static text strings from the google doc to ru.coffee.\n  I'm having someone on my team take a look at this. One thing we were thinking about doing after we've used up all the names in the main list is pulling registered user names from the database. (for humans) (Call of Duty: Black Ops does that for its bots) Do you guys have any thoughts on that @nwinter @gsaines ?\n  The new \"Contact\" link uses the text cursor instead of the pointer cursor. I made all the footer links display the pointer cursor.\n  I've copied the Russian text from the Google doc to ru.coffee: 96b995ed60cdd068d40fcc19f3c9996d2eb0ce2a\nNext week hopefully I will be able to work on the Ukrainian translation as well.\n\nAlso, I've heard one has to sign some kind of agreement to participate in the translation, how is this done properly?\n @nwinter thanks, done that now.\n Working on this right now\n Okay, there should be more than 1 person doing all the remaining languages.\n\nSo if you want to claim a language- first put a big notification stating that you are going to transcribe that google doc to the locale file\n Translated the static strings into Ukrainian as well: 8902ba9\n I'm currently working on the German translation but I feel like the local file contains more recent translations than the spreadsheet. Should I just copy over everything that's different anyway?\n\nI just submitted a pull request for now.\n What about the levels? There are still many text has not been exported into tr.coffee. How can we export them?\n\nI saw a pull request but it seems it has failed building: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/235\n  I have signed  the CodeCombat Individual Contributor License Agreement\n Hi @Adam23, thanks for wanting to help translate CodeCombat into Chinese! The easiest thing to do would be use the [English translation file](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/en.coffee) and the Chinese translation files ([\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/zh-HANS.coffee) and [\u7e41\u4f53\u5b57](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/locale/zh-HANT.coffee)) to create translations of the site into Chinese.\n\n@nwinter, for future reference, what is the method of onboarding people for level translations?\n Thanks ! :D\n  https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/108\n :+1: \n  Well that's logical:\n\nWhat we do now in the [user.coffee file](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/models/User.coffee) is requesting the user profile, and as this [Gravatar Developer page](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/profiles/) tells us: _\"An important point to note is that profile requests will only resolve for the hash of the primary address on an account. \"_\n\nThis brings us to 2 options:\n- Either this is intentional, and so we have to tell users that we only allow the user of your primary _Gravatar_ email.\n- We redesign the system so that we don't user the profile request and don't allow the people to choose which picture to use. Instead we just get the image based on that email address, and redirect the user to the official Gravatar site where he can manage his images and select which image to use for which email address. \n\n@nwinter which option would you prefer?\n I think we might want to move away from requiring gravatar accounts to do things like pictures. Now that we have GridFS set up, we should make it so people can upload photos if they want, or default to the portrait of their custom-colored wizard. We can also make it possible (and keep as the default behavior) to use their primary gravatar photo if the email they provide gets us one. So the logic would be:\n1. If not yet chosen a photo\n   1. if email leads to gravatar photo, use that\n   2. Else use rendered wizard avatar.\n2. Else use chosen photo (from wizard avatar, gravatar photo, or uploaded photo)\n Gravatar allows selecting different pictures for different ids. And as such, asking the user again to select a picture from his/her gravatar pictures seems unnecessary to me. Using the email hash directly to request a picture is better IMO.\n\nEven if you support file uploads, gravatar is a nice-to-have option. I end up uploading the same pic everywhere usually.\n  If you use the shift-space combination at least 5 times per page load, a message will pop up next to the continue button stating that you can press esc to skip dialog.\n![screen shot 2014-01-08 at 2 22 28 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/933422/1873091/14cc7d30-78b4-11e3-9a63-04fcfa67bdee.png)\n\nAddresses https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/108\n  Yes, that could work. It would be kind of hacky though, mainly because we'd need some sort of special endpoint for this situation only. Just creating the Campaign type might be a better use of time, and not that much more difficult. Here would be the respective steps:\n\nCreate string property\n1. Extend the level schema with this sort property\n1. Set up the handler to allow editing of it by admins\n1. Set up db.coffee to route for a special kind of fetch.\n1. Maybe add an index to the db for it? Assuming level creation doesn't explode, probably not needed.\n\nCreate Campaign\n1. Copy everything on the server from an existing model, like Article, into new Campaign files.\n1. Copy everything on the browser for an existing editor, like again Article, and modify to handle Campaigns.\n1. Make sure the schema in the Campaign properly links to Level models.\n\nBoth require a bunch of figuring out the existing systems. The former's probably easier. Both would be learning experiences.\n I've started work on this. Mostly building out a campaign model and associated views for this.\n Yeah, we finally did this with the new campaign editor!\n  @nwinter How were you thinking it might work? Like a note in the HUD dialogue box?\n Addressed this with https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/116\n  It's coffee no parentesis needed :}\n Count on me, I will take care of all this weekend ;)\n @MDP66, please sign [this agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) as soon as is convenient. Thank you for your coffee-tastic contributions so far, and we look forward to more in the future! :smile:\n Hey @MDP66, I hate to bother you again, but could you please sign the [CLA](http://www.codecombat.com/cla)? Thanks!\n  I think it's certainly because from where I play (mainland China)  Facebook (as well as twitter, g+ etc.)  is blocked so it will not load any resource hosted on their servers. which certainly create this bug \n\ncan it be possible to not make mandatory this facebook thingy\n Great idea Allan. After the bug occurred, were you able to move on to more levels, or did it severely interfere with the gameplay?\n Actually that totally stopped my progression from there, i try clicking everywhere but no result :s . (anyway i was suppose to click on \"done\" right ?) \n\notherwise playing single level at a time does not seems to cause problem\n That is quite a problem then! Given that we're getting more Chinese players, it would be good to get this fixed soon! For anyone interested in fixing this, there are several steps necessary:\n1. Identify when a player has an IP originating from [Chinese IP blocks](http://www.okean.com/antispam/china.html)\n2. Replace all censored social media links with either nothing or Chinese social media links\n\nI'm sure there is a good package for IP geolocation somewhere.\n sure, it fixes the problem, thanks \n  A few more names.\n @Tavio, please sign [this agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) as soon as is convenient. Thank you for your contributions! \n  Hi, I'm French and I like CodeCombat.\nI enjoy translate things from English to French.\nIf you agree, I can translate many of levels dialogues :D\n Hi @armaldio, thanks for the contribution, and having you translate more would be awesome! The process for translation of levels is a little different than editing files like `fr.coffee`, but in the meantime if you'd like to translate the rest of fr.coffee, feel free!\n\n@nwinter, what should @armaldio do to begin translation of levels?\n Thanks ! :D\nI will continue traduction of fr.coffee while I have time ;)\n Thank _you_, @armaldio! Sounds great :smile:\n\nAnd thank you for your thoughtful suggestions @simonrenoult! \n @armaldio , please sign [this agreement](http://codecombat.com/cla) as soon as is convenient. I was so happy with your French translations I forgot to have you sign the CLA. Thank you for your contributions so far, and we look forward to more in the future :smile: \n That's Ok, I hope we'll all enjoy :D\n  Let registered users know which levels they have completed or are currently working on. This could be a simple little flag until more levels are built and a more comprehensive accomplishments system is in the works.\n\nThis might also help get more people to try more levels because they can visually see their progress.\n One simple way to get this going would be to download all LevelSession objects for a given user and show the 'state' for them in the /play page. Sessions have a flag at state.complete for if the level ever got to a victory script.\n  From [this article,](http://www.blogduwebdesign.com/programation-jeu/apprendre-javascript-maniere-ludique-jeu-codecombat/1150) the author thinks that these would be a good feature to offer to more advanced developers. I think it would be pretty awesome to have, especially as the contingent of more experienced developers increases.\n Seems like this is not done yet. @GlenDC are you still planning on working on this? Otherwise I would love to work start working on this as I anyways started digging into all the Ace related things :)\n  Tried installing and ran into the following error in step 4. I assume manually reinstalling node should fix things, but since the error message said to contact you, I'm doing this. :)\n\n```\n>sudo python ./coco/scripts/devSetup/setup.py\nPassword:\nCode Combat Development Environment Setup Script\nMac detected, architecture: 64 bit\nRuby found.\n/bin/sh: mongod: command not found\nMongod not found.\nMongoDB 2.5.4 not found, so installing...\nDownloading MongoDB from URL http://fastdl.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.5.4.tgz\n[######################################################################] 100.0% \nDecompressing MongoDB...\nDecompressed MongoDB into /Users/johngoering/codecombat/coco/bin/tmp/mongo\nDownloading Node from URL http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.24/node-v0.10.24-darwin-x64.tar.gz\n[######################################################################] 100.1% \nDecompressing Node...\nDecompressed Node into /Users/johngoering/codecombat/coco/bin/tmp/node\nA previous version of npm has been found. \nYou may experience problems if you have a version of npm that's too old.Would you like to upgrade?(y/n) \ny\nRetrieving npm update script...\nRetrieved npm install script.

The GitHub labels system allows for them to be clicked on and it filters the active issues. I'd also argue that they need to be organized by their realm of programming, but that raises the question of how many labels are too many labels?\n HabitRPG has done this extensively, see: https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg/issues\n\nWhich made it easy for me to jump in yesterday and make my first commit.\n I really like this idea. @nwinter, what do you think?\n I'm down for trying a bunch of different labels. We can always remove some labels if they turn out to be less helpful.\n What some places do (Mozilla, for example) is that when they pick up a bug and find out that it's a very easy fix that touches interesting components, they mark it as \"good for newbies\", and keep it around. Then they help newcomers fix up those tickets, with a mentor of sorts that helps people get going with the browser project, the workflow, etc. Other bugs might have priorities or general effort guesstimates, though.\n\nSimpler than putting effort into trying to assess the approximate difficulty level of every issue that comes through.\n I was just going to mention [Mozilla's way of doing](https://github.com/mozilla/persona/wiki/The-Persona-BrowserID-Bug-Process) it as well. I always found the star system in Mozilla projects to be a good indicator of their difficulty. I think a 'beginner bug' label would be a good start. From there we could see if it'll be beneficial to add more specific difficulty levels.\n I think, btw, that bug priorities and being marked as beginner bugs are orthogonal.\n  The blog link in the navbar on http://codecombat.com/ leads to tumblr - should be http://blog.codecombat.com instead\n  Related to #90 I propose refactoring spells into _scrolls_, their written form, which are exposed in a Wizard's library for starters. Then we could allow players to browse other wizards' libraries for all scrolls corresponding those they've managed themselves. This could be suggested at when players finish their level (I haven't checked CheckiO yet, but I know Project Euler does so), but also players should be able to reach these libraries in another way, i.e. through the wizard's name.\n  Currently we're still on 2.3.2.\n http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#migration\n\nHere are the migration docs for further reference.\n  Fixed.\n  ![developer tools - http___localhost_3000_play_level_gridmancer 2014-01-09 19 01 50](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/964386/1878081/a7f67b62-7934-11e3-9242-46bfab79600b.png)\nthe vector object isnt being deleted.\n  Can't reproduce. Works the same for me in both browsers with my Microsoft USB mouse.\n  Ok I'll take a look a this issue. Where would the documentation for all the components and systems have to be? On the normal Wiki?\n Basically no one but me writes these (self-fulfilling prophecy?), so I'm not going to spend time exhaustively documenting them.\n  @nwinter Fixed the latter two parts, I think. Couldn't reproduce Maksym's issue, though.\n  Fixed issues 13 and 14, and added all of the contribute pages.\n I'll try it out. It's not really more work, as much as it is learning new tools.\n\nPlus, all of that is extremely straight forward, so it won't be hard to do.\n @nwinter Fixed everything you mentioned. And a couple other small bugs laying around that I didn't catch earlier.\n\nLooking at my commit though I'm not sure how RootView got changed, I didn't touch it any point other than to reference it, but whatever.\n  Perhaps, it's better for mac.\n Yes, it works with Firefox.\n  We can't run test.\nCoco directory is hard coded in bin shell script.\n  https://github.com/replit/jsrepl will this serve the purpose? they have the mentioned languages interpreters compiled to js with emscripten.\n https://github.com/opal/opal I guess this could do the job for Ruby. It says to translate from Ruby to JS, so probably the compiler which is already in place could be used.\n  http://michaelficarra.github.io/CoffeeScriptRedux/ , `CoffeeScript.parse()` gives the CS AST, good thing is `coffeescriptredux` is written to be extensible :) \n I would be concerned with this feature. Although it is great in theory to support any language, you open up a huge number of support issues when a user is working in python and they run into a problem with a level (for example).\n\nYou also reduce the ability for a user to come to CodeCombat and easily help another user.\n\nFor example:\n\"I come to Codecombat.com to help another user when they're stuck (Guide class, I believe), and I login and find that this user is writing in Clojure.. which I don't know.\"\n\nMy hunch is that sticking with one, universally popular language (javascript) will help keep the game and company focused and provide a very clear starting point and progression path for users.\n\nJust my two cents.\n Just seen that there is actually an issue for this :) I'm on it just need to fix some small things in Aether to run smoothly :)\n  Probably just copy everything from the Article views use and tweak/trim as desired. Except for the 'preview' files, those aren't needed.\n\n[Article views](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/views/editor/article)\n[Article templates](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/templates/editor/article)\n[Article styles](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/tree/master/app/styles/editor/article)\n This is needed now to resolve links from version history of systems and components. Currently clicking on an old version's title takes you to /editor because these links aren't being handled. I'd like to be able to easily see the history of these so this is on my backlog if no one gets here first.\n To summarise conversation with @nwinter, we'd want to have: \n- a standalone canonical view of a component or system\n- that's read-only when viewing an old version\n- with urls like /editor/component/[slugOrId] where slug would load current version and id would load a specific previous version (noting that the slug could change over time so id is the way to go for history)\n  From Tom Steinbrecher: for some reason log in, and create account aren't working in my dev environment when in firefox, but it does in chrome.\n Yup, I think you solved them. The login/create account is working across all browsers on my dev environment.\n  Translations for levels are ingrained in the Level documents themselves. We need a way for Diplomats (that is, anyone who wants to) to work on these translations. So the goals for this issue are:\n1. Make a way, both on the server and on the client, for Diplomats to submit translation changes to these public Levels without being able to also make changes to the rest of the parts of the Level document.\n2. Minimize, prevent or handle conflicts if two or more Diplomats are submitting changes at the same time. Up until now, Levels would only ever be changed by their creators, and the infrequent times two people might be working on the same document at the same time they could easily let each other know, and so there's no system for handling the race condition where two people work on the same document at the same time and then each submitting changes, one overwriting the other. If an email goes out to a bunch of people that a new Level is ready for translating, it's much more likely this will happen.\n3. Batch these changes where possible. Currently the versioning system simply copies the entire document when a change is made. This could possibly explode the number of documents in the database for a given Level, which are rather large documents, if a copy is made for each translation of each string. We don't have to minimize the number of changes, but a simple way to cut the magnitude of changes made, if it's not too difficult or time consuming, would be worth the time.\n\nHere's one possible solution:\n\nFor each editor (Level, Thang, Article)\n- When making changes, flag all documents being edited on Firebase.\n- When the editor opens, check for these flags and notify the user that someone else is working on the given document, suggesting that they come back later.\n- Create a tab for translations listing all translations and with form entries for them. This requires walking the whole document object looking for i18n properties, then displaying them in the view, and then gathering up the values given in the view and submitting them to the handler. Ideally this system would also know where to insert i18n properties using the document's schema.\n- Set up the handler to be able to receive special put or post methods for submitting translations and only modifying those values. As part of finding the i18n properties to edit, keep the JSON paths so the handler can use these to find the subdocument for the translation and apply it, and only allow changes to paths that include i18n. It should also be able to fill out the i18n object as languages get submitted.\n\nOther possible solutions involve:\n- Create a chat room instead of the flags. More work but the existing Bus class is built to function as a chatroom for any page on the site. And this would make sense as a usage. Would probably still need flags for related documents in the Level editor, for Systems and Components.\n- Hook up Treema to Firebase to make realtime collaboration on JSON objects. But that's crazy. Crazy awesome. \n- Switch the version control system to diffs rather than copies. They would be easier to handle and view. That would be a major project though.\n- Create a staging system. So patches would be submitted all the time but they would not be applied until... Something. Like the creator accepting them or at regular intervals.\n It seems to me that you are missing the part of the picture where a string that were already translated is updated in\nEnglish. When this happens, will you drop any transations? Keep them even if they may not fit the original anymore?\n\nAs a former leader of the Debian French translation team, I would advise you to use existing tools to tackle this issue. There is many solutions to edit po files out there, and they perfectly handle these issues (and some others). \n\nOf course, the difficulty is then to bridge the po file format and the format you are currently using to actually use the translation strings. You may want to use po4a here (but my advice is biaised, I wrote this tool myself 10 years ago).\n\nThe idea would be that you produce a en.coffee file containing all the strings in english (I'm sure you already have it), and then you use po4a to extract these strings into pot file, and to produce up to date XX.coffee files with the translations from the XX.po files edited by translators. You need to write a new driver for po4a that can deal with coffee files, but I can help if you go this way.\n\nThen, all problems of language update and everything is externalized. If you want to present a little interface to translate the po files online, that's very possible. Many similar tools exist, some free (pootle), some not (crowdin or transiflex).\n\nThat's just a suggestion here.\nMt\n I noticed that diplomats sometimes make translations errors. They translate the words correctly but in the wrong context. So when this editor gets developed it's important that they instantly see their translations they are currently working on. \n\nThey should see it as a preview how it would look on the real page(s). This way they see the complete sentence and they won't make context-related translation mistakes anymore.\n I have some limited experience with translations management, and I agree with @mquinson. Using pot files and established translations workflow is very advisable.\n\nWe  use launchpad translations for unity tweak tool, and I am very much satisfied with it. There is also a pool of Launchpad Translators whose team can be set as the review team, and they ensure good quality of our translations where no team member speaks the target language.\n\nSince codecombat already has some translation workflow in place, the only missing link is a helper script to generate pot file with all translatable strings, and to convert the translated po files back to `.coffee/.js` files, which can be accomplished by writing a simple script.\n The idea will definitely work, but I am very much biased towards the pot/po based translation system, partly because it works well and partly because it is time-tested.\n\nBut since you say this new system is mostly ready, and it also supports non-text translations, it sounds good. It would indeed be difficult to tie in the translations with a reward system if an external tool is used. These are two major use cases where the new system wins.\n\nI did not quite understand what JSON objects need to be \"translated\". You mentioned them alongside audio files in non-text objects that need translations. Can you elaborate?\n I agree with @sderickson and @nwinter on this one. Our system looks promising, and with enough effort this can really be something great. It will be really great when diplomats can just translate via our website on the fly. We already have many great translators that take time and effort do work their way through git and github. However, I'm sure that we'll reach many more translators, once they can just do their job via an editor on our website. It will also be a great test case for the patch system.\n I agree with @phanimahesh. You will certainly manage to get a great system working. I would have prefered a standard system where you improve the standard tools on need, but I understand that a fully integrated solution is also very promising.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd love if codecombat would be perfectly translated to French so that my kids can play with it. My personal feelings about the implementation is not very important.\n\nThanks a lot for this work!\n Sounds good. Good luck for the planned changes ahead. :)\n It sounds awesome!

Way better than walking throw the level stuff!\n It's very good and easier to use nice work @sderickson !\n Thanks, everyone!\n I think I found a bug in the translation interface because when i select a language from the combobox and if then I click on word to translate I need reselect the language\n If I do a translation with this tool, when/how does it go live? I'm trying to help with swedish translations.\n It goes live immediately, unless you translated something that doesn't show the translation yet (like the ThangType names only show up i18n in the new inventory and store views, which are basically done but not yet deployed). The stuff in the levels should show up right away, unless it thought it needed to submit a patch (like for a change to an existing translation) instead of just saving the change (for adding new translations).\n\nAre there some translations you think should be showing up that aren't yet?\n Yeah, it seems to work like you describe. I managed to translate first dungeon Dungeons of Kithgard. So now I can go ahead and translate the rest.\n\nOne more thing. How can I change translations of things I already translated that doesn't feel right in context?\n\nThanks!\n Found now that previous translations end up in the bottom of the list.\n  I'm going to have someone from my team look into either highlighting the whole line in red or adding some sort of icon at the end to indicate an incorrect line, in addition to the more verbose explanation at the bottom.\n Excellent, I'll get some people who are interested and get back to you so you can talk them through it a bit\n Can't we move it further up and increase it's width? I'm pretty sure the user will notice it then. \n ![sample](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6795366/2285300/f3a4e480-9fd2-11e3-9fb8-06f2593981d8.png)\n\nThis is how it would look if you pull it up, I just randomly increased the size. It can be done better and the close button has to be moved to the end of course. \n But, as an error was made, it wouldn't be a problem even if the rest of the code gets covered? Anyway the sound effect does seem like a nice idea :)\n  Now that dropping has been added to the inventory system, if you want to pick a thang up, move to a new position, and then drop the thang, the thang must have both the Collectable component added, but also the Moves component (or else the new position is never registered).\n\nShould it remain this way (which should then be documented or added as a dependency), or should the Collects component added \"pos\" as a tracked property of any thang that is dropped?\n We haven't really needed any inventory system extensions for a year, so closing this\u2013the levels I want to make don't need it.\n  With the vector artwork system, we can manipulate sprites in fun ways without having to download or generate multitudes of sprite maps. One of the key things we want to do is be able to take a given Thang and tint certain parts of it. For example, give Ogres a different skin color, or humans different colored shirts, or wizards different colored robes. There are many things that need to get done for this vision to be realized:\n1. Need a way to specify and set these values. In the Thang editor, we should be able to create color groups, where each group has a name and a set of shapes. I imagine an interface with:\n   1. one Treema column for managing groups and their names\n   2. another Treema column with a list of shapes with checkboxes for which ones are part of that color group that is selected in the first column, and\n   3. a Surface showing the thang where, if one of the left columns is selected, it's highlighting either the shapes in the selected group or the single selected shape (maybe showing the selected shape(s) fully opaque while the rest is semi-transparent). This would be in a separate tab from the main one that's there now.\n   4. Controls below the surface for testing the selected color group. So you have a hue slider which can be used to control what the color group looks like when adjusted.\n2. Get the ThangType Model to be able to take in its spriteSheet options what the colors are for the given set. That is, it could receive an options object like `{colors:{team:0}}` and that would mean the team color is red (the 0 is a hue value of [HSL](http://hslpicker.com/)). It will also incorporate these color settings with the caching system so there can be, say, blue and red tinted sprites at the same time.\n3. Hook this up to the Components/Systems and Surface. @nwinter, do you have an idea how this would go?\n  When editing a thang in the level editor:\n- Arrow keys move the selected thang\n- Arrow keys + alt rotate the selected thang\n- Maybe add a line to show the rotation of the selected thang\n\nSee the [ThangsTabView](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs_tab_view.coffee) for how it's currently set up for adjusting the position with the mouse.  The system is a bit hacky since it is not agnostic to how the systems and components for presence are structured and named. Any ideas on how to improve that would be good. Or, for now, use the same sort of system.\n Is it currently possible to rotate thangs at all?\n The rotation is in: https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/editor/level/thangs/ThangsTabView.coffee#L64-L67\n\nIt would be good to take left/right/up/down and make them move the Thangs, too. (We don't need the current left/right handlers on moveAddThangSelection.)\n  http://discourse.codecombat.com/t/facebook-login-is-broken/140\n\nFacebook login button is giving me the following error:\n\n{\n\"error\": {\n    \"message\": \"Missing client_id parameter.\",\n    \"type\": \"OAuthException\",\n    \"code\": 101\n    }\n}\nUsing Chrome 32.0.1700.68 beta-m. Not tested on other browsers/versions.\n Discourse. I'm lumping this in with transferring the Discourse and Hubot to company servers. I'm not sure this issue should be here though.\n @nwinter looks like facebook login is working fine in both discourse and codecombat. Can you please close this bug.\n  @nwinter , how did you do it? Does the collision problem still happen? I think I may have a solution.\n I just set the ground_and_air_humans and ground_and_air_ogres collision categories to not collide with each other in the Collision System and Component. I want them to collide with each other, but to dynamically check and cancel certain collisions in the collision contact listener.\n  Just a heads-up that I'm working on this problem if anyone wants to collaborate. I'm looking to incorporate SAT ( [Separating Axis Theorem](http://www.codezealot.org/archives/55) ) for the Thang.intersects method and maybe [Voronoi Regions](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/413452/Create-a-Voronoi-diagram-2-of-3) for the Thang.distance method. I'm open to suggestions though!\n @zachster01 I'd like to work with you on this. I'm new to github and to programming for video games, but I'm a quick study. Let me know how I can help. :)\n @twoducky That sounds terrific! I'm finishing up some school work over the weekend, but I'll try to be free in a few hours if you want to coordinate. I'll message you so we can work on what our plan of attack will be. Welcome to the team!\n @twoducky My apologies. It looks like there isn't a private messaging system for github. If you'd like to coordinate via email, feel free to message me at zachster01(at)gmail.com. Just replace the (at) with the @ symbol (I'm not sure if there are any bots that crawl these message boards looking for email addresses).\n @zachster01 what's your progress on this? I have actually implemented a physics engine before and my experience can come in useful here. Seems like a collision module of the physics engine is required.\n @nwinter I've finished contains() and am a case and a half away from finishing intersects(). I'll be moving on to distance() soon, but it'll have to wait until next week because I had to make last minute plans to go out of town from Thursday until Sunday. This issue is more hand written math to figure out all of the necessary quadratics than it is actual coding, but it's necessary to make sure the equations are right.\n @yangshun Sorry for the lack of updates, I was promoted at work for the new systems migration that's going underway and have been working 50-60 hour weeks on top of going to school full-time. I hope that things will die down soon, but if you want to work with @bnosrat and @twoducky, it looks like they'll be able to help more. For now I'm probably going to bow out until things die down. I look forward to coming back in the near future!\n @bnosrat could you show us what you have so far? If you don't mind I would like to work with you on it.\n I have limited computer/internet access until next week, but here's the working code for ellipse.contains(thang): http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fAxuH\nIf I manage to finish thang.intersects(thang) by Sunday, I'll post it up asap.\nIf not, both intersects and distance will have to wait until next week.\n I've added intersects. Distance is next, but it'll have to wait until next week. Please play around with what I've got and let me know if you notice any errors.\n\nPost Script: I wrote the code differently (ie more clearly and cleanly) locally, but just did a messy copy/pasta to put it into the pen. In the pen's current form, it could and should be refactored. But I'll worry about all that at the end...\n\nPost Script v2: I just realized I only did the ellipse vs rectangle case for intersects. I still have to do rectangle vs rectangle and ellipse vs ellipse.\n @nwinter @yangshun either of you had time to look at my code? im just looking for a little input. im aiming to have rectangle-rectangle intersection done today and ellipse-ellipse intersection done by tomorrow, and then i can move to distance. fyi all of these include rotation and off-origin centers. and just as before, ill refactor when its all done.\n\nquestions: the previous contains code returned false for points that fall on vertices. is this right? my code does this as well, but i can change it if falling on vertices should return true when calling the contains method. id also like to know the same for intersects as well. all things being equal, i think both should return true if a point falls on a vertex, although more so for intersects than contains.\n @nwinter http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fAxuH\n @nwinter Hey Nick, I was checking upon this issue and it seems to me pretty messy for now. I can see at least 4 links to CodePen with different states of work done and I can't see any commits related to this issue. Maybe it makes sense to introduce a little bit of structure to this topic?\n\nAnyway, I feel confident about the subject of the issue, so I gues I would be able to help out. Please, hint me with something to start from not to inrersect with other guys.\n @Snipx I did contains with rotation for all cases and I'm almost done doing intersects with rotation for all cases. You can try distance if you like?\n @bnosrat All right, to split this up, I will start from rectangle-rectangle distance.\n @nwinter @yangshun I updated my codepen (http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fAxuH) and now it includes contains with rotation for all cases, and intersects with rotation for rectangle-rectangle and ellipse-rectangle. I'm working on intersects with rotation for ellipse-ellipse now.\n\n@Snipx How is distance going?\n\nedit: My codepen needs refactoring and comments. I'll do that at the end.\n @nwinter I'm having trouble with ellipse-ellipse intersection. It's been too long since linear algebra and differential equations, so I don't remember enough of it. This link was helping me out, but I'm not sure what to do (http://yehar.com/blog/?p=2926).\n\nedit: The source code is at the bottom. I'll port it over from processing to CoffeeScript tomorrow.\n @bnosrat I'm still in process of implementing rectangle-rectangle distance. Hope to finish soon :)\n @nwinter Here are two options I can think of:\n\nOption 1: Break the ellipses down into a polygon using some sort of predetermined scheme (eg calculate one hundred steps from min x to max x, then calculate the y values for each step, and connect the points to make a polygon) and then do line-line intersection. Although it will be many operations, each operation is quick. Regardless, this may not be the smartest way. I'm just giving an example.\n\nOption 2: Port the Processing code that guy used in the link I provided into CoffeeScript. This is what I'm most likely going to try first.\n So, I have some results in implementing rectangle-rectangle distance, please, check it out:\nhttp://codepen.io/Snipx/pen/renHw\n\nI have added Line and Segment helper \"classes\", in order for these symbols to at least resemble programming code :)\n @nwinter I have reforked the last @bnosrat's pen in order to use the latest intersects and contains function(if one rectangle contains other or intersects with it then I think the distance is zero).\nI also added some new tests to cover almost all cases, I suppose. Feel free to ask me for some more if necessary.\nSo the current link is http://codepen.io/Snipx/pen/BuLzw\nHowever, I came across a strange thing during debugging and testing my implementation.\n\nSee the following lines in the link above:\n\n```\nrect1 = new Thang({x: 0, y: 0}, 8, 2, 0, \"box\", Math.PI / 100);\nlog(rect1.rectangle().vertices())\nrect2 = new Thang({x: 0, y: 8}, 8, 2, 0, \"box\", Math.PI / 100);\nlog(rect2.rectangle().vertices())\nlog(rect1.intersects(rect2))\n```\n\n.intersects returns true, which is a surprising fact for me and therefore my distance function returns 0, of course.\n@bnosrat could you look at that piece of code?\nSorry if I am wrong, it's too late in my place, but I guess these rectangles are at too different heights from each other and cannot intersect\n @nwinter Sorry, I mentioned it previously but probably forgot to notify you. Intersects returns true if it falls on a vertex. I can change it to return false in these cases. I believe contains already returns false in these cases. Also worth mentioning, I've been busy moving motorcycles and equipment for the past several days. The motorcycle shop I do coding work for, and where I work on my bikes and store my projects, lost their lease this month, so I have to move a lot of things. I hope to be done moving by the end of the week so that I can get back to programming.\n @nwinter I believe I fixed it. It was a case that one of my if statements was not conditional enough to catch, but I believe I catch all cases now.\n\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/fAxuH\n\nI still have not made any progress on ellipse-ellipse intersection. Life is just a mile a minute...\n @nwinter Yes. I did all cases for contains, and this wraps up all cases intersection except for ellipse-ellipse. I think somebody else was working on distance. I'm going to refactor and comment my pen right now.\n @nwinter Ok I refactored it a bit and added comments. I hope it all makes sense now to anybody that reads it. Here is a brief rundown:\n- [Class: LineSegment] Convenience class for line and line segment geometry\n- [Class: Ellipse] Ellipse equivalent of Rectangle\n- [Method: Rectangle.lineSegments()] Returns an array of 4 LineSegments\n- Rectangle contains point with and without rotation\n- Ellipse contains point with and without rotation\n- Rectangle-Rectangle intersection with and without rotation\n- Ellipse-Rectangle intersection with and without rotation\n- A bunch of tests in the form of log statements (I have the Mocha equivalents)\n no worries. i've sort of been exploring new technologies on my own. i just\nbought a domain and started development on my own site/app in node with\nexpress and angular that i deployed on heroku, just because i wanted to\nexpose myself to new [to me] technologies. i just finished making all of\nthe front end technologies i want to work with work well together. i'll be\nspending the rest of the weekend making a landing page, and then i'll be\nmoving on to back end technologies like passport, mongoose, and connect.\nafterwards i plan on playing with scala/akka and/or shark/spark on aws ec2.\n\n## \n\nYou can't teach a hammer to love nails.\n\nOn 27 March 2014 17:23, Nick Winter notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Sorry @bnosrat https://github.com/bnosrat, it's proving to be a bit\n> tricky to find a big batch of time to get this integrated into the system,\n> since the major version change to the Physical Component needs to be very\n> well tested, it being the first major version change that we have done so\n> far-not all the versioning system is built for it.

I've finally had a day to merge everything together, complete the refactoring, add tests, and migrate all the levels to take the new distance calculation methods into account. Everything can happen in the main repo now instead of Codepen.\n\nThere are a few TODOs left in [ellipse.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/ellipse.coffee) and [rectangle.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/rectangle.coffee) where ellipse-related distance and [ellipse-ellipse intersection](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/lib/world/ellipse.coffee#L155-L155) methods haven't been implemented yet. If anyone wants to take a crack at those, that's the last thing we need before we can close this. Probably translating the code from [this blog post](http://yehar.com/blog/?p=2926) for the ellipse-ellipse intersection case would be the way to go there. @schmatz expressed interest today, but it's up for grabs.\n\nTo work on it, just add test cases to [ellipse.spec.coffee](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/test/app/lib/world/ellipse.spec.coffee), then open [/test/lib/world](http://localhost:3000/test/lib/world) and try to make them pass.\n After doing quite a bit of digging and maths, the few remaining methods might not be worth it to implement if the current approximations are \"good enough.\" In specific, there's no practical analytic solution to those problems, so root finding or some other iterative approximation is necessary. While certainly doable, the cost of computation is high (at least in comparison to the other geometry tests). If there's enough desire for them still, I'll implement them and you can decide if/when to use them. \n huzzah!\n Seems I spoke to soon. I believe I've found an analytic solution.\n  In current browsers, a start would be to isolate the code doing something like:\n\n``` js\nwith(newContext){\n  eval(playerCode)\n}\n```\n\n(yeah, I know, 3 lines of JS and I use both `with` and `eval` :-). This part obviously can't be in strict mode, but can and should be isolated in its own file)\n\nIn `newContext`, you put all the global things you want the code to have access to and not more (wrap your APIs into read-only versions if necessary).\nIn `newContext`, you need to set all free variables targeted by the player's code. You can find a superset of this set [the same way Caja does](http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/ses/atLeastFreeVarNames.js).\n  I've been thinking about this.. What do you think is a good way to detect when to trigger the pickup animation? One way would be checking to see if the inventory has grown from the last time we checked. And that'd be another update method in app/lib/surface/CocoSprite.coffee. But is there a better way?\n We haven't really needed any inventory system extensions for a year, so closing this\u2013the levels I want to make don't need it.\n  I'm working on this issue.\n I need some help with this issue.\ncombat.Arrow already has setAction 'die' and act true in its update function, which sets its action to die. The die state is displayed if action.Acts component is added to the Arrow thang, but an unexpected shadow(?) appears under the dead arrow sprites.\nShould I refactor that and move this setAction functionality into a chooseAction function?\n You understood everything right. \"die\" is already working if you add action.Acts to the Arrow object.\n(like on my level: http://codecombat.com/editor/level/kgymap)\n I've made it.\nThe shadow disappears when the arrow hits the ground.\nI'll make a pull request.\nhttps://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/pull/687\n  Hey there! I've been looking into this issue for like 5 hours in a row today.\n1) Currently, when you switch Arrow's maxSpeed, it does not travel significantly slower. Instead, it just truncates the maximum attack range and that's it.\n2) I don't understand why it happens, but arrow tower disrespects it's max range:\n![aoe_ignore](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6823298/2493334/f5f242fe-b28e-11e3-8487-05ef332fea3d.png)\n3) I've reimplemented (http://paste.ubuntu.com/7140941/) combat.Arrow.launch so it shoots at 45 degree angle when possible, that actually looks good - arrows emanating from arrow tower travel slow, try it yourself. The 2) is still there, however. The major downside here is that the locomotive force of an arrow is significantly lower, so it doesn't hit ogres much. Also the lack of speed now gives a window to dodge the bullet. Overall: you can't complete Zone of Danger with this!\n\nSo you can't just migrate to different arrow speed that easily. At least, when affecting all levels. Maybe do this in some want-to-be-looking-good ones?\nI'll work out changes to updateRotation and updateScale methods in CocoSprite in order to arc properly, then test it against my implementation of combat.Arrow.launch, to ensure it works nice when arrows actually do move in  large and visible arcs. \n\nPS by the way, on the screenshot, I did not declare enemy, but it still works and shows victory. That's because I'm always attacking enemies[0] actually. This is a poor solution and must not pass.\n Glad you liked!\nAfter some more hours of trial-end-error, I've come up with a solution for arrows so they actually point along the arc, check this out, for example:\n![example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6823298/2494463/cecfaeae-b2c6-11e3-9a47-6dda4b59c07e.png)\nThis is highly ad-hoc, because it works only with my combat.Arrow.launch and there are empirical constants involved. Tell me what we can do with that. I've pull requested in case you need my code, because it's 00:30 here in Russia and I'm going to sleep soon.\n\nBy the way, how can I update my DB when I already have one? Mongorestore errors that it can't add data cause of unique index, because it (obviously) interferes with existing data. I suppose there's another command to do that?\n Great! I hope that artisans will take this feature into account.\nOne can always change visual effects to fit the desired result by managing constants in updateRotation. For example, if you need less curving on a straight path, you change\nMath.max(factor / 90, 0.4) \nto something like\nMath.max(factor / 90, 0.2).\nIn case of any questions, feel free to ask me! (it is addressed to anyone who wishes to make this more beatiful)\n \"that only works if the arrow is shooting from a position with equal z to its target\" - not correct. \nNotice that in calculateArcVelocity we take the difference of pos.z and end.z: the denominator under Math.sqrt is distance - (targetPos.z - pos.z). Consider the following picture:\n![example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/6823298/2504245/e79b865a-b38a-11e3-9faf-0bac0e4faf10.png)\nDenote d = targetPos.z - pos.z\n1) the upper case is trivial: d = 0. Here we have roughly the same angle as when we shooted out, because the elevation time equals the descendence time (and, therefore, velocity.z is the same at endpoints). \n2) the lower-left case: d < 0 (target lower than shooter). In this case, when we subtract d from distance, we get _higher_ value of denominator. Which leads us to initial velocity.z _smaller_ than in case 1. So when we calculate the curve, it _is_ smaller, which is natural, because we want to shoot more horizontally. Moreover, the descendence time is much greater than the ascendance - so velocity.z is highly negative, and more at absolute value than initial. So we get very steep slope, which is natural too (look at the picture - it's very close to 90 degrees).\n3) the lower-right case: d > 0. Here we have denominator _lower_ than in case 1, so the initial speed is higher => higher velocity.z stands for higher slope. And the descendence time is so small (the arrow must 'climb' with it's high initial speed to some height, then descend slightly), that at the end arrow is barely curved. Which is, again, natural. \n\nDon't get me wrong: the code in combat.Arrow stands for 45 degree angle. But the hack I did on calculating arrow curve by looking at it's velocity.z is actually working independent of that (it's just an effect we see on the surface), with the help of gravity. Math and common sence prove it to be right.\n Pleasant to see that you could match your desires with my solution!\nConcerning 45 instead of 90:\nmy original reasoning was that if you fire perfectly to the left, with the target having same z-coordinate as shooter, you should see the 45 degree arc at the start and -45 at the end (because combat.Arrow.launch was written with 45 in mind). That should happen when 'xFactor' (which handles position to camera) is fixed at 1 and 'zFactor' is 1 (or very close) at the start and -1 (or close value, same as at start) at the end point. But when z-coordinates are not equal, zFactor is not the same at endpoints, for example if end speed exceeds start speed, zFactor can come above 1 and that will result in > 45 degree arc.\nThese reasoning works if zFactor equals to velocity.z.current / 'some common value of velocity.z.start', which I was trying to simulate with velocity.z.current / 12.\n  Just a warning: jsdares' implementation is rather comprehensive, in fact, I think I spent most of the time working on jsdares just to make this work. But the most advanced features (time scrubbing, code scrubbing) are actually not used by most people. This might be because for the simpler puzzles they are not really necessary, but also because they might be too hard to use.\n\nI still believe that just having all kinds of data (yay, Aether!) is great for trying out different visualisations. Inspecting specific variables might be a great one to start with. A visualisation that I _think_ works well for jsdares is visualising method calls by highlighting corresponding elements on the canvas. Just be careful -- this may be a great time-sink as chances are that you won't get the great debugger you're hoping for on first try. But it might well be worth it, too. :-)\n Sweet, looks good! Keep us posted on any user testing or other results about this, I'm very curious to hear if and how learners use these controls. :)\n\n[And, in any case, keep up the great work with CodeCombat, awesome to see your open approach]\n Looks great. I guess we all know from using debugging tools that this is very valuable. This solves a real problem reported by users, so that's good!\n\nJust want to reiterate what I said earlier: would love to hear about user testing results! The scrubbable timeline didn't work too well in jsdares (see also https://github.com/codecombat/aether/issues/10), so it's critical to test how learners actually use this. Might also be worthwhile to just prototype/hack different visualisations (this one, step messages, breakpoints, jumping to function calls when clicking a function, showing the flow through a program a la Learnable Programming, etc) and test if they work before fully implementing them.\n :+1:\n @nwinter  The debugging hover tool is very useful for me.  But I also add a lot of variables to \"this\", and when I hover over them, it says \"this.myvar is undefined\".   Naturally, the variables I add are the ones most in need of debugging, so it would be very very helpful if the hover could show the variables that have been added to \"this\".\n @schmatz this relates to what you've been working on recently.\n Any progress on the debugger? This feature would make a huge difference in the ability of students to self study.\n We just shipped the interpreter, so now it should be a lot more performant to inspect variable state than the hacky method we were using before, and it'll actually do scoping correctly and all that stuff. We will still need to improve the UX a lot, though, before it will be helpful to beginners.\n\nThe current state of the code: it's turned off [here](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/views/play/level/tome/SpellView.coffee#L640-L640), and it now needs to be updated to work with the way that the interpreter reads variable state. @basicer can advise on what needs to be done there. Then we'll have to fix whatever rust it's gathered from being turned off for so long and design a new, simpler user interface for it.\n  Yeah with Internet Explorer 11 I don't have the problem, I'll try to simulate it on Internet explorer 9 tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. \n  Create a system for defining, listing and enforcing all events going through Backbone.Mediator in CodeCombat. Read up on [Subscriptions](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/Events%2C-subscriptions%2C-shortcuts) and [JSON-Schema](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/wiki/JSON-Schema) for this issue.\n\nAll notifications going through Backbone.Mediator only allow one argument: an object. In practice, though, these objects should follow certain structures, and could use some explaining.\n\nDesign a way to list events going through Backbone.Mediator and a JSON Schema defining the objects that they pass around. This could be a single file which is an object of subscription names to JSON schemas, or a folder of these files, all of which one way or another are fed to a modified version of Backbone.Mediator which runs tv4 validation on event objects to make sure they conform with their definitions.\n\nThis listing would be used to:\n\n1) Build some sort of docs that could be referenced for Archmages trying to use these subscriptions.\n2) Run sanity checks, at least during development (possibly not in production?) to make sure event arguments are being structured correctly and help debug issues.\n3) In the Level Editor for scripts, for choosing a trigger for a script and for emitting notifications as a result of scripts (for example when pressing buttons).\n The project I forked off of the original Mediator is called [Validated Backbone Mediator](https://github.com/rubenvereecken/Validated-Backbone-Mediator). Schemas are named after the channel they are supposed to verify and can be added to the global `Backbone.Mediator` by calling its `addSchemas` method. For the moment that method expects a map of the form in which it keeps its own schemas.\n\nI also have a CoCo branch running in which I integrate it. All schemas are simply dropped into the `schemas` folder, in which currently only the file [`subscriptions.coffee`](https://github.com/rubenvereecken/codecombat/blob/backbone_mediator/app/schemas/subscriptions.coffee) lives (do check it out for examples). This might have to be broken down into more files but I've left room for such refactorings. The schemas are added to Backbone.Mediator inside CoCo's `init`. The whole setup is very much like the locale files, if that helps you get a picture.\n\nIt needs some work to allow for cross schema references but I think we're off to a good start here in order to formalize and gather information surrounding the most important communication channel behind CodeCombat. I'll probably send a Pull Request soon, to get a feel of what it'll be like.\n Sure thing, so that you can reference the issue from the long awaited Archmage email Scott wanted to write. The roots of this issue on itself have been taken care of.\nIf you want I'll open the new issue as soon as you close off this one, in case you don't feel like it yourself.\n  Need a way for users to modify permissions of any given document. Something like the share modal in Google Docs, where you can add and remove individuals and set permissions to read, write and owner. This would include:\n\n1) Creating the modal view logic and basic layout.\n2) Create an endpoint for taking a username string and returning the id of the user. The permissions list needs an id in order to target a specific user, but users will only know the username, so there needs to be a way to go from one to the other.\n3) Set up the modal to use this endpoint, be able to receive a list of permissions and return a modified list of permissions.\n\nHighly recommend using [Treema](https://github.com/codecombat/treema) to handle building the interface for editing the list of permissions. It's used throughout the rest of the site, and will handle a lot of the grunt work like adding and removing entries. You would only need to implement a node for editing a single row and tying into the user lookup endpoint.\n What permissions?  Sorry, i just don't understand.\n\nTJ\n I suppose you mean like sharing the code while playing a level? Or do you mean in the level editor? Or both :)\n @sderickson Admins can now use the ModelModals for this. Do you think we should hook it up in more places to be better able to edit the permissions like this?\n Yes, although it still won't be easy unless we make users searchable. Ruben\nis interested in making them named which will set us on that path.\nOn Jun 26, 2014 9:13 AM, \"Nick Winter\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> @sderickson https://github.com/sderickson Admins can now use the\n> ModelModals for this.

Anywhere on the site, the developer could click a button or press a shortcut and open a Developer Tools like interface in a separate window which includes:\n\n1) Current view and subviews. They could be clicked to highlight what element that view represents. Show the module path for each one.\n2) Current instances of other classes and models and collections in existence.\n3) Events, subscriptions and keyboard shortcuts currently active, and what they call.\n4) Active log of events, subscriptions and keyboard shortcuts as they happen.\n5) Regular updating of all these as they change.\n\nThis could be used to:\n\n1) Edify an Archmage on what is going on with a given view. See what files are involved and how they're involved and how they communicate with one another.\n2) Debug issues involving tearing down objects and views and investigating memory leaks.\n @sderickson @nwinter  I would be willing to try this out, I am submitting the proposal for this project in GSoC as we speak. Hopefully I will be able to work on this if you like my proposal.\n  Right now, versions pages for versioned documents load the full documents. Particularly large version pages like the [one for the Rescue Mission level](http://codecombat.com/editor/level/rescue-mission/versions) fail to load because it's trying to load a huge number of large documents.\n\nHave the system instead download just the parts of the documents required: the version object, the commit message, the name and the id. The function which serves versions for all documents is in /server/handlers/Handler.coffee:versions.\n\n1) Edit this handler to return just those properties needed.\n2) Make sure all versions pages work with this new system (search for versions.coffee files in /app)\n Handler.coffee is located in /server/commons/Handler.coffee.\n I jumped this issue but found that loading versions was already quite efficient. An example response is the following:\n\n```\n[ { slug: 'tiny2',\n    name: 'Tiny2',\n    created: Mon Mar 10 2014 08:53:37 GMT+0100 (CET),\n    version: { isLatestMinor: true, isLatestMajor: true, minor: 0, major: 0 },\n    _id: 531d6f81baf1b1290f2f9534 } ]\n```\n\nThe only thing possibly superfluous is _slug_ but I'm guessing that's not too much of a bottleneck.\n\nSince all and only essential properties are returned, with no documents, this issue can be closed.\n I checked it out, it's not mongoose specific. Even if you tell Mongo to project, it seems like internally it's still loading the full data and take up all the Mongo resources. I tested by running this command on the mongo client:\n\n```\ndb.levels.find({original:ObjectId('52d97ecd32362bc86e004e87')}, {name:1}).sort({created:-1})\n```\n\nYou get the same error:\n\n```\nerror: {\n\"$err\" : \"Runner error: Overflow sort stage buffered data usage of 33637240 bytes exceeds internal limit of 33554432 bytes\",\n\"code\" : 17144\n}\n```\n  We could migrate those headers to be part of the template instead of as a property in the class. Then they'd be with their translated brethren. We don't need these titles to be in the View logic, right?\n Localization Lists:\n    + editor.new_component_title\n    + editor.save_view_title\n    + editor.add_system_title\n    + contact.contact_modal_title\n    + login.login_modal_title\n    + recover.recover_account_title\n    + save.save_version_title\n    + signup.create_account_title\n    + modal.wizard_settings_title\n  Ok I'm doing this write now :)\n **Question**: for [play web page](http://www.codecombat.com/play) we have all these tutorials. They all have a name, id, describition, etc... You use the template file: [play.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/play.jade) for this. How can i make sure I use **data-i18n** for all of these? As the code is just generic code, and doesn't say anything about one specific tutorial. Or is it for cases like this impossible?\n Sometimes there is code like **_#thangs-treema(title=\"Double click to configure a thang\")**_ in [thangs_jab.jade](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/master/app/templates/editor/level/thangs_tab.jade) on line 3. I tried putting a **data-i18n** there next to title, but it doesn't seem to work. So is it possible to provide a **data--i18n** tag for code like this, and if yes, how?\n Regarding spaces: What I do is just make sure the spaces between the 2 concatenated localization strings is separate and is not part of the localization string.

[For example](https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/blob/f74a1529427da8eede85b35c9de1a16570ba7a47/app/views/TestView.coffee#L27).\n Current system is working pretty well: website i18n strings are in GitHub, in separate .coffee files loaded as needed, and database content has its /i18n interface.\n  I think I'll take up modifying some of the pages to look at least not broken on mobile, but is there any prescribed approach to the mobile solution at the moment, or should I just go add the mobile functionality the way I believe would be best implemented, and then changes can come from there.\n The most likely solution given what we already have would be to use Bootstrap's [fluid grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#fluidGridSystem). But go ahead and do what you think would be best!\n Ok, yeah that was basically the plan. My personal website is built on a modified bootstrap grid, so using that for the mobile here will be fine. So far planning everything out in my head it should be relatively straight forward to get most of it look at the very least not broken on mobile.\n The way bootstrap grid works is under a certain size it breaks down, or at least all of the implementations I've used. But, to put it short, basically the gird is usually for screens greater than a certain size.\n\nLook at the levels page to see that behavior of the grid just stopping working. But one of the biggest problems is that elements can actually end up being larger than the grid says they should, which can totally mess things up.\n\nBut yeah, once again it basically just is adding media quires to fix certain behaviors. Like for the homepage it will mean just adding a media query to define all of the mobile behavior.\n I think making the move to Bootstrap 3 (https://github.com/codecombat/codecombat/issues/89) should be prioritized before writing too many media queries. The further the dig into 2.3.2 might make digging out more difficult.\n I'm just going to make a quick, and temporary solution on the main pages that are likely to be visited on mobile. Upgrading to Bootstrap 3 will be a more comprehensive update, so this is the type of thing that can be used as a bandage, until the migration to Bootstrap 3 is complete.\n Example page to fix for mobile: #131 \n Okay, you know what. I've changed my mind, I think I'm going to do as mcfarljw recommended and help do some work towards migrating to Bootstrap 3. I don't think it would make digging out any harder as he mentions because it would be a simple matter of just removing the mobile fixes, and then fixing them the right way. But it would mean having to do all of the mobile fixes twice.\n @TomSteinbrecher do you guys have a branch put together for this? I'd be happy to help.\n Wish we did, although if you want to start working on this yourself go for it. I'm a full time student so I don't have tons of time work on stuff, and recently I've been wrangling with my Ubuntu install more than coding because of some weird bug maxing out CPU usage. Although I should have that fixed tomorrow, but yeah totally go for it if you want to. Although as you said it might be a good idea to set up a branch strictly for this.\n A user commented today that they tried the site on their iPad and they either didn't see our warning, or ignored it, tried the game, got booted back to the homepage, and contacted us. So yeah, would be great to make it more clear that we're not supporting mobile.\n https://app.asana.com/0/15388757953815/20686183437394\n I call it good enough with my recent work to make the homepage look a'ight on small screens.\n  Do we use a 3rd party API for audio?\n Only this: http://www.createjs.com/Docs/SoundJS/modules/SoundJS.html\n\nBut that's really for simplified loading and playing. For reversing or otherwise manipulating sound, we'd want to do something like this:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9874167/how-can-i-play-audio-in-reverse-with-web-audio-api\n Also, SoundJS has an example of how they get the Audio API context through their preloader here:\n\nhttp://www.createjs.com/Demos/SoundJS/MusicVisualizer.html\n  ++1, should be really implemented, it is very upsetting to write my attack snippet every stage for example.\n  I think the autocomplete box in jsdares worked pretty well, I have seen most novice learners use it without any problems. Most people start typing \"robot.\" by example, and then see the autocomplete box. Some people copy/paste lines from the example, but eventually they discover the autocomplete box too.\n\nIt's a flexible interface for discovering new methods (not just the ones in an example). It also scales nicely to real-world programming, although there autocomplete boxes are often not as nice (no preview, or no context-awareness) ;-)\n\nIf you're going to do this, I would like to suggest doing it a bit better than jsdares and show some more information, e.g. little icons (like Bret Victor proposes), or named arguments instead of just numbers, or small method descriptions.\n Yeah many people expect this, including me. A lot of people already get frustrated when nothing happens after pressing CTRL+Space ( a code assist combination in many IDE's ). so maybe show a message box (maybe just when you  do CTRL+SPACE) that tells that the auto complete function is not yet implemented but will be done soon.\n It would be enough to allow to click-insert spells from available spells interface. Right now it's tedious to write commands, therefore inherently not fun for my kids :/.\n @dkundel has been working on this with [Zatanna](https://github.com/dkundel/zatanna).\n BTW I think we can close this issue? We got the autocomplete and the click to insert snippets part.\n 1. Is kind of difficult to fix. I have it in mind but for now the quickest (appropriate) fix would be to actually not prefix with `this.` and I left out the semicolon because sometimes you want to have multiple statement in the same line (i.e. in an `if` statement). The problem is that some people actually reference `this` as `$this` or similar which gives it a different degree of complexity also with respect of parsing and understanding the code. The question is how much benefit this would give. Alternatively we could wrap the `this.` as an argument using the `${1:this.}` syntax and this way you can quickly remove the statement.\n2. I'll look into that. I need to copy paste the default code again and override it similar as I did it with other parts of the ace code but it should be doable.\n3. Shall be fixed. Just need to find the `z-index` of the spell palette\n4. If I end up copy and pasting the code from ace to Zatanna then I can add this as well. For now I only included the code that leaves out information from the commented section to be offered as autocomplete suggestions.\n5. I thought I excluded them already but I'll add it.\n  I'll investigate making a HTML/CSS fix to this when I look in to the other issue on the contributor page. The better fix for this is most certainly on the HTML/CSS side because applying a fix in script would be more of a bandage than an actual fix.\n  Fixed. aeaeb84\n  One possibility would be to have a \"Guide\" character who is at the start\npoint of the level and when clicked on brings up the guide text.\n\nOn Wed, Jan 1, 2014 at 1:05 PM, Nick Winter notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> [image: screenshot 2014-01-01 10 55 48]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1829997/917ac5ba-7316-11e3-975a-ece1c783491c.png\n> \n> [image: screenshot 2014-01-01 10 58 09]https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/99704/1830000/c6e2006a-7316-11e3-83aa-6e0a40f25f01.png\n> \n> In UX testing, in support chats, everywhere--no one sees or thinks to\n> click that Guide button.

However if that is currently unfeasible I would suggest that a static location in one of the four corners is the best option, following along with the general color themes of the game. Second, While I agree that getting rid of the grid lines would clean up the look a lot, I think that keeping the border numbers is still quite helpful.\n Seems like this is still an issue. It took me quite some time to realize that there is a coordinate displayed along with the cursor. I like @mlewisno idea with a fixed dedicated position for the coordinate. This way if we design it the correct way, i.e. don't reset the value of the coordinate too fast, the user could keep the mouse at a coordinate and then move the mouse back to the code and still see the last coordinate.\n\nI think this is also more comfortable than clicking an extra button ever time that might not even be close to the the code or the coordinate (for example in the bottom next to 'zoom'). \n\n@nwinter what do you think about it? I would look into it tomorrow.\n Is it possible to detect when a Coordinate is actually required in code? This way, when the user types _this.moveXY(_ we could trigger ON the CoordinateDisplay. Then, the user can click on the specific coordinate in the map to insert it into the code.\n\nNow that auto-complete is being implemented, I think this should be possible.\n Have you thought about a shortcut that grabs the coordinate under the cursor and pastes it at the caret in the editor. I know you're short on shortcuts but it would improve usability by a lot.\n A shortcut would improve usability for experienced user who are used to shortcuts in general. However beginners are not too used to it and rather mouse oriented if it's not about entering the text/code itself but rather accessing functionality. I like the idea however.\n Seems like a cool idea. We could change the cursor to a little flag or so and I think pressing Shift is not a too difficult key-combination even for beginners. I would love to give this a shot however how do I communicate in the best way between the two views for the game and the editor to get the coordinates?\n Okay cool. Will give it a shot.\n  Hi. I would like to work on this bug, would someone please assign this to me?\n You can't be assigned an issue if you are not a collaborator of the repo.\n Hi everyone. \n\nI tried to approach this issue and came up with a solution. Now I would like to know your opinion. I consulted some non-programmer friends that occasionally use things such as CodeCombat to learn programming. The feedback that I got from them was mostly confusion about the yellow colored lines and less about the actual `executing` line. After getting this feedback I came up with the following approach: \n\n![screenshot-coco](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1505101/2328510/6993a47a-a400-11e3-8fee-b01f0340d675.png)\n\nThe check marks next to the `executed` lines clearly highlights that this code was already executed. Additionally to that I changed the color of the `executing` line to green, added an animation (from Twitter Bootstraps progress-bar) and made the color span the whole line instead of just the code. This shows better the activity that is going on there and both colors as well as gutter images support each other in getting a meaning.\n\nPlease let me know what you think and I'll submit a pull request.\n Maybe we can just tell the player that the arrow means \"now executing\" when, say, he goes through the tutorial and whenever he hovers the arrow out of curiosity? @dkundel 's proposal sure is very visible, but spamming heavy highlights and ticks on everything is kind of over-stimulating.\n\nI suppose it isn't always possible to make something intuitive to the very end, and educating the players a bit seems like an easy and effective way out.\n An optimal UX shouldn't actually require to explain too much so I disregarded that option although it would be a possibility. \nI tried to reduce the highlight of the executed lines to a minimal and made the check marks adapt better to the background. I tried to kind of stick to the style that was started with marking the comments on the side. My current view looks like this:\n\n![coco-screenshot-2](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1505101/2335058/e2008a8e-a47f-11e3-8d9e-1a5c1015373e.png)\n I see. Keeping the changes and just going back to highlighting the executing statement it would look the following:\n\n![coco-text-highlight](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1505101/2338468/9d02d94e-a4a9-11e3-900c-670c27f4d954.png)\n\nI think it would work but it's harder to see the actual slow moving animation. I could increase the color by setting a higher alpha value which hover would make statements written in light blue (i.e. comments) harder to read.\n Would work for me but I tried it on three different screens for some it's hard to see the `this`. It depends on how intensive your colors are. In general I think we should give it a shot and see how users react on it.\n How would a light red look like for the `this` statement?\n Thanks! Looks good :) \n  The current implementation is rebuilding and replacing the DOM there with every additional character, which is probably why it's so slow. Here are a handful of solution ideas.\n1. Have canvas animate the text instead. Downside would be losing HTML formatting, so many things like inserting images and text coloring and all that fun stuff would need to be somehow re-implemented or lost.\n2. Create some sort of white 'covering' element which is gradually removed from each line, making it look like the text is showing up but is actually just being unhidden. Then the DOM won't change, just the style of some covering element. The problem with that is it would be tricky to line things up and always get it right.\n3. Set the text area to use CSS ellipsis and then gradually expand the area. The problem there is how to break down the text into independent lines that can be expanded from left to right independently, and do you want ellipses in there. That would also add one word at a time instead of one character at a time.\n4. Get the animator to keep up with the clock by adding more than one character if it's falling behind. It would still be performance intensive, but it would yield to other things one the going gets rough and catch up later like the canvas does as well.\n5. Ditch it. Downside there is it's useful for getting players to see that there is text, all that movement. And it's kinda cool. But really it's not necessary, and once all the characters have moving portraits when talking, the moving text will be less important.\n  The development server should be able to just download a copy of the relevant parts of the latest production database whenever it wants, so the production database should probably have a regular (hourly?) cron set up to make a dump of that available for download.\n  Scott and I were thinking about how it would be awesome if we had a single command people could run (like with curl) that would clone the repo and install all the dev dependencies and everything. This would make it much easier for novices to get involved.\n\nThe second part would be to consolidate the coco-brunch, coco-dev-server, coco-mongodb, and maybe coco-test-server and coco-server-test-runner scripts into one script that could be run from a single terminal, so that people don't have to set up five different terminals to get going. We'd strip down any extra logging from coco-dev-server, coco-test-server, and coco-server-test-runner so that the stdout from five things didn't get overwhelming.\n So we talked this over and decided consolidating the scripts would be best, as well as using Vagrant instead of supporting windows natively.\n  Right now it just says 'Page Not Found'. Ideas for improvement:\n- Add some good artwork\n- Build a chaotic, surreal level and have it play on a surface embedded in the 404.\n\nThe 404 view is in /app/views/not_found.coffee.\n This looks interesting. I'd like to know what sort of view is expected. \n I'd just stick to Scott's guidelines above, propose an idea, and then we can either give you the artwork to make it happen, or if you have all you need, submit a pull request and we'll take a look :smile: \n Actually since this issue was created, our artist has drawn some assets for us, so we'll just put those in there.\n Oh, that makes stuff easy :)\n Is this issue still open or is anybody working on it?\n I'll put in a pull request by tonight :)\n", "text_all_count": 162129, "text_word_token": ["When", "typing", "any", "text", "into",
