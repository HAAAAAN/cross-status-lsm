[{"repo": "filebrowser", "type": "elite", "title": "", "number of text": 873, "text": "  @glinuz, please answer the questions suggested in the template/form, in order to allow other users understand and reproduce your issue.  @rhjmoore, unfortunately, this seems to be a tricky issue to triage. On the one hand, you can try to reproduce the problem in a virtual/portable machine, such as a session in play-with-docker. That will allow other people to further analyze it. On the other hand, in order to get additional and specific log messages, you will need to add `log.Println()` instructions to the codebase and build filebrowser yourself.\r\n\r\nJust in case, did you already check the console log in the browser?  Thanks @dtwilliams10 :heart:\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue because I have manually copied the content to hub.docker.com. Let's continue the conversation in #528.  Hi @techie879! Please, see #301 and #489.  Hi @dodekeract! Can you please tell us which version of filebrowser are you using? It'd be great if you could also paste the log of filebrowser. If you do start the container as a daemon, you can get the log with `docker log <container_name>`. Also, I think that `docker-compose --verbose up` might show it. @alx I just tried:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndocker pull filebrowser/filebrowser\r\ndocker run --rm -it -p 5555:80 filebrowser/filebrowser --auth.method='none'\r\n```\r\nand it works as expected. Can you provide more info about your context? How are you setting the authentication method?\r\n\r\n@rhjmoore, AFAIK there is no verbosity option for the log. What info do you expect to be logged which is not?  > it'd be nice if I had the permissions required to close or label issues as I dig through the backlog\r\n\r\nYou can comment on those you are interested to fix, and we will close or relabel them correspondingly. Indeed, we rarely take actions without double approval. That is, even if an issue is to be closed, we comment there to ensure that it is solved. Then, if no reply is received in around a week, it is closed. However, if the issue is old, and no maintainer replied to it previously, we wait longer as the OP might have forgotten about it and some more time might be needed to come back.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, ATM we can read and respond to issues/questions, but *new features won't be created and deep bugs might be hard to be fixed*. So, it'd be great if you contributed to these topics. @dtwilliams10, as @hacdias suggested, [bugs](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Abug) have the highest priority. However, since you are not familiar with neither the languages nor the code, triaging can help you. With triaging I mean trying to reproduce issues reported by users. Doing so will let you gain insight into the build procedure and into the wide use space. Of course, it is also useful for us, in order to better label the issues. If you do so, please reply in the corresponding issue telling if you could reproduce it or, in case you couldn't, asking for additional info.\r\n\r\nAlso, please read https://github.com/filebrowser/community.\r\n\r\n@hugomassing looking forward for those fixes ;)  Thanks @chinglinwen :+1:   It is fixed now. For some arbitrary reason related to curl, the last execution of https://travis-ci.com/filebrowser/docker-dev had failed. It was not started again because it is scheduled weekly. I triggered manually and now filebrowser/dev is based on go1.11.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a problem with yarn: https://travis-ci.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/builds/82754910. I don't know why it cannot connect to the yarn/npm registry. I can reproduce it locally, so it is not a travis issue.  I took the proposal by @dtwilliams10 as a reference, and I updated the descriptions of the two repos:\r\n\r\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser/\r\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/dev/\r\n\r\nHowever, I could not add the icon/logo, because it seems that the only option is to do it through gravatar. @hacdias, can you please register filebrowserbot there with its email account?\r\n\r\n@dtwilliams10, @bdito, feel free to propose any additional refinement to the current descriptions.  @minhohihi I can't open that website. It gives connection timeout.  I just tested it, and it works for me:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndocker pull filebrowser/filebrowser\r\ndocker run --rm -it -p 5555:8000 filebrowser/filebrowser -b /admin -p 8000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, browse `localhost:5555` or `curl localhost:5555/admin`. @bkanuka, you are ok. I did not replace it properly in all the javascript sources. As you say, `BaseURL` should be replaced with `baseurl`.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the fix, please see [filebrowser/community](https://github.com/filebrowser/community). There you will find instructions about how to build the frontend first, then the backend and, last, test it all. For a quicker path, see https://github.com/filebrowser/community/blob/master/development.md. @bkanuka we do not provide a file that does everything at once. But we provide a development docker image (`filebrowser/dev`) that can be used to build both the frontend and the backend, without installing any dependency in the host:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nUSE_DOCKER=\"true\" ./build/build_all.sh\r\ndocker build -t filebrowser/filebrowser .\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/filebrowser/community/blob/master/development.md#docker-and-shell.\r\n\r\nSo, you can use `build_all.sh` and extend the reference Dockerfile to a multistage dockerfile if you wish:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM filebrowser/dev AS build\r\nRUN git clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser && \\\r\n cd filebrowser && \\\r\n ./build/build_all.sh && \\\r\n  mv filebrowser /tmp\r\n\r\nFROM scratch\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=filebrowser/dev /tmp/filebrowser /filebrowser\r\nCOPY --from=filebrowser/dev /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\r\n\r\nVOLUME /tmp\r\nVOLUME /srv\r\nEXPOSE 80\r\n\r\nCOPY Docker.json /.filebrowser.json\r\n\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/filebrowser\"]\r\n```  Duplicate of #416. I updated the title of 416 because it wasn't very clear. Let's have this discussion there!  @helloray , in order to discuss the implementation and (hopefully) get help from other contributors, please open a PR in the corresponding repo. If only frontend sources are modified, the repo is [filebrowser/frontend](https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend). If it requires some other modification in the backend, open another issue in this repo, and link both of them.  Thanks @hugomassing. Could you just rebase, as @1138-4EB said? Hi @ChrisGet, v1.10.0 was released on 2018-08-16, and this fix was added on 2018-08-22. So it will be available in the next release.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have it now, you need to build filebrowser from sources. See https://github.com/filebrowser/community, [build](https://github.com/filebrowser/community/blob/master/builds.md) and [development](https://github.com/filebrowser/community/blob/master/development.md).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use docker image `filebrowser/filebrowser:latest`, which is always built with the latest commit in branch master. So, the fix should be already applied there. > Sorry I found the documentation. I'll try the docker method. Thanks.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any problem with it. The image should be automatically downloaded, so you just need to run a container.\r\n\r\n> Do you have any idea when the next release will be published?\r\n\r\nThat is actually hard to reply at now. If you have a look at https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/commits/master, you will see that, indeed, we released `v1.10.0` a month ago because we were going to introduce some breaking changes (#506). Therefore, the next release should be `v2.0.0`, according to https://semver.org/. However, golang just released version 1.11 (#530), which introduces some changes about how packages/dependencies are handled: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#semantic-import-versioning:\r\n\r\n> (...) In contrast, a package that has opted in to modules must include the major version in the import path for any imported v2+ modules)\r\n> There are two ways to release a v2 or higher module version. Using the example of creating a v2.0.0 release, the two options are:\r\n> - Update the go.mod file to include a /v2 at the end of the module path. Tag the release with v2.0.0.\r\n>    - To avoid confusion with this approach, consider putting the v2.*.* commits on a separate v2 branch.\r\n>    - If instead you have been previously releasing on master and would prefer to tag v2.0.0 on master, that is a viable option, but consider creating a v1 branch for any future v1 bug fixes.\r\n> - Alternatively, create a new v2 subdirectory (e.g., my/module/v2) and place a new go.mod file in that subdirectory. The module path must end with /v2. Copy or move the code into the v2 subdirectory. Tag the release with v2.0.0.\r\n>    - This provides greater backwards compatibility. In particular, Go versions older than 1.9.7 and 1.10.3 are also able to properly consume and build a v2 or higher module created using this approach.\r\n\r\nThis is yet to be solved in #496.\r\n\r\nAt the same time #532, so it is difficult to know when will other breaking changes be done.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we might cherry-pick some commits after `v1.10.0` (#508, #514, this and #531) and either:\r\n\r\n- Apply them on top of tag `v1.10.0` as hotfixes (`v1.10.1`).\r\n- Rebase/reorder master branch and tag/publish a new release (`v1.10.1`) just before the breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThe first option is not desirable, because we would have a bunch of duplicated commits, really close to each other. But, the second one requires to rebase the master branch.\r\n\r\n@hacdias , @Equim-chan , any ideas? > How would we do the first one?\r\n\r\nWe can either [cherry-pick](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) or:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit checkout -b tmp origin/master\r\ngit rebase -i v1.10.0\r\n# Remove the commits we don't want to keep in `v1.10.1`.\r\ngit tag v1.10.1\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit branch -D tmp\r\ngit push origin v.1.10.1\r\n```  Somewhat related to #502 - one more option to add: allowStyling. We should wait for #506 before doing this because of the commands compatibility.  What's the state of this PR? Ready for review?  @1138-4EB on travisstatus.com it says \u00abPartially Degraded Service\u00bb. It might be because of that.  Updated the README! Thanks @yaskor   Nope, it is supposed to work Could you try again? I will merge this in the meanwhile. If you still can't access Travis, please email me the data and I'll add the env vars and then we can check why you can't access it  Related to https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/485#discussion_r207921156, filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io#9 and filebrowser/caddy#4\r\n\r\nLicense: MIT\r\nSigned-off-by: Henrique Dias <hacdias@gmail.com> Wait for #492 Yes @1138-4EB, please do the honors \ud83d\ude04  @Equim-chan no, the DB wasn't changed at all \ud83d\ude04 just the CLI options and the config file @1138-4EB yes, it's ok for me to close this in favor of #506 \ud83d\ude04 and using BindPFlags as long as it works  Uh, this seems interesting.

We need that. @xor-gate, thanks for pointing it out. Would you like to propose a PR?\r\n\r\nI am concerned with passing arguments to gosec, because we do not run it directly, but through gomeralinter.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/.gometalinter.json\r\n- https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/build/run_gometalinter.sh  @vitaliy-kuzmich, filebrowser can be used in windows too, and docker images are based on scratch, so we cannot ensure that standard unix/linux users exists in the host.  Hi @maweck! Can you please:\r\n\r\n- Make a separate PR for the first commit (the one that modifies the Dockerfile).\r\n  - Reordering the `COPY`, `WORKDIR` and `RUN dep` lines is OK, but note that you removed the 'ca-certificates' in `RUN apk`. Your should keep that line untouched.\r\n- Run `gofmt -w ./` in the root of the repo, to have the style of all the go sources automatically fixed. Yes, I'll merge this and I can do that later. Thanks @maweck \ud83d\ude04   This seems to be due to a somehow buggy implementation of the case sensitiveness. While searching for `File3` produces the result you describe, if you write `File3 case:sensitive` in the search box it will provide a valid result.  @hugomassing, can you please let us know which version of filebrowser are you using (is it a release or you built your own), and provide the config file and the execution command. That will help us reproduce the issue.  It's ok. Let's try to find the breaking point. Can you try with the [latest release](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases/tag/v1.9.0) standalone? Just download the binary for your platform, execute it (use the default credentials admin/admin), set the 'After upload' command and try to upload a file. Let us know what output you get, both in the terminal and in the browser console. I just tried the following in a play-with-docker node:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser\r\ncd filebrowser\r\ncurl -L https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases/download/v1.9.0/linux-386-filebrowser.tar.gz | tar xvz\r\ndocker run --rm -itv $(pwd):/src -w /src -p 8000:8000 alpine sh -c \"apk add -U git && ./filebrowser -p 8000\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it works as expected. However, I had to ensure that:\r\n\r\n- `git` is installed in the box where filebrowser is being executed.\r\n- `git` is an allowed command in filebrowser.\r\n- `git status` is executed in a git repo, i.e. the file is uploaded to a git repo.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the test produces no output when the file is uploaded. I then executed `$git status` in the search box in order to check it.\r\n\r\n@hugomassing can you please check if your setup fulfills those requirements? Please, provide an example script where you try to setup the FILE environment. Also, let us know what command are you actually putting in the 'After upload' field. Last, please copy any output you get in the terminal. If it crashes, the backend will tell why it crashed. Then, try something like `bash -c \"echo $FILE\"`. It's the same. The point here is that commands are executed in filebrowser/golang by calling the system directly. If you need them to be executed in a shell environment/context (because you are using shell features such as envvars), you need to tell it explicitly.\r\n\r\nOne option is to use `bash -c \"your_commands\"` or `sh -c \"your_commands\"` as commented above. For the specific command you ask about, you will need to either escape the double quotes inside the command, or combine single and double quotes.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to write a script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nyour_commands\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, ensure that it is executable with `chmod +x script.sh`. Last, call it directly (`./script.sh`) or add it to the PATH. In order to add it the PATH, you can move the script to a folder that is already in the list (such as `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`) or you can edit the PATH to add the location of the script (`PATH=$PATH:<location>` or `PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)`).\r\n\r\nHINT: you can try `$bash -c \"your_commands\"` or `$script` in the search box of filebrowser, instead of editing the settings and uploading a file every time. It will make testing the script easier.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue because the original problem/question is solved. But feel free to continue the conversation.  Currently, the changelog for each release (created by [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser)) does not include the commits/PRs that belong to the frontend. Only those in this repo are included. It'd be desirable to have all of them included.\r\n\r\nSee goreleaser/goreleaser#915.  Just for completeness, this is related to #415.  We can install the ca-certificates from the latest alpine image by using [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/):\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM alpine:latest as certs\r\nRUN apk --no-cache --update upgrade && apk --no-cache add ca-certificates\r\n\r\nFROM scratch\r\nCOPY --from=certs /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\r\n```  @hugomassing, caddy includes all the plugins at build time (see https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/399#issuecomment-407251536). I.e. the codebase of the plugins is embedded in caddy, because all of them are built together. Therefore, AFAIK the is no way to update only filebrowser, you need to rebuilt caddy. However, I think that each release is pushed to GitHub releases and Caddy builder at the same time, so if you update Caddy regurlarly you should get the latest version. Might we know a little more about the context? \r\n\r\n@yurividal [mviereck/x11docker/blob/master/#L1018-L1147](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker/blob/master/x11docker#L1018-L1147) does this with a bash script. We can take it as a reference. Let's write a list of desired features:\r\n\r\n- [ ] In the frontend, check either GitHub releases or Docker Hub periodically and show a message if a new version is found. When automatic update is supported, add a button to the message.\r\n  - Make it optional and let the user configure the frequency.\r\n- [ ] Make filebrowser aware of the context: standalone, in a container or as a caddy plugin.\r\n- [ ] Function and handler (API) to:\r\n  - Retrieve a specific version or the latest from GitHub.\r\n  - Stop filebrowser, remove it and start the retrieved version with the same config file and options.\r\n  - If a docker image is being used, and if the requested version is available as a docker image, remove the container, retrieve the new one and start it with the same options.\r\n  - If filebrowser is being used as a caddy plugin, either:\r\n    - Disable this feature.\r\n    - Suggest updating caddy.\r\n- [ ] Add a button to the frontend (probably in the settings) to send a request. This should contain the desired target version.\r\n  - Currently, if `no-auth` is used, settings are not available. This should be changed, in order to support the automatic update.\r\n\r\nThe first task should be quite straightforward. Automatically updating filebrowser standalone might require a bit of work. The docker option seems tricky.  Right now there is no such `branch strategy`. Everything goes directly to `master`. Then, @hacdias decides when to build the frontend locally and bump the version.\r\n\r\nThere are some major changes being done in #399 and #450. Indeed, branch `develop` implements those issues. See corresponding documentation at https://github.com/filebrowser/community/pull/1/files.\r\n\r\nSorry about the misunderstanding. Hope it is easier to get it once we get those issues solved.  @hacdias would it be possible to bind some keyboard shortcut (which is unused in browsers) to this specific feature? E.g. `Ctrl+Alt+H` as in [winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_commander_key).\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, settings are not accessible when `notAuth` is set to `true`. On the other hand, I think that it is desirable to be able to change this fast. For example, when browsing a repo, it is handy to hide/show config files easily. On the whole, I think that hidding/showing dot files/folders should be a complement to (dis)allowing them. > [@yurividal]\r\n> Great idea. Ctrl Alt H or Ctrl shift H would really be awesome.\r\n\r\nIn Firefox `Ctrl+Shift+H` opens the History in a new window. Does `Ctrl+Alt+H` trigger anything in your browser?  If I don't get it wrong, what you are suggesting would be potentially dangerous as it should only be used through a properly configured proxy. If not, any user providing any `X-Forwarded-User` will have access. Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think that this is an interesting feature. Should you be willing to contribute a PR to implement this, I suggest to please:\r\n\r\n- Be explicit about the risk in the codebase.\r\n- Make it default to be disabled.\r\n- Add a message/log when filebrowser starts in this mode.\r\n- Consider adding an example configuration for a proxy such as NGINX or Traefik (or the one you are actually using).\r\n\r\nShould it be possible to use any mechanism that allows filebrowser to check whether it is being executed behind a (known) proxy, that'd be great. But I don't think this is compulsory. > That would be the plan :) My question here would be: How do you want the options to look like? Should I create a new option \"proxy-auth\" in parallel to \"no-auth\" or should there be something like \"auth...\r\n\r\nAre these options mutually exclusive? `no-auth` is exclusive for sure, so I think we should keep it as a separate flag. Then, `auth` (which enables multi-user support) should have two possible values: `default` (current implementation) or `proxy`.\r\n\r\nHowever, should `default` and `proxy` be compatible (i.e. requests coming from a known proxy are accepted but any other requires a password), then `auth` should not exists and `proxy` should be added only. In this case, if `no-auth` and `proxy` are enabled at the same time, `proxy` would act as frontend to provide access to a single common instance to multiple users.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let's hear what @hacdias and @Equim-chan think about this.\r\n\r\n> I would say that it is not the best idea to simply provide snippets that can be copy & pasted by people who do not know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nSure. I agree. I think that the best solution is to provide enough info so that a user that has already set up a proxy with access to a LDAP database (or any other source of credentials) finds just the additional references and snippets required to extend it to use filebrowser. This is why I mentioned a couple of common proxies. A new user with less experience will have to read the basic and intermediate references we would provide. I.e., it is perfectly ok to link to the NGINX manual and a few Stack Exchange Q&As.\r\n\r\n> Would it be fine for you to simply describe the idea/concept behind this feature and do a PR for: filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io after the feature is available ?\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly ok. Indeed, this issue and the comment in the PR are enough to explain the idea/concept. Then, adding a slightly longer and more specific explanation can be done either in [filebrowser.github.io](https://filebrowser.github.io) or in [filebrowser/community](https://github.com/filebrowser/community). I.e., the modifications in the options/flags should be changed in [filebrowser.github.io](https://filebrowser.github.io). But references and comments about the risks and suggestions for users implementing it can be provided in the community repo (see https://github.com/filebrowser/community/pull/1/files). In the end, the sources of both repos are markdown, so it is easy to reorganize the content once it is written.\r\n\r\n> Thanks and best regards\r\n\r\nThanks to you! Please, let us know if you need any further information about how to build/test the app.  Closing this because no info is provided. Please, reply to the questions in the template in order to let us know the context.  > So i have no idea how else to explain.\r\n\r\nCould you, please, provide the exact commands you are using to run both traefik and filebrowser. It'd be great if you could reproduce it in [play-with-docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).\r\n\r\n> Maybe it has something to do with the webserver from caddy itself and their setup?\r\n\r\nIt seems that you are not using filebrowser on its own, but rather using it with caddy, is it? Reopening this and assigning it to me, just to remember adding a note to let users know which docker image to use.  If I don't get it wrong, you are trying to:\r\n\r\n1. Execute filebrowser from a release binary.\r\n2. Access filebrowser frontend in a browser.\r\n3. Open a file in filebrowser.\r\n4. Edit the file and save it.\r\n5. Execute `gofmt -w *.go` in the 'Search box' of filebrowser, in order to have the edited file formatted.\r\n\r\nIf so, you should:\r\n\r\n- Enable command `gofmt` in the config, not `gofmt -w *.go`.\r\n- Then, write `$gofmt -w *.go` in the search box in order to execute it after you edited the file.\r\n\r\nPlease, let us know if this solves your issue. Should I misunderstood it, please reword the issue.\r\n\r\n@hacdias, I think that commands composed of multiple words are not supported, so this might be the underlying issue that produces the 'internal server error'. Can you confirm it? If so, do we want to add support for it? I.e., do we want to allow enabling the usage of a subset of the options available for a executable? I can reproduce it. `$gofmt -w *.go` in the search box fails because `*.go` is not handled properly. Indeed, the internal server error is related to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018/07/29 19:46:37 [INFO] Blocking Command:\"gofmt -w *.txt\"\r\nstat *.txt: no such file or directory\r\n2018/07/29 19:46:37 /main.txt: 500 Internal Server Error\r\n2018/07/29 19:46:37 exit status 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n@hacdias, should [`fielpath.Glob(pattern string)`](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Glob) be used?\r\n\r\nI can also reproduce the limitation to edit the content of a `.go` file. This is a know issue. See filebrowser/filebrowser#358. @1138-4EB instead of using filepath.Glob, we could do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexec.Command(\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"mv ./source_dir/* ./dest_dir\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way, we're invoking the shell and then it will take care of globs and everything else. Although, we need to know in which platform we are to do so. We can check if there is an `sh` path or `bash` and on Windows PowerShell or just keep it running directly.   @francislavoie, it seems that xfrr/goffmpeg is just a wrapper, so ffmpeg must be installed in the host. Since docker images are based on `scratch`, we would need either a statically compiled version of ffmpeg or change the base image. Zipping is a different issue, because it is done without any external dependency: https://github.com/mholt/archiver.\r\n\r\nI think that using a proper media player, such as VLC, is preferred to adding any heavy dependency (because of either the size or the workload). So, it'd be interesting to have that supported with authentication.  @VLEFF Can we close this issue now that filebrowser/filebrowser#468 and filebrowser/frontend#18 are merged?  @wistarine, please, provide some more information about your setup and the issue you are facing.  Try `$wget http://share.getpocket.in/25MB.test`. See filebrowser/frontend#7. It seems that the issue is solved, so I'm closing this. Feel free to open a new one to ask about how to configure nginx with filebrowser.  Hello @GRiverone! This seems to be a configuration problem with nginx, not directly related to File Browser. It might be related to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2056124/nginx-client-max-body-size-has-no-effect  Please, provide as much info as you can:\r\n\r\n- If yes, when have you done that?\r\n- What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)? Hint: either show the browser console or a screenshot.\r\n- How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible? @GRiverone can you reproduce this issue with the latest release?  Hi @karim2001! Please, have a look at #411 and #418.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you use the docker image and launch a container with `--restart always`, every time the docker daemon is started the container will be started too. To have the docker daemon started on startup, you can enable it with `sudo systemctl enable docker`. For further info: https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/ Closed in favour of filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io#5.  Not added by default. You need to add them to the frontend and build filebrowser yourself. See https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser-frontend/commit/52b25589b2299e337279641cb02029a6900996ed  A single master branch is used.\r\n\r\nWhen regular commits are pushed to GitHub:\r\n\r\n- CircleCI:\r\n  - The backend (filebrowser/filebrowser) is built for a single platform.\r\n  - A golang linter ([gometalinter](https://github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter)) is executed.\r\n- hub.docker.com:\r\n  - The built-in service is used to build a Docker image, tag it as `latest` and, if successful, publish it.\r\n\r\nWhen tagged commits are pushed to GitHub:\r\n\r\n- The three tasks above are executed, but the docker image is also tagged with the tag number.\r\n- CircleCI:\r\n  - The backend is built for multiple targets with [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) and a new release is pushed to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases).\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\n- https://circleci.com/gh/filebrowser/filebrowser\r\n  - https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml\r\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/hacdias/filebrowser/tags/\r\n  - https://hub.docker.com/r/hacdias/filebrowser/builds/\r\n- https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/.goreleaser.yml\r\n- https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/Dockerfile\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that travis-ci.org was used until five months ago: https://travis-ci.org/filebrowser/filebrowser/builds @hacdias, why did you stop using travis-ci as a CI service?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe current approach has the following (minor) caveats:\r\n\r\n- The backend is built multiple times: once in CircleCI for a single platform, several times in CircleCI if it is a release, and once in hub.docker.com if it is a release. Each of the procedures is completely decoupled from the others, so three build pipelines need to be separately maintained.\r\n- The latest image published in hub.docker.com is not ensured to be functionally correct.\r\n- The frontend must be built locally, in order to update `rice-box.go` with the artifacts.\r\n- Tags are only applied to this repo (filebrowser/filebrowser). Since the organization was created the frontend (filebrowser/frontend) is not tagged anymore: https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/releases\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMoreover, the current proposal in #399:\r\n\r\n- Builds the frontend, the backend and a docker image for each pushed commit in travis-ci.com. If successful, the image is pushed to hub.docker.com/filebrowser/filebrowser.\r\n- Currently releases/tags are not considered.\r\n\r\nSo, the build task in CircleCI and the build task in hub.docker.com will be duplicated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince all of the steps can be executed in travis-ci.com, I propose to add missing features to #399, and drop CircleCI and hub.docker.com as CI services. These missing features are:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add gometalinter to image `filebrowser/dev`.\r\n  - [ ] Enable `gosec` with excluded options (those related to using MD5). See https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/399#issuecomment-410459808.\r\n- [x] Add goreleaser to image `filebrowser/dev`.\r\n- [x] Add a test stage in travis to execute linting before any build.\r\n- [x] Add a deploy script to run goreleaser when tagged commits are pushed, and then upload the result to GitHub Releases.\r\n- Build docker images:\r\n  - [x] Tag images generated from regular commits as `filebrowser/filebrowser:develop`.\r\n  - [x] Use goreleaser to build and tag images generated from tagged commits as `filebrowser/filebrowser:<tag>` and `filebrowser/filebrowser:latest`.\r\n  - [ ] Extend goreleaser to build multiarch images. See goreleaser/goreleaser#707 and goreleaser/goreleaser#530. Close #440.\r\n- [x] Modify `publish.sh` to tag both the backend repo and the frontend repo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it seems that CircleCI allows to reproduce the builds locally (https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/). Therefore, if anyone has enough knowledge to implement an equivalent workflow in CircleCI only, that would be equally acceptable. > @1138-4EB I dropped Travis because it was a lot slower than Circle and in that time it was easier to get the different phases on Circle.\r\n\r\nI expected that. Indeed, CircleCI should still be much faster than Travis, because the latter needs to spin up a \"virtual machine\" for each stage and then run docker on top of it, while CircleCI is designed to run docker images directly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that Travis is offering a better solution from the integration point of view:\r\n\r\n- Stages provide a similar functionality to the phases in CircleCI.\r\n- Being able to cache results from one stage to the next allows to build the frontend (rice-box) just once and share it with all the artifacts.\r\n- Checks integration thanks to moving to GitHub Apps is a very interesting feature. See https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-07-announcing-support-for-github-checks-api-on-travis-ci-com and e.g. https://github.com/Paebbels/JSON-for-VHDL/pull/8/checks\r\n- I feel more comfortable with the Travis-GitHub Releases integration than having to create a GitHub API token for goreleaser to push artifacts.\r\n\r\nBTW, I am setting goreleaser to build docker images with it: https://goreleaser.com/customization/#Docker It seems that, in the very near future, we will be able to create multiarch images: goreleaser/goreleaser#530 So we might close #440 with #399.\r\n\r\nAnyway, should anyone know how to integrate everything in a CircleCI config which is equivalent to the `.travis.yml` I am writing in #399, please let me know. @hacdias just a quick update to let you know that this is almost ready. The only missing part is the Caddy [build server issue](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/399#issuecomment-401897721). I registered, but there is so little info about the build process. So merging #399 will have to wait until we can find a solution.  Also suggested in https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/314#issue-284780299. Closing in favour of #419.  Hi @gocpp , I'm glad to see that you reconsidered it and decided to reopen this issue. I'm replying to let you know that it is being read and that it is being taken as seriously as many other open issues in the project. However, as you may know, this project was started some years ago by a quite young student who started uni recently. No one is being paid to develop it and no one has enough free time to reply in three (weekend) days. Then, we need to be considerate with each other.\r\n\r\nOn my part, I'm trying my best to reorganize the content after the migration to a GitHub organization, in order to make it easier for new users to contribute (see filebrowser/community#1, #399 and #450). Hope it helps get some (wo)manpower involved in it!\r\n\r\nRegretfully, both my expertise and my main interest (#302) in this project are quite far from this specific issue. I use Hugo intensively for offline site generation, but not as a server itself; and I don't have a clear picture of how it should be handled in the context of File Browser (#310).\r\n\r\nSo, could please help me and any possible contributor to better understand your use case by providing reproducible steps to reach the limitations you found? E.g. by providing either the configuration files or the arguments you use to run filebrowser.\r\n\r\nAbout your second issue/bug, if I don't get it wrong you expect scopes to be recursive but they are not. Is it? If so, could you please open a new issue just asking that? I think that it might be easier to tackle it. > (until now I have done most of my developing in C and C++)\r\n\r\nThen, I'm sure you'll pick the syntax very easily. It is so close to C. Not so much to C++. You can have a look at this preliminary version of the docs I wrote this weekend to welcome new contributors: https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser-community/blob/patch-1/contributing.md If you want to go fast, just glance over https://tour.golang.org/ and then find your own way at https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn This might also be interesting to you: http://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/c2go/\r\n\r\nOf course, let us know about the issues you might find while getting contact with either golang or Vue.js, as that will help us improve the docs.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps I should indeed open a new issue for the second point.\r\n\r\nYes, please. Just cut it from here and paste it in a new thread. I always use filebrowser in `--no-auth` mode with a single user. But I'll definitely give it a try.  @ifengchao any feedback about this? Should we keep the issue open?  #436 and filebrowser/frontend#9 are merged already. Now, the screencast/screenshots in the README should be updated in order to show the new logo.  @DeAlexPesh , please have a look at #399 and feel free to join the discussion. We are duplicating work here.  @tokvv is changing from scratch to ubuntu compulsory? That seems to be a major change, not explicitly related to this issue. If so, we should probably discuss it in #300. @tokvv, yes, please. I agree that in some contexts it can be useful to have a shell available (e.g. 1138-4EB/hwd-ide). However, I think that choosing Ubuntu to be the only one is a strong decision.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, if a single one is offered I'd go with either Alpine or Deb\u00edan Buster Slim.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should we want to offer multiple ready-to-use images I'd extend #399 to provide five flavours: Scratch, Alpine, Deb\u00edan, Ubuntu and Fedora. See http://travis-ci.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think that the most sensible approach is to provide the scratch version only and add an explanation in the docs about how to add file browser itself to any image with `COPY --from=filebrowser/filebrowser`. Or see https://github.com/1138-4EB/hwd-ide/blob/develop/filebrowser/Dockerfile @tokvv, thanks. Unfortunately, I don't have write permissions. Let's ping @hacdias and @Equim-chan.  @airtonix, do you have any working example of building an ARM image in travis or any other ci platform? If so, I'd be glad to accept a PR on top of #399.\r\n\r\nhttps://goreleaser.com/customization/#Docker, goreleaser/goreleaser#707 and goreleaser/goreleaser#530.  There is an ongoing discussion about the build flow in #399.  Might this be closed in favour of #257? @juan11perez, I think that the main issue here is not to save the password raw. Although it is not relevant for \"home users\", it seems that some users are expecting to use filebrowser as part of a (probably paid) service for third parties. Therefore, we should be careful about how we implement it so that we don't introduce a false feeling of security. Alternatively, a naive implementation is possible, but we should clearly state that it is not save for production.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think that we should set `--no-auth` by default until we can ensure a save approach. Doing so would require a testsuite to evaluate it. @juan11perez, there is no need to apologise at all. Your proposal is reasonable. I just wanted to point out the difference between doing something \"less unsecure\" or doing it \"really secure\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, @hacdias must be busy with his uni exams. Let's wait until he can sit down and think about this.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it'd be useful if you could partially document your approach in the referred issue. I think that offloading credential management to an external layer (reverse proxy) is a valid workaround and it can help to keep filebrowser simple. But I am not sure about the implications that such a solution would have in granularity.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you want a solution, even though it might be not ideal, you can check https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/257#issuecomment-397765726 There is an existing proposal that uses environment variables.  Hello @FJHC, I need more details to know what might be wrong in order to solve this problem.  To use SSL with File Browser, it would be better to proxy to it via a web server like Caddy or Nginx. That way it is simpler.\r\n\r\nI would advise you to use Caddy since it gives you automatically generated and free SSL certificates (through Let's Encrypt) and has an [extension just for File Browser](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.filemanager).  What do you mean?  @hacdias, according to the README of go.rice, we can take advantage of the [order of precedence](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice#order-of-precedence) to implement this. The default build embeds the logo and favicons as go source (`rice-box.go`). However, should these be left out and should we distribute them either as an appended ZIP or as a sibling dir, it should find them as well.\r\n\r\nAs a first step, we can move the logo and favicons from filebrowser/frontend to filebrowser/logo, and have them copied before building the frontend. This would allow any user to clone filebrowser/logo and modify the images. Then, the build process in #399 should work.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we can split `rice-box.go` to `rice-box.go` and `rice-logo.box`, and provide two builds: one with `rice-box.go`only and a second one with both of them. The latter would be equal to the current release.\r\n\r\nHowever, we still need to come up with a scheme that lets us merge #399 without breaking the integration with the caddy build server.  @ikwyl6 I think that this is defined in the frontend only. See:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/blob/master/src/components/files/ListingItem.vue:\r\n  - [L9-L10](https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/blob/master/src/components/files/ListingItem.vue#L9-L10)\r\n  - [L114-L142](https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/blob/master/src/components/files/ListingItem.vue#L114-L142)\r\n  - [L153-L155](https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/blob/master/src/components/files/ListingItem.vue#L153-L155)  I'm closing this because multiple alternatives have already been given. Feel free to continue the discussion.  Thanks @timonss. I really like the one from the left, but I'm a bit unsure about the colors. What do you think @Equim-chan?  I really love this one! @timonss I'd like to suggest something though and I want your feedback of course: use the light blue on the circle for the diskette and change the inner circle color to white. Could you try that? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/40202596-5fa9baba-5a1a-11e8-9732-0f62bde99e5c.png)\r\n\r\nSorry:\r\n\r\n1. White\r\n2. The blue from 1 Yeah, what do you think? Yeah, sure @timonss! Thanks \ud83d\ude03  Is it possible to get it in SVG? @timonss the new logo is added to the master branch now. See https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser , https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/tree/master/logo and #444.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution! @DeAlexPesh since we are using git as a version control system, you can easily keep the old version. Just make a fork, and remove the commits you don't like. You can also add your own if you prefer (related to #420). @DeAlexPesh I both agree with you and prefer the new design at the same time. The previous one was too simple for me and I considered it to be more of a placeholder than an actual logo that identifies the project uniquely. I think that the one we have now is an attractive logo for pads, smartphones, etc. (see filebrowser/frontend#9), even though it can be tricky as a favicon/icon.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as I said, I believe that #420 is the way to go, so that the base app can be tailored to different contexts. Indeed, I just saw that @hacdias created [filebrowser/logo](https://github.com/filebrowser/logo), which I believe is meant to push in that direction.  From @Idesousa (on https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/521):\r\n\r\n> **Description**\r\n> Filebrowser shows symbolic links to folders as files.\r\n> \r\n> **Expected behaviour**\r\n> Symbolic links to folders showing as folders.\r\n> \r\n> **What is happening instead?**\r\n> Symbolic links shown as files\r\n> \r\n> **Additional context**\r\n> Is this a glitch?

Might have been a temporary error Glad it worked \ud83d\ude04   @andyhuai there aren't any templates. The custom CSS you write is added to the default CSS. That way you can override or just add some rules you want. @andyhuai [here](https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/tree/master/src/css). It's split into many files.  Closed in favour of filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io#5.  @wmjan I'll close this in favour of #244  @1kevin335200 did you try the armv5 version as suggested in golang/go#18483? Great! I'm closing this, as it seems to be an issue with that specific model.  Thanks! Updated.  Hello @changdapu,\r\n\r\nI used the translator so I can understand what you said. I hope I an give you the right answers:\r\n\r\n1. Didn't understand correctly. You can upload the files in one tab and work on another to avoid errors while uploading.\r\n2. Do you want to display the available space in disk?\r\n3. You can use rules to allow/disallow the access to certain directories. Or you can set a more restricted *scope*. I'd go for the last.\r\n4. How so? Like the right click on Windows?\r\n5. Could you try to explain it in another way?\r\n6. We can add some more documentation about how to customize the theme.  @1138-4EB did you keep the LF line endings? It seems to have changed the whole file. Thank you @1138-4EB! \ud83d\ude04   Thanks! \ud83d\ude04   I'm a little bit confused. File Browser **is not** a WebDAV server. @paul-hammant, yes, it is a server on localhost. You can choose in which port to listen to and which addresses ([check the config](https://filebrowser.github.io/configuration/)). You can, you then need to proxy Nginx or Apache to File Browser.  @1138-4EB how do you find this simpler/easier? `.sh` scripts don't run natively on Windows, for example. > How are you supposed to edit something in the frontend and have it rebuilt along with the backend?\r\n\r\nThere is `npm link`/`yarn link` for this kind of cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea, although I'd like to get some feedback from someone else. @Equim-chan what do you think about this? @hacdias, @Equim-chan, this is going to be long, but I think it is worth. Please, bear with me.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think that moving the project to its own organization was a good idea, and we should stick with it. It provides a generic name, not linked to any specific user, so it is easier to remember. It is also coherent with many other projects in GitHub, such as ghdl/ghdl, VUnit/vunit or portainer/portainer.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that the migration to a organization structure is not finished yet. #342 was just the first step. Now, we need to improve and polish it, in order to make development and collaboration easier.\r\n\r\nWe might merge filebrowser/filebrowser and filebrowser/frontend back. That would make local development 'easier' at first sight. Yet, it wouldn't be 'clean'. Those two repos are clearly decoupled, as one contains frontend dependencies (Vue, Js, CSS, HTML) and the other one is the backend (Go). By keeping them separated we are stating that alternative implementations can be made for any of them. For example, a different frontend can be written using Angular, but keeping the same backend. Equally, a different backend can be written using Python or Ruby, but keeping the same frontend. This is very valuable, because it lets collaborators focus on/reuse only the parts the need, instead of forcing them to analyze the whole project. However, for it to be a real possibility we should provide a good documentation of the API between them (see #224). I think we should use some service such as [Swagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swagger_(software)) ([explore](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search) existing projects). That's just one option. Docker's API docs ([docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/)) used to be built with a Hugo Theme ([moxiegirl/old-docs-base](https://github.com/moxiegirl/old-docs-base)). An interesting up-to-date theme for Hugo is [DocuAPI](https://themes.gohugo.io/docuapi/).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it'd be desirable to create a third repo named filebrowser/caddy, in order to make it clear that filebrowser is a standalone application. I believe that many users might find it useful without Caddy, even though it is most known for being a plugin of it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, related to you comment about the name, I think that filebrowser is better than filemanager, because the most notable feature as a standalone app is that this is a web-based solution. But, at the same time, it makes sense to use 'filemanager' in the context of Caddy. Anyone using Caddy already knows that everything is web-based, so 'browser' is redundant. As a result, I would stick with filebrowser for the project name, but use filemanager as the name of the Caddy plugin. Then, the filebrowser/caddy repo proposed above could be named filebrowser/filemanager.\r\n\r\nShould we push in that direction, we need to ensure that contributing to any of the three legs feels comfortable enough. At least as comfortable as it was when all of them where hosted in a single repo. This is not hard to achieve, because there was no documentation at all, so the first contact has always been raw. Therefore, this is a good point to elaborate helper scripts until we get a pleasant experience, before actually writting and updating the docs to provide the first version of contribution guidelines.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFollowing this motivation, and according to the conversation we had a couple of months ago (previous comments in this thread), I have further elaborated this PR:\r\n\r\n- I created an organization in [hub.docker.com/u/filebrowser](https://hub.docker.com/u/filebrowser/). I am the owner now. But, if you want to take control over it, just let me know and I will transfer it to you.\r\n- I set up [travis-ci.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser](https://travis-ci.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser/) for my fork. I cannot do it with this repo because I am neither a owner nor a collaborator.\r\n- I encrypted my docker credentials with travis, in order to support pushing docker images from travis-ci.com to hub.docker.com. See `./build/enc-dockerhub.sh`.\r\n- I added the frontend repo as a git submodule of the backend. See https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/#advice-on-using-submodules-or-not\r\n- I explicitly separated the following tasks:\r\n  - Getting dependencies and building the frontend (`build_assets.sh`).\r\n  - Building the backend (`build.sh`).\r\n  - Building the docker image (`build_img.sh`).\r\n- I created an image named [filebrowser/dev](travis-ci.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser), to support development/collaboration from hosts with a single dependency: docker. A script is provided to build it (`build_img_dev.sh`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is the proposed workflow:\r\n\r\n- A CRON job in travis-ci builds filebrowser/dev once a week. If successful, it is pushed to [hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/dev](https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/dev/). This is also executed when a new commit is pushed to branch `img-dev`.\r\n- A CRON job in travis-ci builds filebrowser/filebrowser every day. If successful, it is pushed to [hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser](https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/dev/). This is also executed when a new commit is pushed to branch `master`.\r\n\r\nSee https://travis-ci.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser/builds\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith the proposed scheme, all of the following development environments are supported:\r\n\r\n## No dependencies\r\n\r\nIf the developer does not want, or cannot, install any dependency at all, sources can be edited through GitHub.\r\n\r\n## All the dependencies\r\n\r\nIf the developer is willing to install `nodejs`, `yarn`, `go`, `git`, `docker` and `bash`:\r\n\r\n- `./build/build_assets.sh` gets frontend and backend dependencies, builds the frontend and updates `rice-box.go`.\r\n- `./build/build.sh` builds the backend.\r\n- `./build/build_img.sh` builds the `filebrowser/filebrowser` image.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a script named `build_all.sh` executes `build_assets.sh` and `build.sh`, one after the other.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the repo must be cloned in a path inside GOPATH.\r\n\r\n## Docker and bash\r\n\r\nIf the developer wants to install `docker` and `bash` only:\r\n\r\n- `USE_DOCKER=\"true\" ./build/build_all.sh` executes `build_assets.sh` and `build.sh` inside a `filebrowser/dev` container, instead of running them on the host.\r\n- `./build/build_img.sh` builds the `filebrowser/filebrowser` image.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the repo can be cloned anywhere.\r\n\r\n## Docker and bash, interactive\r\n\r\nIf the developer wants to install `docker` and `bash` only, but desires to execute `build_assets.sh` and `build.sh` separately, he/she can work inside a container:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  WORKDIR=\"/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser\"\r\n\r\n  $(command -v winpty) docker run -it \\\r\n    -v /$(pwd):${WORKDIR}:z \\\r\n    -w /${WORKDIR} \\\r\n    -p 8000:80 \\\r\n    sh -c \"\\\r\n      cd build && \\\r\n      dos2unix build_assets.sh && \\\r\n      dos2unix build.sh \\\r\n      sh\r\n    \"\r\n```\r\n\r\nExposing a port allows to execute filebrowser inside the container after the execution of `build.sh`, and browse it from the host.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n  - The repo can be cloned anywhere.\r\n  - Since the repo in the host is mounted inside the container, the developer can use any text editor/IDE in the host to edit the sources (say Atom, notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime...)\r\n\r\n## play-with-docker\r\n\r\nAny of the three options above can be used in a [play-with-docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) playground.\r\n\r\n## No connection\r\n\r\nAfter a first execution of `build_assets.sh`, dependencies (`vendor` and `frontend/node_modules`) are saved in the host. Therefore, as long as `filebrowser/dev` is already pulled, no internet connection is required for development. This applies to any of the options above.\r\n\r\n## PowerShell\r\n\r\nIf the developer is using a Windows box without any bash shell, the interactive option above can be used by slightly modifying the syntax. Then, there is a single dependency: docker.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdditional issues:\r\n\r\n- Is `goreleaser` affected by any of these changes?\r\n- How is `publish.sh` affected by these changes?\r\n- Should we modify `build_img.sh` in order to programmatically produce two copies of `dockerfiles/filebrowser`? One based on `scratch` and another one based on `alpine`. Only the first line (`FROM`) needs to be changed with sed.\r\n- Should we provide ARM variants of the images? This can be applied to `filebrowser/filebrowser` and/or to `filebrowser/dev`.\r\n- Right now, the latest versions of `node_modules`, `vendor` and `dep` are got. I don't know if this is desirable, or if it'd be better to use fixed/tagged versions and manually decide when to update dependencies.\r\n\r\nLast, I think that this message can be a valid starting point as a `Contributing` section, either in [filebrowser/community](https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser-community/blob/patch-1/contributing.md) or in filebrowser.github.io.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am working abroad for some months, so I won't have much time to actively develop the other pending issues I have (see [filebrowser/issues/created_by/1138-4EB](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/created_by/1138-4EB) and [1138-4EB/hwd-ide](https://github.com/1138-4EB/hwd-ide)). However, I am open to discussing this PR and providing support to the issues that might arise as a result of merging it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, because this PR is already functional in my fork ([1138-4EB/filebrowser](https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser) and travis-ci.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser) you/we can start using it there to see how it works, before actually merging the PR here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n\r\n- `dockerfiles/dev` relies on the GitHub API to retrieve the latest version of `dep`. If it is triggered frequently, it might hit the rate limit: https://developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit/ This is not critical, because it is set to run once a week. But I think it is good to point it out, just in case. A possible workaround is to fall back to a hardcoded version when it happens. However, I have not implemented this yet. > Sorry for this delay. Now I finally have some time to dedicate to this project!\r\n\r\nI hope you had a good year!\r\n\r\n> Yes, you could add me permission for that Docker Hub thing, but you can stay there too, of course. :smile:\r\n\r\nYou should be in the 'owners' group/team now. Please, let me know if you can edit anything, e.g. https://hub.docker.com/u/filebrowser/dashboard/settings/\r\n\r\nAbout `publish.sh`, I think that a single line needs to be changed, because `build.sh` will not exists anymore when this PR is merged: https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/publish.sh#L5 It is a somehow minor issue, but let's not oversee it.\r\n\r\n> Hmm, why would we?\r\n\r\nThere are some use cases where having a shell in the container is desirable. See https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/441#issuecomment-400317290 and https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/441#issuecomment-400473947. I would go with the last option: provide a single scratch image and document how to create others. But I am open to any discussion about it.\r\n\r\n> Yes, but sometimes there are some problems compiling for some combinations of PLATFORM+ARM.\r\n\r\nThen, let's keep it apart for now. We can follow the discussion about building ARM variants in #440. Should you have any specific information about those conflicts/problems, please add references there.\r\n\r\n> The node_modules are set on the package.json so they are fixed. For Go, we have Gopkg.\r\n\r\nFor node_modules, I was considering to add `yarn.lock` to the frontend repo. Just as we do with `Gopkg.lock` for the backend.\r\n\r\nAlso, see the previous comment about getting the `go dep` binary:\r\n\r\n> dockerfiles/dev relies on the GitHub API to retrieve the latest version of dep. If it is triggered frequently, it might hit the rate limit: developer.github.com/v3/rate_limit... > @1138-4EB just noticed you ignored rice-box. That is something I really wanted to do. Although, what is holding me back is Caddy: it can't build the dependencies on the fly on the build server.\r\n\r\nYes, I did it because in the current proposed scheme the frontend is built in a travis stage (test) and, on releases, it is cached to be used in a different stage (release). As a result, goreleaser produced an error because it considered the repo to be in a dirty state.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to automatically push that rice-box to the new caddy repo, by using a deployment key. This would be desirable as it would allow to automatically trigger a build in caddy each time we push tag a to filebrowser. However, I need some more info about the caddy build server. Could you, please, point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\n> Before merging this PR, we should create a repository which holds the content of caddy folder and on each release, it must contain the most update rice-box possible.\r\n\r\nI already moved the content to the new caddy repo (locally). But I'll wait until I have a clear understanding of the big picture before pushing it. I am thinking that a workaround for the caddy/rice-box thing can be to activate travis for the frontend too, and have the artifacts (a tarball of the 'static' folder and the rice-box file) deployed to GitHub Releases. But I don't know if caddy supports fetching files that are not in the git repo. Indeed, this problem affects not only rice-box, but filebrowser as a whole. If we can't add filebrowser as a submodule of caddy, it might be hard to update the plugin with each release. Any thoughts? @benitogf, mostly because of npm/npm#18434 and npm/npm#17621. But I am not a js developer so I might be outdated. Any strong feeling to prefer npm? @hacdias the last test I did was putting `rice-box.go`in filebrowser/caddy, instead of saving it in filebrowser/filebrowser. In the last proposed change for `publish.sh` (which is renamed (to `build/release.sh`](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/develop/build/release.sh) in branch [`develop`](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/tree/develop)), the release procedure is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Manually tag the commit that is to be used in filebrowser/frontend.\r\n- Execute `release.sh`, which will:\r\n  - Check if the tag exists in filebrowser/frontend.\r\n  - Update the submodule to the tag.\r\n  - Replace `untracked` with the semver/tag in `filebrowser.go` (through `sed`).\r\n  - Tag filebrowser/filebrowser.\r\n  - Revert the semver/tag in change in `filebrowser.go` and commit again.\r\n- When the tag in filebrowser/filebrowser is pushed, travis-ci detects it and:\r\n  - The frontend is built, thus `rice-box.go` is created.\r\n  - All the releases are built and published with goreleaser.\r\n  - A single image is created, tagged/named twice and published with goreleaser.\r\n  - [HERE]\r\n\r\nTherefore we could add a last step in [HERE], that automatically adds a commit on top of filebrowser/caddy in order to add `rice-box.go` and do any other compatibility task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have not been able to build filebrowser/caddy, being filebrowser/filebrowser a dependency of it (even without removing `rice-box.go`). Should you help me achieve this, I think that the next steps are quite straightforward.\r\n\r\nNote: once we get filebrowser/caddy and filebrowser/filebrowser decoupled, the semver/tag replacements with `sed` could be removed from `release.sh` and executed in travis. @benitogf, as long as NPM 6 works as expected, I don't mind. Are the populated `node_modules` folders compatible? Is it possible to use both of them interchangeably?\r\n\r\nEdit: the proposed development image is based on `golang:alpine`, which is itself based on `alpine`. The latest `nodejs` version available now is [8.11.3](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86/nodejs), and `npm 5.6.0`. Moreover, in the official docker image for nodejs 10.6.0 based on alpine, yarn is still being installed:\r\n\r\n- https://hub.docker.com/_/node/\r\n- https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/master/10/alpine\r\n\r\nTherefore, should both tools not be compatible, as long as this PR is concerned, I think that we should wait until npm 6.x is introduced in alpine, before going back to npm.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the relevant content/layers from image `node:alpine` could be added to image `golang:alpine`, we would probably have npm 6.x available now. @hacdias, the problem I had was due to conflicting `vendor` folders. If `filebrowser/caddy` is just a subdir of `filebrowser/filebrowser`, there is a single vendoring space. However, if it is split and dependencies are fetched for both of them, when you try to build/run `filebrowser/caddy` it complains.\r\n\r\nThis is my scheme:\r\n\r\n- filebrowser-hub/\r\n  - caddy/\r\n    - .git/\r\n    - ...\r\n  - community/\r\n    - .git/\r\n    - ...\r\n  - filebrowser/\r\n    - .git/\r\n    - frontend/\r\n      - .git/\r\n      - ...\r\n    - ...\r\n  - logo/\r\n    - .git/\r\n    - ...\r\n\r\nI start a `golang:alpine` container from `filebrowser-hub`:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ndocker run --rm -it \\\r\n  -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/filebrowser \\\r\n  -w /go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager \\\r\n  golang:alpine sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust `apk add git` and run `go get ./...`:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # apk add git\r\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.7/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\r\nfetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.7/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz\r\n(1/5) Installing libssh2 (1.8.0-r2)\r\n(2/5) Installing libcurl (7.60.0-r1)\r\n(3/5) Installing expat (2.2.5-r0)\r\n(4/5) Installing pcre2 (10.30-r0)\r\n(5/5) Installing git (2.15.2-r0)\r\nExecuting busybox-1.27.2-r11.trigger\r\nOK: 19 MiB in 19 packages\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # go get ./...\r\n# github.com/filebrowser/caddy/parser\r\n../parser/parser.go:251:32: cannot use db (type *\"github.com/asdine/storm\".DB) as type *\"github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/vendor/github.com/asdine/storm\".DB in field value\r\n../parser/parser.go:252:31: cannot use db (type *\"github.com/asdine/storm\".DB) as type *\"github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/vendor/github.com/asdine/storm\".DB in field value\r\n../parser/parser.go:253:31: cannot use db (type *\"github.com/asdine/storm\".DB) as type *\"github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/vendor/github.com/asdine/storm\".DB in field value\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can remove the vendor folder from `filebrowser/filebrowser/vendor` and it will then get dependencies successfully and also build:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # rm -rf ../../filebrowser/vendor/\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # go get ./...\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # go build filemanager.go\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # ls /go/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/\r\nfilemanager.a\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don't know how to test that. Note that the library was built without building filebrowser itself. Indeed, rice-box does not exist, because the checked out version is `master` in my fork.\r\n\r\nI pushed the modified sources I am using to the develop branch in `filebrowser/caddy`, so that you can reproduce the setup I explained. @hacdias, @mholt, my main doubt is not about vendor folders. Although not ideal, we can work around it by removing all of them and using \"absolute\" dependencies only. What I need to understand is how much of filemanager/filebrowser is required in order to build the plugin for Caddy. It seems that the plugin can be built even with an incomplete filebrowser codebase:\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/399#issuecomment-403868140\r\n> Note that the library was built without building filebrowser itself. Indeed, rice-box does not exist, because the checked out version is [master in my fork](https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser).\r\n\r\n```\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # go build filemanager.go\r\n/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager # ls /go/pkg/linux_amd64/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/\r\nfilemanager.a\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that Caddy builds the plugin and filebrowser separately? Or should we expect filebrowser to be completely embedded into Caddy?\r\n\r\nThe former would be ideal for us, since we would only need to instruct the Caddy builder to build `filebrowser/caddy/filemanager` and get the latest released binary from `filebrowser/filebrowser`.  @1138-4EB Awesome!\r\n\r\nI think the first solution is the best: a commit to a branch and create a Pull Request automatically. We'd just need to approve it. We just need to make sure that key *isn't able* to commit to master to prevent someone to change Travis.yml and make a change on a pull request. That for Filemanager plugin. WHat about Hugo and Jekyll? Would we need to replicate the file on three directories? What if we create a user, like, FilebrowserBot, which has read and write access except to master? The other plugins are basically the same as filemanager's but with other functionalities enabled so they also need the assets to run. > However, we need an e-mail account in order to register the bot both in GitHub and in Docker. @hacdias can you please handle it?\r\n\r\nWill do.\r\n\r\n> Note that, even though it might work, it is not a desirable solution, because we cannot push to mholt/caddy. It is just a test to verify that it doesn't really matter in which package we add the rice-box. It is only required for it to be compiled once into the binary.\r\n\r\nWe can do a \"dot\" import or \"_\" import (not sure which one it is) of the package containing the assets so it isn't repeated twice. @1138-4EB created the user. Created two teams on the repo (maintainers and ci) and maintainers have write access everywhere and ci only to caddy repo and conditionally:\r\n\r\n![github com_filebrowser_caddy_settings_branches_master](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/43683846-9a757ae8-988c-11e8-8a3c-9f263b676b90.png)\r\n\r\nThere must be a way to create a pull request from the CI. Many bots do that. [Take a look at this](https://hub.github.com/hub.1.html). @1138-4EB I'm merging this on [chore/build](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/tree/chore/build) and then I'll open a new PR with this as a reference. That way we an work directly on this repo with Travis and everything else correct, okay?  Try putting it in your PATH instead of using the full path.  Thank you @1138-4EB \ud83d\ude04   @hustarbor I can't reproduce this bug in any way. It's downloading fine here. Probably you have got some issues with your file permissions.\r\n  You can learn how to use File Browser [here](https://filebrowser.github.io/quick-start/).  Or your operating system MIME Types don't set 'avi' to be a video file.  Take a look at the page @Equim-chan mentioned above. \ud83d\ude04 I'll close this  @hacdias, unfortunately I am also unsure about what the default should be. Nonetheless, this issue seems to be outdated. The `0776` in `resource.go` that @march1993 mentioned are now set to `0775` (see #441).\r\n\r\nWe might want to close this issue and continue the discussion in #300, as both seem to be tightly related.  Could you just fill the form above, please?  Hello @maran and @Equim-chan,\r\n\r\nHere are my two cents: I think we have too much command line flags. When I say this, I mean: we don't have all of the possible features withing command line flags and we don't have all the possible configuration in a configuration file.\r\n\r\nI think we should invest on creating a better configuration file. See #371.  Closes #357.\r\n\r\nI'm always skeptical when adding more architectures. Yesterday, to release 1.7.0, I had to remove the MIPS arch because it was failing for some weird reason.\r\n\r\nAnyway, @Equim-chan, review and merge \ud83d\ude04   Thanks! Fixed  Duplicate of #244. Could you up vote it there please @wenerme? \ud83d\ude04   > @razaborg\r\n> Currently, filebrowser is run as root (at least for the docker version) and every file created through filebrowser is hence created as root too.\r\n\r\nFilebrowser is run as the user executing it. Therefore, if you execute it locally, permissions are those of your user. However, as you said, running containers as root (`UID=0`) is the default behaviour of docker. Filebrowser images are based on scratch so there is no configuration related to usernames inside them.\r\n\r\nThere are some mechanisms to run docker containers as a user available on the host (which is not root):\r\n\r\n- https://medium.com/@mccode/understanding-how-uid-and-gid-work-in-docker-containers-c37a01d01cf\r\n- https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/\r\n- https://success.docker.com/article/introduction-to-user-namespaces-in-docker-engine\r\n\r\n@ppnchb, @alex-phillips, if you are ok with using a single non-root user, running the container with the [USER](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#user) flag can be enough for your use cases.\r\n\r\n> @razaborg\r\n> Anyway I think that would be more secure to use Unix permissions under the hood rather than the \"everything belongs to the same user\" model...\r\n\r\nAs you see, Unix permissions are always used under the hood. I think that the difficulty to implement your proposal resides in mapping multiple users automagically. The first of the references above can be a good starting point to wrap your head around it.\r\n\r\n> @razaborg\r\n> Would that be possible? Would that need a lot of modifications in the code?\r\n> And if you don't have time for that, maybe you could tell me where I should start to look in your code to do that?\r\n\r\n- Directories and/or files are created in https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/http/resource.go#L184-L196\r\n- The struct that defines a user is https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/filebrowser.go#L363-L407\r\n- Users are stored in a database:\r\n  - https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/filebrowser.go#L56-L58\r\n  - https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/filebrowser.go#L183-L187\r\n  - https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/filebrowser.go#L189-L212\r\n- How to change the user from golang: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21705950/running-external-commands-through-os-exec-under-another-user\r\n\r\nHowever, due to #257 and #439, should you want to start tinkering with the code, I think that it'd be sensible to explore a mechanism to programmatically add several users to filebrowser's database. Then, it would make sense to read these from the host system. And, last, make filebrowser create/read resources as different system users. AFAIK, users right now are only used to limit the scope.  Could you share your config @UnAfraid ? Does it work for you now @razaborg?  Yeah, I really want to do this. Thanks for opening the issue.\r\n\r\nRight now, the database contains:\r\n- The users\r\n- The configuration\r\n- Share links\r\n\r\nThe good thing about having a database with BoltDB is that everything is really flawless and really easy to use. We could move users and configuration to the config file, but despite that being a good idea, it could also bring some problems:\r\n\r\n- Multiple processes trying to edit the file\r\n- If the user wanted to set the password via the config file they would need to encrypt it with the right algorithm (we won't store them in plain text!)\r\n- Were would we put the share links?\r\n\r\nSo, my **tl;dr** is: I agree we have to change the mechanics of the configuration+database, but we need to define really well how are we going to do this \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n/cc @Equim-chan? ### About the Users & Passwords\r\n\r\nWhat if we store the user information in the config file and the password in the database? Then, if a user was in the database and it didn't have a password, it would ask to set one on the first time. This way, there wouldn't be default passwords at all and it would be set at login time \ud83d\ude04 What do you think?\r\n\r\nExample config file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nport: 80\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\nbaseURL: /admin\r\nprefixURL: ''\r\nnoAuth: false\r\ndatabase: /path/to/database.db\r\nlog: stdout\r\nplugin: ''\r\nalternativeReCaptcha: false\r\nreCaptchaKey: ''\r\nreCaptchaSecret: ''\r\n\r\nusers:\r\n  default:\r\n    scope: /path/to/my/files\r\n    allowCommands: true\r\n    allowEdit: true\r\n    allowNew: true\r\n    commands:\r\n      - git\r\n      - svn\r\n  admin:\r\n    scope: /path/to/my/files\r\n    allowCommands: true\r\n    allowEdit: true\r\n    allowNew: true\r\n    commands:\r\n      - git\r\n      - svn\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could also add sort mode to the options (see #326).\r\n\r\nThe only problem I can find here is: what to do with the custom CSS?\r\n\r\n### Add Event Handlers to Config file\r\n\r\nSee #246.  Let's discuss it in https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/365.  Well, seems easier than expected.\r\n\r\nNew share link's hash is 6 bytes long, with a capacity of 256 ** 6 == 281,474,976,710,656. Fair enough imo.  See #366.\r\n\r\nSub-PRs:\r\n* https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/pull/3\r\n* https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io/pull/2 Done, and proven to be working.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17795845/36684492-77d7c058-1b5b-11e8-806c-562adac575ed.png)\r\n Just a bit off-topic though, I don't know whether I should feel happy or sad that we, and many other fellows, have to make so many extra efforts for those who are not yet able to embrace the freedom that they deserve. I don't really agree. `--recaptcha_host recaptcha.net` is longer than `--alternative-captcha`, and requires more parsing that is likely to fail if the user passes an invalid recaptcha host. The possible valid values are only `www.google.com` and `recaptcha.net`, so we can just use a boolean. recaptcha.net is also not very known.  In addition, if progress visualization is implemented, I think pause-able upload can also be implemented passingly.\r\n\r\n/cc @hacdias   Do you have proper permission on /var? I guess it's because of some special files in `/var`. The simplest way is `go get github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/cmd/filebrowser` (it may take a long time), and then you will have the binary under `$GOPATH/bin`.   Hold on, there are some extra works to be done (build, docker, CI). Done, ready for review.  filebrowser is using jwt instead of basicauth by default. If you intend to download and authorize with basicauth, try to set `noauth` in filebrowser and set corresponding basicauth middleware on the downstream.\r\n\r\nAccepting jwt and basicauth at the same time may be tricky on the current implementation.  This should have been fixed in 1.5.4, duplicate with https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/359. Please check out the latest version. /cc @hacdias   Confirmed, and requests to changing password also trigger the same bug.  Sorry, but you might have to build it on your own. `linux-arm-filebrowser.tar.gz` is targeted to armv6. Golang supports cross compile, so you don't have to compile it on the target machine.\r\n\r\n1. Download and install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/).\r\n1. `$ go get -d github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/cmd/filebrowser`\r\n1. `$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/cmd/filebrowser`\r\n1. `$ env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 go build`  Open devtools, switch to network and find any failed ones?  Are you using the latest Go version?  So, let's vote for a new name for File Manager, which must be also available as a GitHub organisation (ref.: #342). In the end of the month, the name with more thumbs up will be chosen.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add more options. The template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Name:** [Insert Name]\r\n**Slug:** [Insert Slug]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon't forget the plugins for Caddy will keep their names: filemanager, hugo and jekyll. **Name:** File Browser\r\n**Slug:** filebrowser @hacdias Let's move on? I see the changes are on going right now. Just a suggestion that can we change the title of https://github.com/filebrowser/vue? Maybe filebrowser/frontend or something.  Let's consider moving this repository to its own organisation, where we can separate better the front-end from the back-end and, eventually, add more contributors \ud83d\ude04  Hello @Equim-chan, so: you can keep doing your changes and this will be moved later. There are still things to settle such as CI flow and such because I'm thinking about splitting this main package into some smaller ones \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nAlso, we'd have to choose a name for the organisation since `filemanager` is not available. Any suggestion for the name? I vote on `file-manager` or `filebrowser`. Don't vote for `gophiles` because the front-end could be easily (I think) reused to other back-ends (like IPFS, which is one of my goals). Vote here, please #343 Ping @Equim-chan @arteta22000  May I ask for access permissions on the repos? I should be able to assign some issues.  Yeah, for me, go for it \ud83d\ude04 Thanks for all the PRs you've been making!!  Thanks!  Thanks! I'm going to merge this and release a new version. \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\n> Render with ReCaptchaSecret!? Are you serious? Isn't it \"secret\"? \ud83d\ude04\r\n\r\nOh, well... Never noticed that. No one would see it unless they changed the templates too so...  Does coinhive captcha mines crypto?? I personally don't think it is a good idea. Perhaps you can find another alternative to reCaptcha which does not eat the CPU/GPU of your users.  Thanks!  That's weird and it doesn't happen here. Is there a way you can debug the page to get more info? It seems your icons are not showing.  Thank you @Equim-chan!  Hello @Equim-chan! Would you like to implement that? \ud83d\ude04 Just don't forget that there are some pages that really use the Cookie instead of the `Authorization` header such as download. Nice! Good luck for them \ud83d\ude04  The problem is: the front-end uses the user from the token to get all of the information about the user such as their permissions, name, commands and such. Hmm... that's not what I read:\r\n\r\n> Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed\u2014for example, using public/private key pairs\u2014you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.\r\n\r\n[Source](https://jwt.io/introduction/)  I'm trying to adopt 6 bytes (8 in base64) version of share link, while keeping forward compatibility.\r\n\r\nCurrent version of 64 bytes hex string is indeed too long (even YouTube only uses 11 bytes base64-like string).  Thank you @Equim-chan. I run this with `top` and downloaded a 2GB files and it didn't seem to use more than 1MB RAM so I think it's good!!  Thank you @Equim-chan! \ud83d\ude04  Sure! Thank you @Equim-chan! \ud83d\ude04 It just must not put everything on RAM as I did before \ud83d\ude05   Did you check your server settings? I'm not aware of any problems of this kind. Did you check if your nginx server doesn't have a maximum upload size? I never return 413 in File Manager, so it probably is something else returning that.  Hey @joshk132 can you show me your configuration? Did you set the 'baseurl'?  Thanks for noticing that!  Hey @arteta22000!\r\n\r\nYup, that's a good point. There is already an issue opened for that (#155) but since no one mentioned it in a while, it didn't go forward.\r\n\r\nWe should keep the conversation on that issue.  @ryubaisan on user settings, you can find a section called 'Rules' where you can allow/disallow the access to files and folders. \ud83d\ude04  Oops, sorry. Try: ```disallow regex [\\\\\\/]\\..+``` to hide dotfiles.  I'm just trying to update some build stuff with Travis. Then I'll update Caddy \ud83d\ude04  Updated.  When you run `go get github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager` it will automatically download all of the dependencies.  Hello @mrunc. I use a 15\" laptop and I don't experience any issues with the interface. Could you send me a screenshot? You can set, for example, `body { zoom: 0.9 }`. Try it out! \ud83d\ude04   The `-s` flag is for the default scope for **new** users. So, if you had already run that command without the `-s` flag, the user was already created.\r\n\r\nPlease try doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Settings\r\n2. User Managements/Users\r\n3. Edit your user\r\n4. Change the Scope\r\n5. Save  Is it any of this versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmips, mipsle (32-bit MIPS big- and little-endian)\r\n\tSupports Linux binaries. New in 1.8 and not as well exercised as other ports.\r\nmips64, mips64le (64-bit MIPS big- and little-endian)\r\n\tSupports Linux binaries. New in 1.6 and not as well exercised as other ports.\r\n```\r\n\r\n? @ryubaisan here you've got the binaries for mips and mipsle of version 1.3.12\r\n\r\nhttps://we.tl/lc4coMfzmZ From now on it will be available: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/releases/tag/v1.4.0  I'm not able to reproduce this.\r\n\r\nAre you sure you put the right scope? Try using an absolute path. @Adagior @Alsan I can't reproduce this as I've said before. But I'll leave some question that might help me:\r\n\r\n1. Are you running this directly in your machine? If not, are you running this inside some kind of container?\r\n2. What's your configuration/the command you used to run?\r\n3. Did you check opening Settings -> Users and check the Scope?\r\n\r\n\r\n@Alsan: what is the `.virtualenvs`?\r\n   @Alsan did you check if the process that runs `filemanager` has write/read permissions over the scope? \r\n\r\n@Adagior  Does the user has really that *scope* defined on its settings? When you set `scope` in the configuration, you are only setting the default scope for **new** users. After a user is created, you'll need to log in and change it on settings.\r\n \r\nThe links [were changed](https://hacdias.github.io/filemanager/installation/#one-step-script). @Adagior could you check if you have any errors on the Developers Console (F12 -> Console)? When the error occurs, could you take a screenshot of Settings -> User Management -> Click edit on your user.? Do the user running `filemanager` has access to `/root`? THe strange thing about this is the error being Gone. Can you navigate to \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/34721818-3323d6a8-f53c-11e7-9e62-bb877f815902.png)\r\n\r\nAnd see what it says?\r\n Not that, open the URL directly please It says it is from 'Disk cache'. Could you try to clean the cache? Probably some error while saving to the database but I can't reproduce this error. Since I can't reproduce it, I won't be able to fix it \ud83d\ude1e  Have you tried on another machine/OS? Is it happening with the standalone or with Caddy? So, not working on Vultr. On your local machine the same happens? The error seems to be triggered [here](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/http/resource.go#L113), which then directs me to [this functions](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/file.go#L103). The error 410 is, in really, a Not Found error but for a file we knew that existed but doesn't exist anymore. I have never had that error.  I'll close this then. But that's **really** weird cause version 1.4.4 only has a typo fixed. Maybe some build bug?  @maryjeck unfortunately I'm aware of this and I couldn't yet figure out why is this happening. \r\n\r\nI'll close this since it's a duplicated of #269  Probably the problem is exactly what you're saying (the RAM). I'll try to find a way to download it in chunks. THanks for reporting \ud83d\ude04  Hopefully this was fixed in #303. We're now streaming the file using `io.Copy` instead of using `http.ServeFile` which was, I think, putting it all in memory and then serving it to the user. I'm publishing the new version (1.3.12) and I ask you to test it and reopen this issue if the error persists (I hope it doesn't \ud83d\ude2e) I'm being able to deploy the new version to Caddyserver. You can always download it through [releases](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/releases) and proxy it through Caddy. As soon as it is deployed into `caddyserver.com` I'll ping you. /cc @mholt Deployed! You can now download it with the fix \ud83d\ude04  I just downloaded a 2GB file from a VM with 1GB RAM without any issue. Are you using any other plugin (like Minify) *with* File Manager?\r\n\r\nIf you're using Minify on the same URL as File Manager, try disabling it. I'll open an issue on caddy-minify (which was also created by me. That's why I knew it may be causing this problem...). Sorry!  Hello @1138-4EB!\r\n\r\n> A single command line argument overrides all the defaults\r\n\r\nI have to check this to see what's going on. Not sure if it's caused by Viper or something I've done wrong but I don't remember having any issues with that.\r\n\r\n> Commands: requirements\r\n\r\nYes, Hugo (or any other static website generator) **must** be installed separately. This way we reduce the File Manager binary size and give the users more flexibility about the version they want to use.\r\n\r\nI'll add it to the docs.\r\n\r\n> Commands: response for non-existing commands\r\n\r\nIt's strange that you receive an empty object. I'll check that and show a better message.\r\n\r\n> Commands: parser\r\n\r\nA prefix sounds good and makes sense.\r\n\r\n> Commands: quick access list\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting. Wouldn't you like to develop it?\r\n\r\n> Edit files without extension\r\n\r\nWhat if we try to open a binary file without extension?\r\n\r\n> Tabs\r\n\r\nThis would be interesting indeed.\r\n\r\n> xterm.js\r\n\r\nPersonally, I really like this idea. Although, I think it is outside of the scope of File Manager. I only let some commands to be executed to give the user some flexibility.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to have full access to a server, they can use SSH.\r\n\r\n> Tiling\r\n\r\nHmm... Interesting idea, but maybe trying to develop File Manager too much.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: I like your ideas, but I find that some are a bit outside of the scope of this project. I'll check the errors and the problems you had and try to figure out the solutions.  Sorry, I didn't quite understand. Do you want to create directories, but the user which is running filemanager isn't allowed to? That's strange. I have set it to create directories with 776 ([source](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/http/resource.go#L185)). Are you sure the user that runs filemanager has the correct permissions? @hacdias I've done some investigation and realized that it is exactly how mkdir expects to work under *nix systems. A bare mkdir call is limited by umask. With a umask value of 0022, new directories will be created with permissions 0755 at most. New files will have permissions 0644 at most. \r\n\r\nThere are several ways to fix it\r\n* Call `syscall.Umask` on init, and change all mkdir's permission into 0777. The downside is that if filebrowser is running as a plugin then it may cause something bad to the host.\r\n* Call `os.Chmod` immediately after calling `os.Mkdir`.\r\n\r\nPlus, I think it should be an option for users to choose desired fmask and dmask value.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15210 I think the option should leave to the users, while 0755 can be a default value (for dmask). \r\n\r\nI myself have met a scene to customize the permission. Since the user/group running filebrowser is different from my own user/group, I add my personal user to the group, expecting files/directories created by filebrowser to be writable from the group.\r\n\r\nAlso it's better to separate fmask and dmask. The default fmask value can be 0644.\r\n\r\nPlus, `os.Chmod` is better than `syscall.Umask` since the latter one is platform specific and is likely to cause more problems. If I am able to touch a new file, I must at least have -wx permission on the current dir, then I can of course chmod the file. Am I wrong? Hmm, I think the change should be made in github.com/hacdias/fileutils instead.\r\n\r\nAlso should we really prefer umask over chmod or? Okay I'll try, but just a bit busy at the moment.  File Manager doesn't set up HTTPS by itself. You can use a web server and proxy File Manager through it. You could check [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), which has automatic HTTPS \ud83d\ude04   Hey @llovvoll!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it works. But try to set the scope to the path as you'd normally do in File Explorer. Sorry, I can't understand you said \ud83d\ude1e   Hello @hdstar2009 \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nThe flag `-s` only tells File Manager which will be the default scope for *new* users. If your user was created in a previous run when you didn't use that flag, it will have the old scope.\r\n\r\nYou can update it on **Settings** -> **User Management**. \r\n\r\nhope it helps!  Could you check #294 to see if there is anything related, please? Could you show me if there is any error on the Developer Tools' Console? That's strange. Are you using File Manager behind a proxy or something? So:\r\n\r\n1. The proxy is somehow blocking the websocket connections.\r\n2. I don't think the problem with the wildcard is related to File Manager, but I admit it is strange. Can you run it successfully on the directory via terminal? I'll try to discover what the problem is. But I can't guarantee it to be this week \ud83d\ude1e   Please check the user settings to see if the commands are enabled and if you have 'ls' there. I can't reproduce that behaviour :( Probably. File Manager doesn't even return 400 (Bad Request) in the commands handler. Does AWS Load Balancer and HA Proxy let you use web sockets?  You used docker so I think the problem might be the same as this one:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/277#issuecomment-346124183 Try changing\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilemanager:\r\n    image: hacdias/filemanager:latest\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./data:/srv\r\n      - ./filemanager/config.json:/config.json\r\n      - ./filemanager/database.db:/database.db\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilemanager:\r\n    image: hacdias/filemanager:latest\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./data:/srv\r\n      - ./filemanager/config.json:/config.json\r\n      - ./filemanager/database.db:/etc/database.db\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo set the database.db path to the specified on config.json. You still get redirected? The thing is: I'm not being able to reproduce this error. That's why I'm not being able to help. I'll try again as soon as I can and leave an update here. @MarvBob can you check if you have any errors on the developer console?  No, the browser's developer console. :) Check if you have any errors beyond\nFordbidden on /auth/renew.\nOn Thu, 4 Jan 2018 at 08:57, Marc <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I don't know how to access the dev console within the docker container ?\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/293#issuecomment-355230091>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFMdsDYFgKSKpTsx-0dDuGyFg_TzAyImks5tHJJ8gaJpZM4Q5WrW>\n> .\n>\n Did you check Console tab?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/34558968-fa5d4e92-f137-11e7-99e1-759d6a691872.png)\r\n Oh... that error is interesting (the `TypeError`).

Try this command: `GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle go build`.  I think this would be a very nice feature to have! Thanks for suggesting. I'll probably only be able to start this in three or four weeks when I start to have more time to give to this project. In the meanwhile, if you have time and are interested in this, you could fork the project and start implementing this \ud83d\ude04 I'd give my help if you needed.  Some people have been asking me to write the documentation for the API of File Manager. Please vote here instead of creating a new issue \ud83d\ude04 I'd really like to do this, but first it is more important to improve File Manager (and fix bugs!!) and document its features. OMG. Didn't see. Thanks @francislavoie   Duplicate of #128. Please vote there with a reaction or a comment, please \ud83d\ude04  Sorry, deploying \ud83d\ude04   Hello @oopsmonk! Thanks for this \ud83d\ude03   Duplicated of #275  Hey @xizirumeng! Do you want to have multiple URLs pointing to the same File Manager instance? I haven't used nginx, but something like this could work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocation /file1/ {\r\n    proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlocation /file2/ {\r\n    proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:5001;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `:5000` and `:5001` are the different ports for each File Manager instance. If there are two different File Manager instances. One for `/file1/` and another for `/file2/`.\r\n\r\n### For `/file1/` you could have:\r\n\r\nconfig.yaml\r\n\r\n```\r\nport: 5000\r\nbaseURL: /file1\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\ndatabase: \"/path/to/database1.db\"\r\nscope: \"/path/to/your/files\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For `/file2/` you could have:\r\n\r\nconfig.yaml\r\n\r\n```\r\nport: 5000\r\nbaseURL: /file2\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\ndatabase: \"/path/to/database1.db\"\r\nscope: \"/path/to/your/files\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### On nginx\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocation /file1/ {\r\n    proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlocation /file2/ {\r\n    proxy_pass 127.0.0.1:5001;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Sorry, please try the following config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nport: 5000\r\nprefixURL: /file1\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\ndatabase: \"/path/to/database1.db\"\r\nscope: \"/path/to/your/files\"\r\n``` This configuration is working with me:\r\n\r\n```nginx.conf```\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp {\r\n    server {\r\n        location /file1/ {\r\n            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        location /file2/ {\r\n            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5001;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nevents {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFile Manager 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\nport: 5000\r\nbaseURL: /file1\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\ndatabase: \"/database2.db\"\r\nscope: \".\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFile Manager 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nport: 5001\r\nbaseURL: /file2\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\ndatabase: \"/database1.db\"\r\nscope: \".\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou just need to update the ports and the addresses accordingly. Sorry for not being helpful as needed but I'm glad you found out how to make it work \ud83d\ude04   Hello @spawnia! You **must** set the path to the site root and to the database in your file system (outside of Docker)! Like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run \\\r\n    -v /path/to/sites/root:/srv \\\r\n    -v /path/to/database.db:/database.db \\\r\n    -p 80:80 \\\r\n    hacdias/filemanager\r\n    --port 80\r\n    --database /database.db\r\n    --scope /srv\r\n    --other-flag other-value\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find more [info here](https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/installation/#docker).  Thanks! \ud83d\ude04   It will be fixed in the next release \ud83d\ude04   Just pushed a fix. Could you please try again?  Duplicate of #257  Thank you!  Please vote on #285, please. I hope I can do this until the end of the year.  Duplicate of #128. Please vote there with a reaction or a comment, please \ud83d\ude04   Hey! That doesn't seem a scope path issue. It seems like you're just inserting the wrong credentials. I'll try creating a directory with Chinese characters to check the behavior. ~I tried with those characters and it is working here. Are you 100% sure the password is correct?~ Actually I just found the bug.  Hello! This plugin doesn't provide WebDAV anymore. You might be referring to [caddy-webdav](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-webdav) plugin. That plugin is designed to give Caddy WebDav features so there is no reason why it should be used without Caddy.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use WebDAV without Caddy, you might try to search for webdav servers. There are quite a few! \r\n\r\nHope it helps!  Duplicate of #265: same cause.  When you don't select a folder, you are telling FIle Manager to copy it to the \"Currently navigating on\" path. In that case, you're trying to move it to where it is right now, so it will generate an error. Copy/Move greyed out!  Done!  Hey! Could you please check if the developer console shows any error, please?  File Manager is aimed to be used with the latest browsers. It works well on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (both on Mac and Mobile) and Chrome mobile. @magikstm, I don't think I should support IE on File Manager. It would increase the final binary since I would have to inject many features. It doesn't even support 'startsWith' for strings.  Hello!\r\n\r\nThat way, you're configuring Hugo's/Filemanager's own auth system as well as basicauth and they're colliding which will make neither of them work!\r\n\r\nYou could try the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnelson.pavlosky.net {\r\n  root /srv/pavlosky.net/nelson/public  # the folder where Hugo generates the website\r\n  hugo /srv/pavlosky.net/nelson /admin {\r\n     no_auth\r\n  }\r\n  basicauth /admin username password\r\n  expires {\r\n    match .png$ 1y # expires png files after one year\r\n    match .jpg$ 1y # expires jpg files after one year\r\n    match .html$ 5i30s # expires html files after 5 minutes 30 seconds\r\n    match .css  1y # expires css files\r\n  }\r\n  gzip\r\n  errors {\r\n    404 404.html # Not Found\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope it works! \ud83d\ude04 \r\n Hey @skyfaller! By default the credentials are admin/admin. If you want to create a new user, or change your current password/username, just to go the Settings. I know you'll find how to do the rest there \ud83d\ude04  I will just close this issue since it's main subject is solved. I need a bit of time to clean every issue up and solve every problem \ud83d\ude1e   You just need to double click on it like any other file \ud83d\ude04   Hey @jzaefferer!\r\n\r\nYes, I like the idea and would like to implement it. Unfortunately, I haven't had much time for this. If you'd like to give a hand, you could check this files:\r\n\r\n- [Flags](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/cmd/filemanager/main.go)\r\n- [Where the default pass is set](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/filemanager.go#L192)\r\n\r\nIf you need anything, just ping me and I'll try to answer ASAP. portainer/portainer is a partially open source web app where the backend is written in golang (although the frontend is based on Angular, instead of Vue.js). Having a look at their codebase might be interesting for anyone trying to implement this. See http://portainer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html#admin-password @ncresswell, indeed, I got to know this project when you mentioned it in portainer/portainer#1380 in november. Do you think if the know-how you have in portainer about this issue can be somehow ported here? @ncresswell it is saved in the database, but the default values are hardcoded. See comments https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/257#issuecomment-353321710 and https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/257#issuecomment-396936650 above.\r\n\r\nSource at https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/filebrowser.go#L193-L196\r\n\r\nIn order to add a flag: https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/cmd/filebrowser/main.go#L27-L117\r\n\r\nThis implementation, referred by @jzaefferer, uses environment variables: https://github.com/var2dan/filemanager/commit/351dd8ee1244e231eb77b6efec57cb95dc2ab07b  Sorry \ud83d\ude1e what is a \"2.x angled application\"? @GlauberF what is your use case? I'm not seeing any reason to use this with Angular.\r\n\r\n@rigon I just wanted to try something new and I thought Vue would fit this project too. Sorry, but this File Manager is using Vue.js and it's all packed together. What you are trying to do is to use the same back-end as this one with a Angular.js front-end? Can't you use File Manager's own front end? \ud83d\ude1e I can't help you much with this since I haven't written docs for the API (see #285 and put a thumbs up there :smile:). I would recommend you to read the code and try to do the same but with Angular. Closing due to inactivity.  Thank you \ud83d\ude03   Good idea! Thanks for this \ud83d\ude04   Isn't that going to replace the user's settings? This is a good idea if the user doesn't set its own language. Thank you \ud83d\ude04   Thanks!\r\n  There is any error on the Developer Tools' Console? This is a weird uri for the websocket: ```ws://()/app/command```. What is the configuration you're using with `filemanger`? Could you please try changing `baseURL: ''` to `baseURL: '/'`? Try adding this option to your config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprefixUrl: 'FQDN/'\r\n``` This is really weird. I'll try to reproduce this on my computer. @manyang901, could you please check my last reply with code on #278? I hope it helps. Sorry for being so late \ud83d\ude1e  The 403 Forbidden errors can be safely ignored (at least if they only appear before logging in *or* if you try to make some action to some directory/file you don't have access to).\r\n\r\nI'll close this since https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/278#issuecomment-344525960 seems to be working.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other problems, just reopen this issue.  Thanks for reporting. We'll take care ASAP. Started uni some weeks ago and I'm still getting used to everything. Sorry \ud83d\ude1e   SSL is not on the plan because File Manager itself is meant to be used behind a proxy or something that acts like a server and not to be a server itself.  Thanks for reporting. We'll take care ASAP. Started uni some weeks ago and I'm still getting used to everything. Sorry \ud83d\ude1e  I'm not sure whether or not this is a good idea. Currently, File Manager saves it's configuration to a .db file. If we were going to do put the event commands on the config file, the configuration would be too much split around many files. What do you think? What is your use case?  Replace `_ \"github.com/hacdias/filemanager\"` by `_ \"github.com/hacdias/filemanager/caddy/filemanager\"` please \ud83d\ude04 It should work I will! Thanks  Thanks for reporting. We'll take care ASAP. Started uni some weeks ago and I'm still getting used to everything. Sorry \ud83d\ude1e   Hello @sisqi! Probably no. Most of the shared hosting hosts don't allow the user to run binaries but you can contact your host and ask them if they do.\r\n\r\nHope it was helpful!  Hello @v-garcia! No, there is no way to serve File Manager through SSL connection without a web server. File Manager wasn't made to be a server itself. You should use another web server and proxy it to file manager **or** use Caddy.  Thanks for reporting this \ud83d\ude04   Hey @jivank! Thanks for the suggestion. I think that the command's feature should be redesigned in a more deep manner. Any suggestions? Do you think it should be separated from the Search?  Hey @rigon! That's quite an interesting story. Gladly you managed to make it work! Hope you have been enjoying it! I'll mark this as `help` since it might be useful for more people in the future \ud83d\ude04  Cool! Might be useful for some people \ud83d\ude04   Hey @maxux! I really like what you did here! I'm just asking myself: what if you added `before_` handlers for those actions? Do you think they would be useful? Thanks! \ud83d\ude04  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/30173054-67a75ae4-93ee-11e7-9c39-93d98c1b9837.png)\r\n  Thanks!  Hello @kairen! Thanks for the updates \ud83d\ude04   Hey! Currently I'm using [this](https://godoc.org/github.com/mholt/archiver) library and I can't do that now with it so I'll close this for now. If more people ask for this, I'll consider it. \r\n\r\nAlthough, if you really want this, you could try to do it and make a PR \ud83d\ude03  Lol \ud83d\ude02   Thanks \ud83d\ude04  @rigon I'm not being able to reproduce this. The files are downloading with the full name here.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/30155186-0b157408-93b4-11e7-8caa-be658cfe99f7.png)\r\n I'll try with the FF version I've installed.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: found an answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21442903/firefox-has-problems-when-downloading-with-a-space-in-filename  Hey @rigon! I edited your post so it is easier to keep track of the Features you requested. I just committed the autoplay thing since I agree.\r\n\r\nAbout the jump to the next file: I think an option on the user profile would be the best. What do you think?  Thanks for the suggestion and you're absolutely right.\r\n  Oh! I presume you downloaded via Caddy. I forgot to release the newest release there. It will probably be fixed in ~20 mins.  No, it is not possible to configure File Manager to use Nginx nor Apache to serve static files. The static files are served by Go standard library with [ServeFile](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeFile) function.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by `video preload=medata`?  Hello @Sharkkkk! Thanks for the feedback and the suggestions.\r\n\r\n1. RAR is a proprietary archive format and thus it can only be created using WinRAR or other tools from their company. That way, I can't add a RAR compression.\r\n2. What is Axel?\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude04   There is no Go library to compress or decompress 7zip files either. Sorry for that. But we have a lot of formats available!\r\n\r\nAxel is [this](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/axel.1.html), right? If so, it's a command line utility. I can't really use Axel on the browser. I could create custom button such as it was suggested in #127 but the interface would get a bit cluttered if you added too many custom buttons.\r\n\r\nYou can also create an alias on Linux for that command and you'd only need to run one command. Did you try it? \ud83d\ude04  You could create a script such as `mycommand`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nunar -p xxx 123.rar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run `chmod +x mycommand` and add the file to the `$PATH`. Then, you could run the command `mycommand` from anywhere you wanted.\r\n\r\n`mycommand` would be a shortcut to `unar -p xxx 123.rar`. Tell me if it worked so I can close the issue, please. File Manager wasn't made to be a terminal on web. It's just a file manager. The addition of some commands is just a way to let users run some tools such as unrar.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the suggestion of using sshWebConsole but I will not implement it. If you need ssh, you can use ssh with your terminal. A Web Console could be a security hole and once again, File Manager wasn't made for it.\r\n\r\nSorry for this, but the best is to run the command for every different file.\r\n\r\n  Hmm... The custom style is **user scoped**, I mean, it's a setting for each user. Technically, the login page is not supposed to get customized since the user hasn't logged in yet.\r\n\r\n> If you log out after having logged in, because of the SPA architecture, the login page is then styled afterwards \ud83d\ude06\r\n\r\nI can fix this though.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat would you suggest since the custom CSS is per-user? That's probably a good idea. I'll think of it \ud83d\ude04  I'll will be available with 1.3.2!  Thanks for reporting \ud83d\ude09   ~Running using Caddy or command line?~\r\n\r\nI've to create a new flag for this. I'll add it ASAP. Yes, I'll do something like that. Although I'm not going to be home for the\nnext 3 days so I don't know if I can publish that change until Monday.\n\nOn Fri, Sep 1, 2017, 3:01 AM dstreet26 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Just to be clear and helpful, I would want to enter something like this:\n>\n> filemanager -p 8080 --staticgen hugo --baseurl \"/admin\"\n>\n> Or something like that.\n>\n> Alternatively, in the config file:\n>\n> {\n>   \"port\": 8080,\n>   \"noAuth\": false,\n>   \"address\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n>   \"baseurl\": \"/admin\"\n> }\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/226#issuecomment-326467490>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFMdsHFqUwYZ8tOZggIuwpTp8vVcC23Wks5sd2VZgaJpZM4PJG-_>\n> .\n>\n Available on 1.2.7. The flag's `--baseurl`. I know what the problem is. I have a BaseURL and a PrefixURL, which are different things. PrefixURL is the part of the URL which is stripped from the request **before** it comes to File Manager and this is what you want because the program is running behind a proxy. I'll add the new flag now \ud83d\ude04 And then you don't need to use caddy if you don't want to. Just pushed v1.2.8. It will build and the binaries will be available soon.

I'll probably do them \ud83d\ude04   Thanks @rigon! I'll think about it and it is, indeed, easier to navigate that way \ud83d\ude04   Thanks for the updated :smiley:  I'll investigate this! Thanks \ud83d\ude04  Hello @arisxama! I'm not being able to reproduce this error. However, I'm on Windows so I'll probably install a Linux VM to try it out. Closed by #281.  Hello @elico!\r\n\r\nYes, I haven't documented that because I thought it wouldn't be needed. But File Manager supports those methods:\r\n\r\n**Authentication**:\r\n- **Path**: `/api/auth/get`\r\n- **Method**: `POST`\r\n- **Payload**: `{ \"username\": \"username\", \"password\": \"password\" }`\r\n- It answers with a JWT token.\r\n\r\n**REST**:\r\n- Required HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer {token}`\r\n- `GET/api/resource{path}` - Get file or path listing\r\n- `DELETE /api/resource{path}` - Delete file or directory\r\n- `POST /api/resource{path}` - Create file (content is the request body) or directory\r\n- `PUT /api/resource{path}` - Update file (content is the request body)\r\n- `PATCH /api/resource{path}` - Move/copy file. \r\n    - `Destination` header with the new path.\r\n    - `Action` header with either \"copy\" or \"move\".\r\n\r\nIf you need more info, tell me \ud83d\ude04 \r\nI may put a better version of this in the docs in the future! I'll close this then \ud83d\ude03 Anything else, just file another issue or reopen this one.  Thanks for noticing this \ud83d\ude04   Hello @amenolo!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for your feedback! \ud83d\ude04 I like your suggestions and I think that 1 and 4 can be easily implemented and they may be useful for many users. I'll think about the others and I'll keep this issue updated!\r\n\r\nYes, you can translate it to Italian and I'll surely include it in the next build! \ud83d\udcaf \r\n\r\nThanks! I'm not sure if I can use reCAPTCHA. It asks me the domains I'll use with it and that's something I can't really tell. I can ask for the API Key though. I'm thinking about using [Noty](https://ned.im/noty/#/) for success and error messages. What do you think?\r\n\r\n**p.s.:** I'll be stroking the items from your post as they are implemented. Hello @amenolo! Thanks! But it won't be gold for the next 4/5 days since I won't be home nor with a computer \ud83d\ude1e \r\n\r\nI'll see the recaptcha thing when I return. \ud83d\ude04   Hey @amenolo!\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Going to implement it now!\r\n3. Go doesn't provide a function to get the size of a directory so I would have to walk through every path inside a directory and sum the sizes of each file. That's not complicated, but it's not desirable - image that a user has thousand of sub folders: we would have to walk through all of them and see the size of each file. I'll leave this to do if someone else wants it too. ReCaptcha implemented! I'll add the docs soon.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Docs: https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/configuration/  Sorry, will investigate this tommorow.  Related to #204 Fixed with 1.2.6 \ud83d\ude04 You can download the new version from caddyserver.com!  Hey! Sorry for this. I'll fix it tomorrow hopefully.  It will be out with 1.2.5  Thanks a lot @coco-perso \ud83d\ude04  Hello @coco-perso! Just pinging you since I added a new line to the translations file: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/commit/889871ec0a1fac26dee1b3152d0f87e2a7af2c65#diff-fe6ccd8f0bf41f00b9ff5d61b8e0e3e9 \ud83d\ude03   I'll check this out. Thanks! I'll try to solve it ASAP. Right now I'm making an upgrade on this which will take one day or two but then I'll solve this. Sorry for the delay! This is my output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS D:\\site> caddy -validate\r\n[WARNING] A database is going to be created for your File Manager instace at C:\\Users\\henri\\.caddy\\filemanager\\186f83e3c4a947cde85e22d48d5e3cee.db. It is highly recommended that you set the 'database' option to '186f83e3c4a947cde85e22d48d5e3cee.db'\r\n\r\nCaddyfile is valid\r\n``` I just tested it now without changes (on master and didn't receive any error). I'll try the downloaded version. I don't receive any error on my computer using the latest version from caddyserver.com. I haven't made any changes there since this issue was opened.\r\n\r\nDo you have any instance of Caddy running with that database? If so, the file is locked and then it can't be validated. I'll try to change to readonly though when the validate flag is active. Hmm... I'll change it then when the flag validate is active. But when the validation logic is invoked, is the server still running? I mean, is the database connection still active?  Hey @maxux! Thanks for pointing this out. I'll check if I have the latest versions of everything (node, npm, webpack, ...) and see if I can reproduce this \ud83d\ude04 Today I wasn't home so I'll probably only solve this tomorrow. Hopefully it's fixed \ud83d\ude04  NP!  I don't know if someone had made a dark theme. However, if you're willing to, you can build your own theme and add the CSS on **Settings**.  You are not supposed to use two websites with only one database. The database doesn't allow multiple connections because it locks the file.\r\n\r\nI'll try to see if I can do something about this but I can't promise anything. It will be available on the next release \ud83d\ude04   Hello @berglh! Thanks for the feedback! The `shift` thing was something I though of implementing before but I didn't. It will be out in the next version.\r\n\r\nI will also add the Copy/Move buttons to the current files' view.\r\n\r\nI'm just quite reluctant relatively to the `space bar` thing. I would prefer to have thumbnails but that's something I have to think about yet. Do you have any idea of how to implement it?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Move/copy current file to a folder\r\n- [x] SHIFT to select a range of files  Yes, I can make it an interface instead \ud83d\ude04  Hey @olihey! There is a problem with this though: the User.FileSystem must be able to be Marshalled and Unmarshalled as a string to JSON and I'm not seeing a way of doing this using an interface. What do you think? Hey @olihey!\r\n\r\nYeah, making \"everything\" an interface would be an hassle right now but it could be done. It just depends on _how_ to make the changes. \r\n\r\nPlease take a look at this file I wrote before: https://github.com/bruhs/shopy/blob/master/user.go Take a look at the whole package if you want and tell me if that scheme would be of your interest!\r\n\r\nInitially I thought about doing like that. Although, in that time, I didn't really need to. It would help in the way that you could fetch the user from your own source. And with the right changes, you could also use your own File System. Pinging @olihey  Hmm... I don't have any docs for that but it is possible to use just the front-end. Did you see the link I sent you? I'm willing to make some changes for this to work if you think that that code design works \ud83d\ude04  I'll work on that then. Done! @olihey \r\nTake a look at the code \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/cmd/filemanager/main.go#L172  You can create the users after starting Caddy. The users will be saved to the database and persist across reboots and such. I recommend you to set the 'database' option to a specific path. > Is it possible to use Caddy's authentication middleware in conjunction with Filemanager?\r\n\r\nYes, it is.\r\n\r\n> In addition, if I click the Cancel button in the Cady login dialog (Basicauth) the Filemanager login screen appears.\r\n\r\nThis is strange since we're using `no_auth`. It shouldn't happen. I'll investigate. Fixed with 1.2.6 \ud83d\ude04 You can download the new version from caddyserver.com!  I'll add this soon. \ud83d\ude04  I'm deploying to the Caddy server right now. [Check the docs!](https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/caddy/). It already includes the update!  Hey, I'll fix this ASAP. It only happens when not using Hugo or Jekyll. This was a very stupid mistake I made. v1.2.3 on the way.  Thank you @Equim-chan \ud83d\ude04 You're awesome! Hello @Equim-chan! Just pinging you since I added a new line to the translations file: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/commit/889871ec0a1fac26dee1b3152d0f87e2a7af2c65#diff-fe6ccd8f0bf41f00b9ff5d61b8e0e3e9 \ud83d\ude03   Hello! Thanks a lot for this, I'll merge it and release it ASAP \ud83d\ude04  Hey @Equim-chan,\r\n\r\n`buttons.next` and `buttons.prev` refer to the files: next file and previous file. You can see them when you open a preview of a file (like an image) and there will be two buttons: on at the left side of the page, and another at the right end of the page.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/29239583-0274b742-7f4a-11e7-8173-5d56ab95a1ae.png)\r\n\r\nThe `files.body` and `files.metadata` is this text:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/29239587-1be6154a-7f4a-11e7-9da3-dba76bd60bb3.png)\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm thinking about removing those titles... what do you think?  This will be available on the next release \ud83d\ude04   Hello @aiastia! I really want to help you, but I didn't quite understand what you said. \ud83d\ude1e Could you try to be a bit more clear, please? This is weird... I don't have this problem here, but the value \"E:\\\\bt\" is only used for *new* users. The initial user was created with the initial value.\r\n\r\nOn http://localhost:8888 go to: **Settings** \u2192 **Global Settings** \u2192 **User Management** \u2192 Click the button to edit your user \u2192 Change the scope \u2192 **Save**.\r\n\r\nHope it helps! No problem! \ud83d\ude04   Thanks \ud83d\ude04   It's the correct behavior. File Manager isn't supposed to create a folder for you when you set the user's scope. The user's scope should be an already existent folder.\r\n\r\nI'll think about this. I don't whether or not implementing this is a great idea though. This will be out in the next release \ud83d\ude04   Thanks!  Which method are you using to upload? Using drag'n'drop or the upload button? Oh, thanks. Gonna fix it. The Docker image will build now and the fix will be available in some minutes.  Thanks for the idea \ud83d\ude04 It's a really good one. Added to the roadmap. This will be available as soon as 1.2.0 is released (which will be soon!) \ud83d\ude04  Hey @ToyoDAdoubi! Sorry for being always pinging you! I've got some new stuff: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/commit/868434360592aa0280e0d631840750d53a564cd3#diff-fe6ccd8f0bf41f00b9ff5d61b8e0e3e9 Thanks :smile:  Thanks \ud83d\ude04   Thanks!  Folders are created with 0666 permissions... you can see the [source here](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/resource.go#L167). I can't see where the problem is now... I'll try to reproduce this. I have 0666 for the default permissions now. What do you think I should change it for? 0766? I pushed a fix for this (changed to 0776) and it will be out when 1.2.0 is released (today or tomorrow).  Thanks!  Hey @ToyoDAdoubi,\r\n\r\nI'll implement this when I can. \r\n\r\nAbout the language files, I added this to the files section:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsortByName: Sort by name\r\nsortBySize: Sort by size\r\nsortByLastModified: Sort by last modified\r\n``` Just added some stuff to the translations file: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/commit/6ee846ef0eab0f3b91ff3557877cd2eb63acb505#diff-fe6ccd8f0bf41f00b9ff5d61b8e0e3e9\r\n\r\nI already fixed this issue and it will be available on the next release \ud83d\ude04   Thanks!  That ^ @ToyoDAdoubi, I've got some new stuff for you (https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/commit/da4fd84002f4cac1d4e04f65c96237a553203d83#diff-fe6ccd8f0bf41f00b9ff5d61b8e0e3e9) \ud83d\ude04 Thank you!\r\n\r\np.s.: the 'hugoNew' thing is related to this: http://gohugo.io/ Hello, Hugo New will only show up when the user activated the Hugo module (a static website generator). Hugo New is a command of Hugo CLI so I think that the best option is to leave it as it is. \r\n\r\nPost is not the verb, but the name (equivalent to article).  Thanks \ud83d\ude04   I'll merge this but I'd like to ask you not to do this kind of changes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/28813243-5c64ec80-7690-11e7-9a97-9cac30197606.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5447088/28813249-64856994-7690-11e7-9abb-54f42c7fffca.png)\r\n\r\nIt is removing the correct number of whitespaces for the indenting. I don't know whether or not this is a problem with or editor or if it's you changing it manually.\r\n\r\nI'll merge this. Thank you \ud83d\ude04    I'll think about creating an option for that. Right now it is not possible in any way.  Hello @martinbaillie! Now available on caddyserver.com. Just add the option _no_auth_ to the Caddyfile \ud83d\ude04  NP \ud83d\ude04 I'm the one who should thank you.  Hey @aaboyd, could you try downloading it again, please? I had that problem some days ago and I fixed it in the meanwhile. Yeah, I deployed a version with that bug for like 1 hour and then I changed it. Hopefully no more people downloaded it in that time! \ud83d\ude0c   Done! Sorry for that.  Sure! Sorry for that.  Hello @hsluoyz\r\n\r\nI thank for the suggestion, but how could it be useful in for File Manager's use case?  Thank you! \ud83d\ude04   Thank you! \ud83d\ude04   Hello @casio! Thanks \ud83d\ude04 The easiest way to fix this, for me, is adding the button in the other pages. Does it sound good to you? Only when we the server gets a change event. You can also run it by adding the 'hugo' command to your user. That way you can run any hugo command anytime, anywhere \ud83d\ude04  Hello! I know there are some users using Hugo with watch option in the background. Although, I don't think l it's a good idea because unless you want to update the site at every change, the site is already updated when you hit the publish button.  This update is already available on Caddyserver.com. I'll close this issue since its main topic is closed. We can finish the conversation about the os proccess here though.  I'll try to reproduce this. Which is the version of FF? I'm not getting that error here. I'm also using FF 54.0 but I don't receive any error at all. Could you try on another computer with FF, please? Or eventually try to clear the cache (although I don't think it would solve, but we never know). Yes, please.  Strange... I get the same error on FF here. But when I download from caddyserver.com I don't get it. Have you built it manually or downloaded it? Oh, wait. I think I know what the problem might be: the characters in the password! @AstonDavies, could you please try disabling the GZIP and see if it works? It seems FF isn't decompressing the server's response body... Don't worry. I just fixed it \ud83d\ude04 I'll ping you when this is deployed to the server. I don't think so. I forgot to add the Content-Type to the header of the response. Although, the other browsers decompress it anyway. I'll push the fix and ping you when deployed. Will try to let the new version out today. Deployed to the caddyserver. Please check if the issues is fixed, please.  Sorry \ud83d\ude1e  I just downloaded from caddyserver.com and didn't get any error :(\r\n\r\n**Edit**: I don't get this. On Windows no error, On Linux error. Deploying... when it finishes it should be fixed. I'll ping you then. Done! Not your fault. It was mine. Try again pls Awesome!  Thank you \ud83d\ude04 \r\nYou can download it [here](https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/get.sh). I'll ping you when the new website is ready. The instructions will be there! \ud83d\ude04   You mean the interface in other languages? I'll see what I can do, but then I will need people to do the translations. I'll work on this \ud83d\ude04  I'm implementing this on [i18n branch](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/tree/i18n). As soon as I have a translation file ready to be translated in other languages, I'll let you know. @ToyoDAdoubi see [this file for example](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/i18n/assets/src/i18n/en.yaml). You only will need to create another for your language with the translations.\r\n\r\nI'll also create a Portuguese translation since... hmm... I'm Portuguese \ud83d\ude06  Thank you \ud83d\ude04 I just merged it. Although, it will not be available for download right now. It will probably be out when 1.0.3 is released. There are still some corners to polish. The translation file is not complete yet. I'll add some more phrases and will tell you afterwards to  add the, okay? Just made some additions: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/commit/bb8f7d0958f3316226c08661ac987edc4fff33c3#diff-fe6ccd8f0bf41f00b9ff5d61b8e0e3e9 Hello @ToyoDAdoubi \ud83d\ude04 How's everything?\r\nI just made some changes to the [language file](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/assets/src/i18n/en.yaml). I removed and added some new things to translate. The removed ones were also removed from the Chinese file! I think those are the only ones, yes. :)\n\nOn Wed, Aug 2, 2017, 11:09 AM Toyo <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @hacdias <https://github.com/hacdias> After comparison found that only a\n> few of the new content, there is no missing what?\n>\n>  language: Language\n>  settingsUpdated: Settings updated!\n> languages:\n>   en: English\n>   pt: Portuguese\n>   zhCN: Chinese (Simplified)\n>\n> #185 <https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/pull/185>\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/168#issuecomment-319629579>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFMdsJytIyRE8gG1v7vkKj8NKY1MxPqdks5sUEragaJpZM4OmhAN>\n> .\n>\n So, you can already download the newest version (1.1.0) from Caddy or from the releases page and it will come with the language option \ud83d\ude04  I really thank all of your work translating this \ud83d\ude03   Why did you change archiver's user to your own fork?

Thank you.  Oh, I guess it would happen when building Hugo and FileManager together. I'll try to find out why.  I just downloaded from Caddyserver a file with both Hugo and File Manager and I haven't got any errors. Did you build it manually? I'm not being able to reproduce this \ud83d\ude1e  Can you show me your imports, please? Replace my section, from:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo\"\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/caddy-minify\"\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/caddy-webdav\"\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/filemanager\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/caddy-minify\"\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/caddy-webdav\"\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/filemanager/caddy/filemanager\"\r\n_ \"github.com/hacdias/filemanager/caddy/hugo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd try again. The repositories have changed. That's probably it. No problem \ud83d\ude04   I mentioned this: https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/161#issuecomment-318354035 \ud83d\ude04  NP!  That's a pretty nice script! I'll make you a challenge: if you make an installer script like [this](https://getcaddy.com/), I may get it published on `hacdias.github.io/filemanager/get.sh` or something. Accept the idea? \ud83d\ude04 (Don't depend on Python though) Awesome dude!\r\nI'm working on a simple, small, website and this will absolutely be there \ud83d\ude04  [Check This](https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/getting-started/#installation-script) \ud83d\ude04 \r\nThe website isn't finished yet, btw. If you have any suggestions, just ping me.  Hello! What's the problem? Blocking Command is meant to indicate that the command is running in a synced way. Or it doesn't work? Could you try setting the path of the files on the Hugo command and see if you still get the error? The commands from after_save, before_save and so on are executed with no specific working directory. That's why the command was failing and you needed to specify the directory.\r\n\r\nI don't know if I should set the working directory for the default scope or the user's scope. Why? Because each user can have its own different scope so the commands which depend on a working directory would fail.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I'll close this issue. I decided not to change the working directory of the command - so you will need to specify the source - because this would not be very correct from the File Manager's point. If someone wants to execute the command in a specific path, he just needs to do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash -c \"cd /path/to/files && mycommand\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope there's no problem with this.  Thanks for the report! I'll check this out Could you please check the value of `Root` on `/cms/settings/global`, please? Btw, I already fixed the bug that was preventing to execute other commands other than the first one in the list, if you noticed. I haven't deployed to the build server though. Oh! One question: the file you were editing when you clicked the publish button was content/_index.md? Thanks! I think I already know what the error might be.  I think that the push I made will fix this, but I haven't deployed it to the Caddy server yet. I'll ping you when I do. Deployed @AstonDavies! Please check if the error persists, please \ud83d\ude04   Thank you \ud83d\ude04  Hello @AstonDavies!\r\n\r\nSorry for this. This is the exactly same mistake I did with filemanager plugin, but I haven't updated the Hugo one to fix it \ud83d\ude1e I'll fix this now I'll deploy this fix to the build server and ping you when it finishes the build. If the other issues persist, you then tell me \ud83d\ude04  Deployed! @AstonDavies   Hello @bartlomieju \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n1. Start running `npm run dev`\r\n2. Then, `go build`/`go install` github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager\r\n\r\nI have to update the docs to make them more clear!\r\nTell me if that's what you're doing and if you're still receiving the old files. Strange... did you try cleaning the cache? No problem! I'll look forward for your PRs \ud83d\ude04  Hello @llitfkitfk! I really appreciate what you did here, and I thank you for that. The checks are failing but it is my fault, so don't worry about it. I've this things to ask/comment:\r\n\r\n1. I always assure that the files `rice-box.go` are always up to date so I don't think that the `npm run build` and the rice commands are needed. It would only be a problem if I forgot, but I have a `pre-push` git hook to build it for me so I don't forget, ever. What do you think?\r\n2. Is godep really needed? Couldn't we just `go get ./...`? What are the advantages? Disadvantages?\r\n\r\nI'll look forward for you answer. \ud83d\ude04 I'm really excited to merge this!! So, okay, I'll leave GoDep \ud83d\ude0b \r\nAbout rice, I think that if:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM node:alpine\r\nWORKDIR /src/app\r\nCOPY . /src/app\r\nRUN yarn install && rm -rf assets/dist && npm run build\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`rice embed-go && cd ./caddy/hugo && rice embed-go` \r\n\r\nWere removed, there won't be any problems, since it is on the repository already. I think those are extra unnecessary steps. Could you try it, please? Hey! Thanks.\n\nOne more thing: I'll ask you to remove the godep please. Right now, file\nmanager is also a Caddy plugin and its build server doesn't support godep\n(it go gets all dependencies). Since I'm using Travis I believe I can keep\nfilemanager keep up to date with the dependencies now. Do you mind?\n\nI appreciate your effort on this, though. But I don't feel it's needed now.\nAfter this change I'll merge the PR. :)\n\nOn Thu, 27 Jul 2017 at 09:57, \u7530\u6d69 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> done\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n>\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/pull/157#issuecomment-318302200>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFMdsPiKhl-fXXcRbJbwFomSTfigXrHoks5sSFEMgaJpZM4Okt1D>\n> .\n>\n Thanks. The dockerfile still calls some godep commands. \r\n\r\n Thank you :) when I arrive home I'll publish it to docker hub and ping you here.  @llitfkitfk,\r\n\r\n~So, I made some small updates (ef315082edf5fb7d28731f80d7e961468d69d6e7) in order to be supported on Docker Hub. And here it is: [hacdias/filemanager](https://hub.docker.com/r/hacdias/filemanager/).~\r\n\r\n~I was thinking about changing ENTRYPOINT to:~\r\n\r\n```\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/go/src/github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager/filemanager\", \"--port\", \"80\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~So the user only needed to add `-p somebeautifulport:80` when running since it was already attributed to 80. I don't think there's any problem since it is running inside a Docker image. What do you think?~\r\n\r\n~**Edit**: after all, I think that changing the default `CMD` to `[\"--port\", \"80\"]` would be better than having it to display the help but this should be done in a more automated way.~\r\n\r\n~The `scope` should be a VOLUME.~\r\n~The `database` should be an external file too, right?~\r\n~The `config` should also be an external file. How do we get it?~\r\n\r\nI'm a bit new to docker \ud83d\ude05 \r\n\r\n~I'm trying some stuff here, but I won't push it now because you were the one who had the idea and I'd like your opinion on this.~\r\n\r\n**Edit:** got a better idea.

Yes, you can delete a user even if it is the last one (you just need to reload Caddy to create the admin again).\r\n\r\nI just pushed a new version to the server. Could you check if the bug is solved, please? \ud83d\ude04  Which browser are you using? I don't have this bug Hello Po Chen! It does have the type='button' as you can see here:\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/assets/src/components/User.vue#L62\n\nI'd suggest you to try to clean the cache since it might be caching the old\nJavaScript file.\n\nWhen I get to the computer, I'll try on Firefox though.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 25, 2017, 1:08 AM Po Chen <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Firefox.

Gonna change that \ud83d\ude05  The best to do is to put the delete prompt outside of the form.  I'll release it on Caddyserver.com and I'll ping you then. Done @princemaple \ud83d\ude04   Thanks @princemaple! I have already found that bug but I didn't really know where the problem was \ud83d\ude05 Thanks!  If it is 403 (forbidden), the problem should be on the permissions side. Could you tell me if there is any error on the Developers Tools (F12)?\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce. You sure the file has the right permissions? Can you delete ir or rename it? Or you can't just preview? Could you try logging out and logging in again to see if it works again? I think there isn't any problem with the token since you can delete (which needs the token to be sent too, but sends it in the HEADER instead of sending it in the URL).\r\n\r\nThe back-end is only looking for the Auth in the URL or the Header, but I think I should remove the URL and make it check the Cookie instead. It's better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to make sure if the problem is the token in the URL: please try downloading a TEXT file that you *can* edit. When you click the download button, it will also generate a URL that has the token in it and ping me \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nSorry for all of this Hmm... Indeed it *must* be the token in the URL, but I don't have that problem here \ud83d\ude2d Which is the browser you're using? FF? I just tried on FF too and I don't have that problem \ud83d\ude2d I'll remove this URL thing anyway and make it check the cookie though. Let's see what happens. This is where the token is extracted from the request: [auth.go](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/auth.go#L93-L105). I'm going to deploy this to the server now and I'll ping you when it is done so you can try again \ud83d\ude04  @princemaple, the newest build is already available to be downloaded from caddyserver.com \ud83d\ude04 Please tell me if it works I really can't see any problem with your Caddyfile. The strangest thing is that it you receive a 403 error when previewing, but you can download, delete and rename the file, right?\r\n\r\nAnd can you search *and* execute any commands? The thing is that this only happens with requests that *don't* send the token via `Authorization` header. Since I'm not being able to replicate this, I presume this is some problem with the system you're using.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Docker, could you just try running Caddy with File Manager outside of Docker, pointing to the same files and check if it works? Or try another folder with image files to see if it works, please.\r\n\r\nThis is *so* strange. I have to leave home right now, but I'll try to help you later and keep this issue in mind. The most obvious problem would be permission issues, but since you can delete and rename, that must not be the problem. If the issue is really related to filemanager's source code, it must be related to the auth. > Actually, I think I know why. For the requests that do FAIL, they are sending a basic token instead of a bearer token. Ring a bell?\r\n\r\nThe token is the same. But for the requests that FAIL it is sent via Cookie. The others send it via a specific HTTP header. Although, you had the same problem before, when I was passing it through the URL. I haven't understood which basic token is that yet.\n\nI'm not storing the password in the JWT but I'm storing some user\ninformation on it so the front end knows what to show to the user.\nOn Wed, 19 Jul 2017 at 09:29, Po Chen <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Are you storing username and password in the jwt?

Finally I got a binary about caddy.\r\nBut when I execute it, I see the error: \"could not locate box \"./assets/dist\"\"\r\nIt seems that some assets are not properly compiled.\r\nAs I have little knowledge about js and babel, I can not continue to build it.\r\n\r\nCan you provide some detail about how to build this plugin when you are free?\r\nThank you~\r\n\r\n \n\n_Copied from original issue: hacdias/filemanager-old#101_ Hello @messyidea!\r\n\r\nI'm doing a complete rework on this plugin and the new version will be out soon and I'll leave the instructions afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut if this is a urgent thing, I can write them today. _From @messyidea on July 10, 2017 14:18_\n\nHi,\r\nIt's not very urgent to me now. \r\nJust finish your own work first :)\r\nThank you ~ I'll leave more information afterwards, but try building 465b10a the way you did before. It should work. @messyidea, I just wrote some [instructions](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/README.md#contributing) and I hope they can help you, but I'll try to improve them soon.  _From @Flameborn on April 4, 2017 10:17_\n\nCurrently, Caddy-FileManager's default template does not provide enough information to screen readers.\r\nFor example, in the file list, folders or files are not marked up properly as a link or a clickable element. Items are presented as DIV elements. Without proper ARIA markup, screen readers see this as standard text and are unable to click on any item to navigate to the selected folder, or download a file. Keyboard users are also unable to focus these items via the tab key.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution is to use standard links, or if this is not possible due to styling, ARIA roles. See this article: https://www.marcozehe.de/2013/04/24/easy-aria-tip-6-making-clickables-accessible/\r\n\r\nScreen reader support can be tested via VoiceOver under MAcOS and iOS, (cmd+f5, settings/general/accessibility/VoiceOver) or with the open source NVDA https://www.nvaccess.org under Windows.\n\n_Copied from original issue: hacdias/filemanager-old#80_ Hello @Flameborn!

But if you have got some spare time, you could make a Pull Request if you want \ud83d\ude04  Just reviewed the whole HTML code and added the roles and ARIA markup wherever I thought it was needed.

I don't know what may be causing that error, but maybe something to do with the single quotes and double quotes, not sure. I think I'll have this improved in the next version, so it will be easier for you to set multiple commands \ud83d\ude04  @chouzar, the new version allows you to set multiple commands (on the global settings page) and they will be executed by order \ud83d\ude04   Hello, thanks for pointing this out @benmarte  \ud83d\ude04   Thanks \ud83d\ude04   before_publish and after_publish are only run when you publish a _new_ post from the interface and not when the website is generated during the startup of Caddy.

That's a really good idea, to create some hooks before and after some actions. What if:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbefore_save\r\nafter_save\r\nbefore_publish\r\nafter_publish\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Yes, the options I mentioned are meant to be general, not only for Sandstorm. But, are you using `caddy-hugo` publish button? If not, you could just use `filemanager` instead. The only differences between `hugo` and `filemanager` is that the first can run the hugo commands, create files based on the archetypes, schedule and publish. `filemanager` doesn't have those options.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll probably create this options on `filemanager`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbefore_save\r\nafter_save\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd these will be specific to `hugo` plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbefore_publish\r\nafter_publish\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter each of those directives/options you'll be able to put a command. And I'm thinking about creating a variable (probably `$file`) that we'll be replaced with the file path. It can be useful for some cases.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? You're welcome! I'll mark this as a todo. I'll do it when I can \ud83d\ude04  I just made a few changes. Can you build it from source and try, please? \ud83d\ude04  Closing since it's already done.

That is the same error as #97. I already fixed that but it's not currently available on caddyserver.com . Could you build Caddy from source with this plugin to check if everything runs as expected?

Just tell me the plugins, the OS and the architecture and I'll send you the binary file. @valentinvieriu  @valentinvieriu Unfortunately I can't. Only @mholt knows. Let's wait for his answer. There was a new release of Caddy. The plugins weren't updated I think. Sorry for that. I think @mholt will make some changes in the build server soon related to the plugins and then I can deploy the fixed immediately.\r\n\r\nIf you want, you can tell me your OS and Architecture and the plugins you want and I'll build the binary for you with the newest things.  Hey @Jamesits! I just searched about it and it does not seem a problem with Hugo, nor Caddy, nor Go. Please check this [issue on docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9868) to see if it helps please. I knew you weren't using Docker. I just sent you that issue because I thought the answers could help.\r\n\r\nBy the way, when does that happen? When it supposedly runs the `hugo` binary? Okay @Jamesits, but let me know if it happens again.  Sorry!!!! I've updated the syntax in the last version but the docs weren't updated. Try `flag watch`.\n\n_Pinging_ @mholt\n Yup. Glad it worked :smiley: \n  Strange... Have you received any error in the Developer Console? \n Hey @brasilikum! On browser, right click in the page and select \"Inspect\".

I'm really happy to hear that from you. It's always enjoyable to know that someone is using what we've done and that it is really helping somehow. I hope you use it for long! Do you have any suggestions? :smile: \n  Hey @anxiousmodernman! Sorry, I've fixed this bug some weeks ago, but the new version is not still available for download at caddyserver.com.\n\n_Just pinging @mholt_\n Awesome :smile: \n  I'm not sure if this would work, but try `basicauth /admin/content user pass`. I think it will conflict with the the \"super admin\" but try anyway.\n So, I don't know any way to do this right now. How is the auth plugin @mholt? I've read that there was someone doing it.\n I'm making huge updates to File Manager to support a bit of Access Permissions. Check out the closed recent closed issues. I'll update this plugin in some time to work with those permissions.\n Check out #87. It seems to be working fine :P\n  Hello @icyleaf!\n\nThat was already fixed and in the meanwhile I've also changed how caddy-hugo installs hugo. The problem is that the version on caddyserver.com is not up to date with this repository yet.\n\nWhat you can do right now is build it from source OR download the hugo binary to $HOME/.caddy/bin/hugo. \n\nThanks :)\n  Right now, as you probably now, caddy-hugo is downloading Hugo binaries from GitHub releases and then it checks its hash. That means that Hugo hashes need to be hard-coded and, sometimes, Hugo release file names change and I've to change the installer code as well.\n\n**The idea:**\n\nBefore building the Caddy executable with hugo plugin, a script would be run. That script would use GitHub api to check the latest tag of Hugo (which is the latest stable version). Replace installer.go placeholder with the latest version.\n\nThen, it would go to `$GOPATH/github.com/spf13/hugo` and check if it already has the latest tag. If it has, it would proceed. If it doesn't, `go get -u` must be run.\n\nAfter that, `go build` would be executed and the produced file gzipped. That file would be embedded in the final executable using go-bindata. In the end, it would be easier to install the latest version.\n\nWhat do you think?\n @mholt and @abiosoft: what do you think?\n I need to ask you one thing: is `go generate` executed before _each_ build, or after the server starts?\n And is it executed after setting GOOS and GOARCH or before? @mholt \n I would like you to take a look at [this](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/build/main.go) and [this](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/installer.go) files when you have some time. :D\n Done! Done! And done! :D Let's see what's going to happen. I ask you @mholt to check if everything on build/main.go can be executed on the build server (I think it can).\n Gonna close this because from now on, the user **must** install hugo for themselves.\n  Hello! Thanks for that. Can you move this issue to [caddy-filemanager](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-filemanager/issues)? Hugo will be built on top of File Manager and file manager will be on charge of editing files.\n  Hey @chesedo!\n\nThanks for reporting this. I had already noticed this problem and it will be fixed ASAP. I'm working in a major update for caddy-hugo and this will be fixed then ;)\n\nI hope when the version 0.9 of Caddy is officially released, the new version of this plugin will also be released.\n\nThanks again. I'll leave this issue open until I have the confirmation that it is fixed! \n Sure, I'll be waiting for them ;)\n I've checked and it's fixed. ;)\n Yup. \n  Thanks ;)\n  Thank you. \n  This issue contemplates the next moves on caddy-hugo plugin. The list bellow shows what am I going to do next, and after that, there is a bigger explanation for each item.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Theme picker\r\n- [x] Website preview\r\n- [x] Image, audio and video preview.\r\n- [x] Add support for multiple hugo sites within the same site.\r\n\r\n### Image, audio and video preview\r\n\r\n~~This one is very obvious. The same way we can click on a file on Browse to edit it, we could do the same to preview images/audio and video.~~\r\n\r\n**Edit:** this is part of the integration with File Manager plugin.\r\n### Page/post preview mode\r\n\r\n~~This page preview mode would replace the current \"preview\" button that exists on the Edit screen. After clicking on \"Preview\", the plugin would generate the site in a temporary path. That temporary path would be served at, for example, `/admin/preview/`, and you would be able to preview your page with your theme, styles, css and so on. Then, after closing the tab/window, the plugin would delete the temporary folder.~~ Hey @brasilikum \n\nI agree with you on one thing: I think generally iframes are an ugly thing. Even in this case. The most similar thing I think that would work would be the `temp` directory regenerating himself after those 2 seconds of not-typing and showing up a kind of a popup asking to go to `temp` dir. \n\nI don't really know what is the best approach here. Do you have any other idea besides the iframe?\n Yup, I agree with you in the auto recompile thing. I just don't like the\niframe. But we'll find a way! :D\n Hey @fedelibre! Sorry, but the functionality is unavailable for now. This issue was referring an older version. I'll update this. Although, I'll create a preview mode soon for the whole website.  Thanks for reporting this ;) I'll change it ASAP.\n Fixed.\n  Hey! Can you post your config.toml file here, pls?\n You downloaded from Caddyserver.com or built it from source?\n I guess the problem (with caddy-hugo) might be in this kind of \"[params.postAmount]\". Right now, I've some school exams, but I'll try to resolve this then. Hope you don't mind :(\n Thanks ;)\n  Thanks ;)\n  I hate the first error. It means that that function was unexported bu the Hugo team. I've opened an [issue](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/2105). \n\n@mholt how should I fix the second part? With the removal of \"Root\" what should I do to set the path where the Browse middleware must act?\n Thanks @mholt. Now we've to wait for Hugo team.\n Have you updated caddy-hugo? I already changed the field root to config \"section\". o.O\n What should I do @mholt? Do I have to create an http.FileSystem for the root path? Before I just had to set the root path in browse! :P \n Check it now please ;)\n\n**p.s.:** don't update Hugo repository because its latest version unexported a function I need.\n You're welcome. Now we just have to wait for Hugo guys to unexport the function. I think I'm going to make a PR.\n Hey @Bitti09 \n\nThey already exported the needed function. Please update the repositories and try again ;)\n\nLet me know if it works! \n Don't worry about that error. You must run that command after cloning/updating the repository. It's in the readme.\n\nI'll close the issue then ;) I hope you like the web interface for Hugo! If you have some suggestions, tell me!\n  @mholt idea\n Sure!\n Hey @faddat!\n\nThis is not the right place to say that (ahah), but congratulations and thanks at the same time. If you want to say something else, send me an email or open a new issue, ok?\n\nHave a nice day!\n I am closing this issue for now because of its inactivity and the fact that this plugin would be useless without the admin interface. We can discuss how it couldn't be in the future.\n  Hello @justrjlewis \n- Are you using caddy-hugo with an existent website or creating a new one?\n- If you already have an existent website, please show me your Caddyfile.\n- Paste here the result of `ls` command on the root of your Hugo website.\n\nThe error you're getting is very strange. What's the URL of the page you are trying to access?\n Anything new?\n This issue will be closed due to its inactivity. If the error persists, just comment.\n  Hey @klingtnet \n\nWhat's the version of Hugo that's installed on your computer? Was it downloaded when you first executed Caddy with caddy-hugo plugin?\n\n**Edit:**\n\nIf your Caddy configuration file is:\n\n```\nlocalhost:80\nroot /tmp/hugo\nhugo\n```\n\nAnd your are running on /tmp, you mean: the static files will be on /tmp/hugo and Hugo website will be created/or is on /tmp. I think you wanted to mean something like this:\n\n```\nlocalhost:80\nroot /tmp/hugo/public\nhugo /tmp/hugo\n```\n\nTry it, please.\n > The version from there seems to be fairly old.\n\nWhat? From where? The latest stable version is 0.15!\n\n---\n\nAs you can see [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/hugo/hugo.go#L54), the plugin checks if Hugo is in the Path. If so, it will return its path and use that version of Hugo. If it doesn't, he will check if it's on `$HOME/.caddy/bin`. If it doesn't, it will be downloaded from GitHub releases (the same that are available at gohugo.io) to that location and return the path of the executable.\n\n---\n\nRemove everything from `$HOME/.caddy/bin` and remove all the Hugo executables you have on your computer.\n\nThe error you are receiving doesn't make any sense because the command that is being executed is `hugo new site /tmp/hugo --force`. Unless you have a very old version on your computer that doesn't support `--force` flag, I can't understand what's going on.\n\n---\n\nDownload Caddy + Caddy-Hugo from [this repository](https://dl.bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo/1457123545/) because [caddyserver.com](http://caddyserver.com) still doesn't have the latest updates of caddy-hugo. **CC:** @mholt\n Hey @klingtnet \n\nDownload `caddy` + `caddy-hugo` from [here](https://dl.bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo). Download from the last folder. The version on caddyserver.com has that bug. I'm waiting for @mholt to update it whenever he can.\n\nThe link above only has caddy-hugo plugin. It's automatically built every time this repository is updated. I fixed that yesterday, so the executables in that link should work.\n\nAnd thanks! I'll add a \"p\".\n Why those double dots? The link should be `https://dl.bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo/1457123545/caddy_linux_amd64.tar.gz` and not `https://dl.bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo/1457123545/:caddy_linux_amd64.tar.gz`. I can open it here.\n O.o I see. Don't know why they use the colon on download page. \n\nSure :)\n Thanks. I'll change that [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/hugo/hugo.go#L106). :)\n After [this](https://travis-ci.org/hacdias/caddy-hugo/builds/113905151) build is finished, the new binaries will be available on the same link as the others.\n\nI hope you enjoy the admin interface! And help building it, if you want to =D\n New v. already available! :D\n > You forget to set the executable of ~/.caddy/bin/hugo after downloading it. After setting the flag, everything works fine!\n\nI'm not unedrstanding. Forget what? The chmod stuff?\n Oh... I'll add that :D Thanks. I think I can close the issue now. Enjoy it!\n You're welcome!\n  Hello @amsoell!\n\nI'm really sorry to hear about that :(. It is probably the same thing as #58. Try executing caddy with `-log stderr` as a flag, then try to save the file and paste the error here (that is shown in the console).\n > The XHR request (which goes to https://mettle.works/admin/edit/content/about.md) comes back with the following:\n\nWhen you say that, you are telling that when you click the button \"Save\" that is what the response is, or that is just the source code of that page?\n Hello @amsoell!\n\nPlease check out [this build](https://bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo/1457861772/view#files/caddy-hugo/1457861772) and see if it works now, please!\n\n**Edit**: new build link.\n I'll close this issue because it was related to #58, which is already closed.\n  When you say out of the box you mean you downloaded it from http://caddyserver.com, right?\n Strange. No one had that problem until now. Are you sure your js is enabled? If so, please check the console on developer tools (normally F12) on the browser and check if there are any errors. If so, paste them here pls.\n Also, please check the source of those pages and check if the buttons have the data-type attribute defined somehow like they are in this file: https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/templates/editor.tmpl#L49 .\n No, the source of /admin/edit/content/home.md PLS. \n Why are you using browse directive? Try removing it please. \n Please give me the source-code of `http://localhost:2020/admin/edit/content/home.md` so I can check if Go vars are being evaluated, pls.\n\nAnd please check the **console** of developer tools of your browser to see if there is any error there or some valuable information.\n\n![screenshot 103](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5447088/13381492/a482c91c-de55-11e5-8178-537c0a8ec062.png)\n Hmm... I've only tested it on Chrome and Edge. Later today I'll test it on other browsers.\n\nI didn't want the source code of \"home.md\"! I want the source of the page when editing the file. Open the URL, right click on the page, and there should be a button which says \" View Source\". But if it works on Chrome, the problem is not in there. It might be in JavaScript. \n\nSo, can you please check the console of developer tools on Firefox. The console, not the headers of the response.\n\n![Ff dev tools](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5599/web-console-messages-highlighted.png)\n _Just for reference: it works on Firefox for Android._\n Hey @bronzehedwick!

I've implemented a new idea that's already on `master` but not detailed in the docs.\n\nInstead of:\n\n```\nhugo /srv {\n   cmd \"--buildDrafts --watch --baseURL=http://localhost:2015/ --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 2015\"\n}\n```\n\nTry:\n\n```\nhugo /srv {\n   buildDrafts\n   watch \n   baseURL http://localhost:2015/ \n   bind 0.0.0.0 \n   port 2015\n}\n```\n\nHope it helps!\n Hey,\n\nThat's everything you have on your caddyfile?\n\nIt should be something like this:\n\n```\n0.0.0.0:2015\n\nroot /srv/public\nhugo /srv {\n   buildDrafts\n   watch \n   baseURL http://localhost:2015/ \n}\n```\n\nTry that pls :D\n @ludovicc any news?\n Hmm... Nope. Try to update the repository and if that doesn't work, let's see what @mholt knows.\n Even /admin?\n Strange... So that's not a problem of caddy-hugo I think. What's your configuration? And your Caddyfile?\n Try this Caddyfile:\n\n```\n0.0.0.0:7011\n\ntls off\nroot      /srv/public\nhugo /srv {\n   buildDrafts\n   watch\n   baseURL http://localhost:7011/\n}\n```\n\nRun `/home/go/bin/caddydev --source /home/go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo` and go to `http://localhost:7011/` and `http://localhost:7011/admin` to try it out, please. \n\nHope it helps!\n I've made some changes in the way caddy-hugo uses Hugo and now it installs Hugo in a different folder. I'll see if I can fix that bug and then you test it.\n\nIt's strange that your OS is not using Caddyfile. Are you running caddy in the same folder as caddyfile? That's really strange. \n\nAnyway, the second way you run is doing what's expected. There's just a bug I need to fix. What's your OS?\n One more thing: I started using Bintray with Travis so the people who don't want to download the source code and compile it from source can still use and test the latest versions of caddy-hugo. If you're only using this plugin, you can download the build from here: https://dl.bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo/ . Always open the last folder, which is the one that has a bigger number. And download the version for your OS.\n\nI'm really sorry for this situation :(\n Try using the latest version on Bintray, please.\n Hello!\n\nTry with the version of caddyserver.com please. It's the latest version of\ncaddy-hugo like on Bintray, but it has the other plugins and stuff more\nupdated.\n\nIf that error persists, you should contact @mholt.\n\nThanks :)\nOn Apr 6, 2016 12:47 AM, \"Ludovic Claude\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hello, sorry for the long delay.

If you have some suggestions to make it better, don't forget to tell me!\n  Hello!\n\nThat \"error\" is normal. That's why you have to execute `go generate` then. It can be skipped, or is it preventing you to continue?\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThat error happens because there's no `.go` file in `assets` when you clone the repository. When you execute `go generate` the following commands are executed:\n\n``` bash\ngo get github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata\ngo install github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/go-bindata\ngo-bindata -pkg assets -o assets/assets.go templates/ assets/css/ assets/js/ assets/fonts/\n```\n\nThe last one will build an `assets.go` file in `assets`. After that, you should not receive that error anymore.\n\n**A question**\n\nWhy are you using \"FROM abiosoft/caddy\" if \"mholt/caddy\" is the actual repository and \"abiosoft/caddy\" is just a fork?\n Thank you too! I'll close this issue for now. When you publish the Docker file, let we know! :)\n\nHave a nice day!\n  Hey @faddat \n\nI think that some more examples could be added to the documentation, but only the ones which use caddy-hugo.\n I'll close this issue due to its inactivity. If you want to continue this issue, I'll be available to answer :+1: \n ? Is that a correction or a question? :+1: confused. Sorry :|\n  Hello @bzerangue! Like to hear that someone is using (or trying to use) caddy-hugo! Hope you enjoy and hope @faddat can help! Thanks for helping @faddat :)\n You're welcome :D\n I've never done that so I can't help you with that :(\n I'll close this issue right now because of the lack of the activity on it. If you want to reopen it, just tell me. :+1: \n  Of course! =D\n Yes, but due to the Hugo architecture the watch option won't work on multi site installations (there's no way to create an Hugo instance). \n No, you can simply go to the admin interface, open something like config or\na post and click \"Publish\". I'll add a Build button to the interface.\nOn Feb 19, 2016 10:53 PM, \"Benjamin Hagels\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> damn :-/ that is a little bit anoying so I have to restart caddy-hugo each\n> time I update or add content?!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/issues/47#issuecomment-186440731.\n  Instead of writing `args \"--buildFuture true\"` we could write: `buildFuture true`, and so on. \n  **Note**: https://github.com/spf13/hugo/blob/master/create/content.go#L35\n Ahah... I just commented that so I can remember what to see later. It's a note for myself. Don't worry :)\n   Maybe. We've to choose a very simple one. There is a [website](http://themes.gohugo.io/) with some Hugo themes.\n Hey @jlsjonas,\n\nThanks for your suggestion. It seems to be a very good choice indeed. That what I'll probably do. Now I'm   a little busy with school exams but later this month I'll do that. \n\n---\n\nI've also another idea: create a \"section\" in the interface where you can download themes and install them into your website. Do you like it?\n Moved to #77.\n  After some research, the but might be on Hugo. The static files are copied correctly, but the path for rendering is not correct.\n\nFound out that to fix this bug, I've to make a change on Hugo source.\n  I see (more or less). But right now we can only support one user. How would this be useful?\n\n_P.S.: I don't know if you're using the version on this repository or the version that can be downloaded at caddyserver.com. I recommend you to build it from source to try out the new version which is very less buggy._\n I'll leave this issue open because it can be something to try in the future. If you want to do so, go on and try. :+1: \n\nRight now I think there is a new auth plugin for caddy in the kiln so I'll wait for that. But you can test it!\n The problem is that I don't even know how to try it. I would have to investigate the code of Leaps and then see how could it be integrated with caddy-hugo. Anyway, I recommend you to read this [article](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) which may help you :D You'll get it!\n You're welcome!\n The main contente text areas are the ones with `name=\"content\"` like [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/templates/editor.tmpl#L43) and [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/templates/editor.tmpl#L22). \n\nJust for reference, you've to know that those text areas are not visible, they're hidden. What is shown is the Ace Editor (see [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/master/assets/src/js/editor.js#L16)).\n\nGo on and try it! :D\n Execute first `cd /root/caddy-hugo & go generate`.\n @faddat I will close this issue for now because I think `caddy-hugo` doesn't need this heavy app right now. But I'll leave a reference to #39. Maybe in the future :)\n  Related to #38 \n Merge with #38\n  Create a new login system.\n I would like something that allowed me to have more than one user.\n That's great. Do you know if those issues are being worked?\n I'll close this for now due its inactivity.\n  @derekperkins I will add the screenshots soon. Thanks for the suggestion. I have new ideas to add to this plugin :)\n\n@mholt maybe.\n  Thank you!\n  Is it being used already? cc @mholt \n @mholt let me know when should the directive be changed! :)\n Thanks ;) I'll change it.\n  Taking in account that #27 will come true in a short time from now, it would be nice to make the data fields with costum types, like `datetime` for `date`, `textarea` for `description`, etc. See [gohugo.io/content/front-matter/](http://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) to know more.\n Hi @adprof \n\n~~I liked your (very extensive :P) opinion and created a simple [roadmap](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/wiki/Roadmap). I don't have too much to say, just that the plugin currently has a toml/yaml/json editor. I hope this weekend I can do more things.~~\n\n**Edit 6 feb 2016:** I think issues is a good place to have the plans for new features. I don't think we need a full featured roadmap.\n  There's something else here that can be a problem: right now, the plugin can be used with more static website generators, but if it was directed only to Hugo it could be more optimized and have better functionalities both in the editor (because we know the default front matter fields) and in the back end because we know the default website structure. It's easier. It can be optimized, it can be easily better.\n\nI know I thought before it was better to support many website generators, but there's nothing good which bring bad things too. Almost nothing. We have to see the pros and cons. Do you prefer having the plugin optimized for Hugo with better specific functionalities or do you prefer it to be general and support multiple static generators?\n\nWhat do you think in restricting this editor to Hugo?\n So I can do that. I think it's better too. When I've time, I will change it to \"caddy-hugo\" again and make the changes on csddyserver.com repo and in the registry. I'll wait for your answer @mholt!\n\nSure it will keeo being modular as it is @adprof!\n @mholt yes. Why waiting? =P I think it wouldn't be a great problem.\n **TODO**: change the directive and repository name.\n  Hi @adprof \n\nI can't really understand what's wrong. But there's a trick: see the developer console! It might help! Then send me the error so we can analyse it.\n\nYes, I'm opened to all suggestions!\n\nHave a nice day,\n Eheh thanks.\n\nI've been using Chrome and IE and I haven't had those problems. 404... that's very strange because it only occurs with Safari and I can't test. I don't have any OS X machine I can use.\n @mholt yup. I'll see when I've them. In the weekend probably.\n\nI saw [this](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/blob/master/frontmatter/frontmatter.go#L55) and I think I've some improvements to do. I'm assuming that in all object-like-things there is a string-name to identify the content. Eg:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"obj1\": {\n    \"string1\": something,\n    \"string2\": something\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhere \"string1\" and \"string2\" are the \"identifiers\". May I create something like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"obj1\": {\n    1: something,\n    2: something\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor even like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"obj1\": {\n    something,\n    something\n  }\n}\n```\n\n?\n @mholt @adprof I think it's returning 404 [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/blob/master/editor/post.go#L55). And it shouldn't be 404, it should be 400 bad request. I've to change that,\n @adprof may you build it from source? If so and if you keep getting 404, we will know that it is [this](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/blob/master/editor/post.go#L83) 404.\n Sure, I'm going to sleep now. (GMT+1 very similar ahah)\n Please take all a look [here](https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/issues/27).\n @mholt \n @adprof Hi! It's been a while. Do you still receive those errors?\n @adprof the fix was deployed and it's now available for download! Try it out and let me know if you still receive the error!\n Hi @adprof \n\nRelatively to the first error, I have to see that. I know what the problem is. The problem is that, right now, the plugin only supports dates in \"2006-01-02 15:04:05-07:00\" so it can schedule posts.\n\nSecond error: please send me your json/toml/whatever-your-frontmatter-is so I can see where the problem is. If your frontmatter is valid, I have to check where I have the error.\n\nFor the third error we need to call @mholt!\n\nI'll not be home this weekend so I'm not going to do anything in the next three days but I'll wait for your answer.\n\nHave a nice day!\n  Caddyfile should be placed where the Hugo files are placed. The `root` is the content served and `content` is what's probably causing the main problem. This directive is used to know which folder contains the main content, the markdown files. It will only affect the links, nothing else.\n It's not that clear in the docs, sorry. I'll change it as soon as I can. Let me know if this was the misunderstanding or if it's something else.\n Oh... I see. What do you want is to have a a directive where you put the path of the \"static-generator-content-things\" and it runs there, isn't it? I could (or even you!) create that, it could be optional. You do you think?\n @adzeitor it can't be root because those are the served files. What do you suggest?\n Oh... I figured out that `content` is always the same as `root`. So, I can remove `content` variable and add `workdir` or something like that.\n So:\n\n```\nroot [path/to/public/folder]\ncms [path/to/execute/things] {\n    styles  file\n    command cmd\n    args    args...\n}\n```\n\nI'm thinking about merging command and args too. What do you think?\n I'm making the changes and I found out that there's a mistake here. content =/= public. Content is the folder where are the content files like pages and posts. Public is the generated HTML. So the content directive should be used.\n I'll update the docs to make that clearer.\n Try executing from source to see if is good!\n  Thanks for reporting that strange bug. I'll see.\n Another bug: the things are just saving at the second \"Save\". In the first one they're not saving. Is this happening there too?\n\n**Edit**: fixed this, and I already saw that this is one of your problems ;)\n @mholt Hmmm... But that's strange. Why the characters \"??\"?\n Apparently, when saving, it sends `\"{\"content\":\"??\\r\\n\"}\"` to the server, so the problem might be there! No? \n Fixed, thanks @adzeitor and @mholt!!! In 24hrs it will be available on caddyserver.com\n", "text_all_count": 34245, "text_word_token": ["glinuz", "please", "answer", "the", "question", "suggested", "in", "the", "template", "form", "in",

It is successfully deployed, serving my folders. I can happily move files around my file system and access my files remotely.\r\nI have one folder, that does not have an unusual name, that just hangs when I double click on it. It never errors, and it never returns a listing of the directory, and nothing is logged to the log.\r\nPermissions of this folder appear to be identical to other folders around it that are successfully served. SELinux is disabled on the system.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nI expected the folder to be served successfully, or for an explanatory log entry to be logged explaining the problem.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce?**\r\nNot easily reproduceable yet since it seems to be specific to this folder on my system, and we don't yet understand why. I'd like to be able to turn up the logging in some manner to get an understanding of what it is failing on.\r\n Why not paste your folder name here? You said a lot but without your folder name, nobody can solve your problem. The folder name is /media/Media/Resilio. I should add that, as the name suggests, this folder is synced via the Resilio software to other machines; but so are other folders that I can successfully view. So it's possible it's related to the Resilio software is some way, but unlikely given that all other work. Understood that it is difficult to triage. I'm running the docker build; I'll have to have a go at building the code myself to then try adding the print statements you suggest. And yes, I've checked the log, just a note that the server is listening to the port. Thanks anyway.\r\nI'll open a new issue if I get it built, logged and have something more specific to report.  Updated with a DockerHubInfo file.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nPlease explain the changes you made here.\r\nIf the feature changes current behaviour, explain why your solution is better.\r\n\r\n#528 Updated with a document to copy into the information areas of DockerHub for the repo. \r\n\r\n:rotating_light: Before submitting your PR, please read [community](https://github.com/filebrowser/community), and indicate which issues (in any of the repos) are either fixed or closed by this PR.

Is LDAP or AD or Kerberos authentication supported?  I could not find any documentation on it.  If not, are there any plans in the future to support these types of authentication? \r\n  **Description**\r\nI\u2019m trying to mount filebrowser behind a caddy `proxy /files/ http://filebrowser`. I don\u2019t need any authentication, so I passed `command: \"--auth.method='none' --baseurl /files\"` in my `docker-compose.yml`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nfilebrowser should not ask for any username or password\r\n\r\n**What is happening instead?**\r\nfilebrowser asks for username + password\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce?**\r\n```yml\r\nversion: '3.5'\r\nservices:\r\n  filebrowser:\r\n    image: filebrowser/filebrowser\r\n    command: \"--auth.method='none' --baseurl /files\"\r\n    depends_on:\r\n      - proxy\r\n  proxy:\r\n    image: abiosoft/caddy\r\n    ports:\r\n      - '80:80'\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - './Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Caddyfile\r\nhttp://0.0.0.0:80 {\r\n    proxy /files http://filebrowser\r\n}\r\n``` @1138-4EB latest version that\u2019s published to Docker.\r\n\r\nWhere do I find the log files? Same issue here, I'm using `File Browser version (dae992d4)`\r\n\r\nI was not able to identify the issue with this auth flag, I had to revert to previous version `v1.10.0` in `docker-compose.yml` `image` parameters\r\n\r\n```\r\n  filebrowser:\r\n    container_name: eris_filebrowser\r\n    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:v1.10.0\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /opt/platform:/srv\r\n      - ./config/tmp_filebrowser/database.db:/etc/database.db\r\n      - ./config/tmp_filebrowser/config.json:/config.json\r\n``` Sorry to piggy back on this issue, but I'm trying to debug an issue i have with access to one particular folder. How can turn I up the verbosity of the log, either using the config.json file or in a command line option? Hi @1138-4EB \r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm using this `docker-compose` config (various paths might be uncorrect, I'm just copy/pasting the current working version without the v1.10.0 tag, but it's was setup more or less like this):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  filebrowser:\r\n    container_name: eris_filebrowser\r\n    image: filebrowser/filebrowser\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /opt/platform:/srv\r\n      - /opt/platform/filebrowser/database.db:/etc/database.db\r\n      - ./config/filebrowser/config.json:/config.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `config.json` contains the `auth.method='none'` parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  auth: {\r\n    method: 'none'\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll try to reproduce the complete setup of my defunc config when I've got time.\r\nI remember trying to use the `command` parameter in `docker-compose` to force the `auth-method`, but I had the same issue. Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a folder that filebrowser won't open, and nothing (beyond the fact that filebrowser is listening to the port) is recorded in the log. Otherwise it performs wonderfully. I'll file a separate issue for specific guidance on how to resolve.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRoss  This project is not under active development, i.e., new features won't be created and deep bugs might be hard to be fixed. A small set of developers is taking care of keeping it building and fixing small issues.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in becoming a maintainer of this project, please let us know through this issue and start contributing. It would be awesome for the more than 3000 people that starred this project! @hacdias that is SO SAD... =(\r\n\r\nI wish i had any knowledge in this programing field, to help... \r\n\r\nAnyways, thank you for all the hard-work  @yurividal \ud83d\ude1e Do you need help maintaining the Go side or the web client side more? @rhjmoore both. All help is welcome \ud83d\ude04  Hey, I'll see if I can carve up some time to help out. I had a few commits way back when this was starting out but haven't touched the source in a while. If you want to make me a maintainer I can dig through the issues and get rid of the noise of people who don't understand how web or golang or whatever works... @ericvolp12 awesome that you want to contribute! You can start by looking at the issues and creating PRs. We'll only give push access to someone who has a history on this repository. You can start building one right now! \ud83d\ude03  Hey @hacdias it'd be nice if I had the permissions required to close or label issues as I dig through the backlog. I do have a history of commits to the project for the record. I would like to help, I haven't developed with Go or Vue but I do have full stack experience that I can try to help with. After looking through the issue log is there any priority or order that you would want things worked on? @dtwilliams10 hello! Thanks \ud83d\ude04 hope you contribute. There's no special order. Just bugs >>>> features. I can help as well for the frontend part! I have some commit with minor fixes! So sad because the tool is so good!   **Description**\r\n\r\nrelate to #314 \r\n\r\nI've realize it's some go file can't edit, and some file can.\r\nDuring read the code, I think the problem is at `GetFileType` method.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the go file(even it's small) can be correctly recognize, and I have tested it.\r\n\r\nTest by using two go file, one is small then 512 bytes, the other is over 512 bytes, this change make both file editable through UI.\r\n  See https://github.com/pierrec/lz4/issues/33.\r\n\r\n@1138-4EB could you update the Go version around, please?  **Is your feature request related to a problem?

That page is for internal and I thought this issue report site also internal page when I reported the issue. You can ignore this issue.  In v1.10.0 I was able to use `--baseurl` to host the FB in a specific route.\r\nIn master I am not able longer to do that because the url of the assets does not include baseurl and are linked from root.\r\n\r\nWith v1.10.0 (right behavior):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 filebrowser/filebrowser:v1.10.0 --baseurl /b --port 80\r\n$ curl localhost:8080/b\r\n... <script type=text/javascript src=\"/b/static/js/app.c9e23184bf5593511600.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith latest (broken):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 filebrowser/filebrowser:latest --baseurl /b --port 80\r\n$ curl localhost:8080/b\r\n... <script type=text/javascript src=\"/static/js/app.c9e23184bf5593511600.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nbrowser will request the invalid url `localhost:8080/static/js/app.c9e23184bf5593511600.js`\r\n @bcardiff thanks for reporting! It is fixed now.\r\n\r\n@hacdias, the underlying issue was that in #506 all the config keys where lowercased, in order to have them automatically identified by `viper.BindPFlags`. However, I forgot to change them in the frontend. Therefore, the fix to this issue was to rename `BaseURL` in `frontend/build/config.js`: https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/commit/3ae9e518a30ec59e307f60f0225b8eb04433be08. Can you think of any other similar required modification off the top of your head? FYI the latest docker image created Sep 8 still does not have this fix. You're right - the html returned by curl has the correct urls. The problem now is that not all the code from the js has the right url basename.  I'll find an example... ![screenshot from 2018-09-25 18-16-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2676579/46046631-c9ca5f80-c0ef-11e8-9a6f-e5b76c82524e.png)\r\n\r\nSo when I go to http://mydomain.com/files  I'm redirected to http://mydomain.com/login?redirect=%2Ffiles%2F  plus of course all the 404's you see on the debug panel - every 404 is because there's a request being sent without the `files/` base directory.\r\n\r\nI too am running with docker and passing `-b /files` at the command. The fix should be just search for every instance of [BaseURL](https://github.com/filebrowser/frontend/search?q=BaseURL) in the frontend code and replace it with `baseurl`.\r\n\r\nI would do this, but I know so little about Go and the frameworks used here. No idea how to even test this. Okay - thanks for all the documentation!  Quick question: is there a `Dockerfile` that builds the whole thing? Rather than building on the host and moving the binary to the docker.  **Description**\r\nFilebrowser shows symbolic links to folders as files.\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nSymbolic links to folders showing as folders.\r\n\r\n**What is happening instead?**\r\nSymbolic links shown as files\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIs this a glitch?

Related to #367 and #446. Is it possible to use this simple progress bar with text below it? https://dzwillia.github.io/vue-simple-progress/examples/ I have made a demo but it looks ugly. \r\n![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5954203/46126393-a1fa0980-c25f-11e8-8e38-0bc8c83f686c.png)\r\n  Closes #484 \r\n\r\nFix search not working because the path was in lower case and resulted in a 404 when clinking on the search result. \r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix while a better solution is found for the fuzzy search / case insensitive search problems described in #252 and #415.  @hugomassing, can you please rebase this PR on top of master? Note that `http/websockets.go` is now located at `lib/http/websockets.go`. Looks good now :) Thanks @hugomassing! :wave:\r\n\r\nJust a note for future contributions: I ran `gofmt lib/http/websockets.go` on top of your commit in order to remove some whitespaces. I have just installed this great piece of software using the install script method:\r\ncurl -fsSL https://filebrowser.github.io/get.sh | bash\r\n\r\nVersion is 1.10 but I still have the search issue with results being all lower case so the links are not found. How can I include the fix as stated above? @1138-4EB Thanks for your response. Do you have any idea when the next release will be published?\r\n\r\nI have tried using the install files build_all.sh but I am hitting problem after problem with installing go, rice, and everything else.\r\n\r\nI have managed to install docker. I am on Debian 8.10 Jessie. How do I use that docker image that you referred to? I have no experience with docker I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nThanks. @1138-4EB Sorry I found the documentation. I'll try the docker method. Thanks. @1138-4EB I have as a rule of thumb not to force push to master and I believe it's a best practice so we shouldn't rebase it.\r\n\r\nHow would we do the first one?  I'm using filebrowser in a configuration where I have some administrative accounts who submit content and multiple shared user account with different permission levels who access said content. I would like to be able to disable user submitted stylesheets as I would like all shared accounts to have the same user experience and prevent some users to disrupt the experience of other users they share the account with.\r\n\r\nA good way to handle that would be to allow or disallow stylesheet submission per user.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it would be good to disable custom stylesheets for the whole filebrowser instance, if that is easier to do in the meantime.\r\n\r\nIf I have missed that feature in the current version, I apologise for the wrong request. I looked into the documentation and that feature seemed missing to me.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration and the work you did on filebrowser.\r\n [offtopic] Speaking of stylesheets, could we have some examples of nice stylesheet mods, maybe posted to the readme? @yurividal, see e.g. #208. Also, please consider opening a new issue to discuss either documenting style mods (probably in [filebrowser/community](https://github.com/filebrowser/community)) (also suggested in #407) or enhancing filebrowser to support multiple 'default' CSS and a dropdown select for each user. #506 is merged now :smile:.  Close #360, close #497 and close #504.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept to use cobra in order to provide subcommands. Two main subcommands are provided:\r\n\r\n- `filebrowser serve` or `filebrowser server` keeps the existing behaviour. The root command, `filebrowser`, is aliased to this.\r\n- `filebrowser db` is expected to be used for interacting with de DB. See #489.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n- Sources related to the core are moved to subdir `lib`.\r\n- Subdir `cmd` is removed.\r\n- Subdir `cli` is created, which is a standard cobra structure.\r\n- #497 and #504 are merged.\r\n- Deprecated flags are added. See https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/497#discussion_r209428120.\r\n- [`viper.BindPFlags`](https://godoc.org/github.com/spf13/viper#BindPFlags) is used in order to reduce the verbosity in `serve.go`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Add proper short and long descriptions to the subcommands.\r\n- [x] Make `filebrowser` behave as `filebrowser serve`, accepting the same flags. (spf13/cobra#725)\r\n- [x] Add subcommand `version` that behaves as `--version`. (spf13/cobra#724)\r\n- [x] Modify the build scripts accordingly. I.e., rice-box is moved to subdir `lib` too.\r\n- [x] Modify caddy plugins accordingly. (filebrowser/caddy#11)\r\n- [x] Modify `initConfig`? See #508. @hacdias, could you have a look and probably try this? It should be functionally equivalent to what we have now. Note that #497 is already merged here. @Equim-chan, related to https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/497#issuecomment-411954704, see the 'db upgrade' placeholder added here. @hacdias, yes, it is ready for review. Notes:\r\n\r\n- Please, check `Short` and `Long` fields of (sub)commands (`root.go`, `serve.go`, `db.go` and `version.go` in subdir `cli`).\r\n- filebrowser/caddy is not updated, yet. So, it will break as soon as this PR is merged.\r\n- I had problems with `dep ensure -vendor-only`. Then, I removed `dep`, `Gopkg*` and `vendor`, in order to use `go mod` (see #496). However, building with go mod is failing too. So, this PR does not use any vendoring/module tool right now. `go get -v ./...` is used.\r\n  - I created a new branch in filebrowser/docker-dev, in order to try Go 1.11. The corresponding image is available as `filebrowser/dev:rc`: https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/dev/tags/\r\n\r\n@Equim-chan, could you please try to rebase #496 on top of this PR?  This PR replaces the `(untracked)` version with the first eight characters of the commit that is being built when `USE_DOCKER=\"true\" ./build/build_all.sh` is used. If executed outside of a docker container envvar `COMMIT_SHA` can be set to any value and that will be used.\r\n\r\nSince `build.sh` is not executed when commits are tagged, this does not apply to releses.\r\n\r\nAlso, `dep ensure --update` was executed in order to update `Gopkg.lock`. I don't know why, this and some other PRs (#497, #504) are not being executed in travis.  https://hub.docker.com/r/hacdias/filebrowser/\r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/hacdias/filemanager/\r\n\r\nboth give 404 Hi @yaskor! We changed it yesterday and we have not updated all the docs and references yet. It is now available in [hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser](https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser/). However, note that it is a \"rolling\" image, until we push the first release with the new CI scheme.\r\n\r\nSee #450 and #492.\r\n\r\nBTW, we would be so glad if you told us where you found (now) invalid references, so that we can fix them. Thx for the quick answer.\r\n\r\nIf found the reference on the offical [github](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) readme.md\r\n\r\n> Moreover, the previously unique repo was split into multiple pieces: frontend, logo, caddy... At the same time, the official docker image was changed to **hacdias/filebrowser**. Users are encouraged to check their sources and update them accordingly. looking forward for the new docker image @Emeryao, as commented above, it is already available at https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser/tags/. What do you mean? can we push a *versioned* tag to docker hub besides of the `latest` ? Yes. We are about to do it (see https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/497#issuecomment-411584661). But travis is not detecting our pushes right now, so we need to wait (see https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/505#issuecomment-411622451 and https://www.traviscistatus.com/). @Emeryao tag `v1.10.0` is available now. See https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser/tags/  Close #498.\r\n\r\nThe new repo works already. However, I cannot set the docker credentials. While I can access https://travis-ci.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/settings, when I try https://travis-ci.com/filebrowser/docker-dev/settings I get `There was an error while loading data`. @hacdias are permissions in docker-dev different from this repo?  This PR modifies `caddy/parser/parser.go`, which is removed in #492.\r\n\r\n- If #492 is merged first, these changes need to be done in `filebrowser/caddy` directly.\r\n- If this PR is merged first, changes need to be done in `filebrowser/caddy` as soon (or before) #492 is merged.  A thought before actually reviewing it: since this is a breaking change, and the filebrowser docker image is automatically updated now, should we publish a release (`v.1.10.0) before merging this? That would provide users, who cannot update their configs ATM, a stable image to use.\r\n\r\nNOTE: when we publish a release now, a single docker image is created and it is tagged twice (`latest` and `$version`). So, if we publish a release now and a breaking one in a few days, we will have one tagged `v.1.10.0` and another one tagged `v2.0.0` and `latest`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I don't know if the changes introduced in #485 should be considered breaking changes too. Might need a db mitigation, since the structure has been changed? @hacdias, can you please have a look at the comment about [BindPFlags](https://godoc.org/github.com/spf13/viper#BindPFlags) in #506?\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't know if you prefer to merge this PR on its own, or as part of #506, since it is almost ready too.  Please note that this also updates bbolt to v1.3.1-coreos.6, instead of v1.3.0 which was released two years ago (I think it's a bug in semver).\r\n\r\nAfter Go1.11 release maybe we can drop Gopkg.{toml,lock}? It looks interesting, but I have to read about it. Anyway, Go 1.11 is in beta yet, so we have some margin until we use it. @Equim-chan, should you have any handy reference about this `go.mod` approach, I'll like to have a look at it. I.e., are these produced by [golang/dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) or is there a new tool? It's a new tool and already embedded into go1.11 toolchain. It can parse Gopkg.lock (and it's how this commit comes from). The biggest benefit, in my opinion, is that you don't need to put it under GOPATH any more. I've seen there are too many newcomers stumbled on GOPATH when they try to build something in Go.\r\n According to https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#semantic-import-versioning, we might need to take some further action to support `go.mod` considering the upcoming breaking changes (see #497, #506).\r\n\r\nAlso I did need to update `Gopkg.lock` in a different branch (see #505).\r\n\r\n@Equim-chan could you please have a look at these? Now #505 and #506 (including #497) are merged.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, as commented in https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/506#issuecomment-414395143:\r\n\r\n> I had problems with `dep ensure -vendor-only`. Then, I removed `dep`, `Gopkg*` and `vendor`, in order to use `go mod`. However, building with `go mod` is failing too. So, master does not use any vendoring/module tool right now. `go get -v ./...` is used.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should we create a new branch `v2` and move all the commits after `v1.10.0` there?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> @Equim-chan:\r\n> The biggest benefit, in my opinion, is that you don't need to put it under GOPATH any more.\r\n\r\nI tried this, but it seems that we need to add import comments to most of the sources for it to work.\r\n\r\nEDIT: we are using go1.11 now (#530), but new modules are not being used, because the project is mounted in he GOPATH inside the docker container, and `GO111MODULE=on` is unset.  I didn't know about it. It seems very useful. Especially because it allows us to have a common entrypoint to manage all the repositories in the project. Let's use it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am still missing some messaging/chat service. Does waffle.io provide any or does it rely on slack? I have used both slack and gitter previously, and I think that the latter provides a better integration with GitHub. However, the difference might be negligible depending on how does waffle integrate with slack. Anyway, I'd be also ok with some IRC room. While I was organizing the content in waffle.io, I realized that it is quite similar to GitHub projects. @hacdias, did you try this? What advantages does waffle offer?\r\n\r\nAlthough I cannot see the 'Projects' tab here (yet), I think you can enable it by creating one in https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/projects. wafle existed before github added the projects functionality.\r\ngithub projects is much better and easier and integrates of course with github issues.                                                                                        Hi Henrique,FYI you're sending this to the wrong Ching Lin, you must have picked the wrong GitHub user.

Sorry for the late, I build with this branch\r\n\r\nNo error box shows, with setting ( after save command )\r\n\r\nSince I can't edit  go suffix file, I can't test it\r\n\r\nI try the searchbox to execute \"gofmt -w main.go\", it seems doesn't work, only show a file found, content doens't change.\r\n\r\n@hacdias \r\n\r\n @chinglinwen thanks for testing. This PR should not affect the execution of commands without wildcards. Can you, please, try `$gofmt -w main.go` and `$gofmt -w ./*` in the 'search' box? It shows ```This is a not supported command.``` for both commands provided above. @1138-4EB  Also my primary concern is automatic format on save. not execute command to format on search box manually. ( hope this helps to understand the issue #466  )\r\n\r\n@1138-4EB @hacdias  > It shows `This is a not supported command`. for both commands provided above.\r\n\r\nThis means that you didn't add `gofmt` to the list of supported commands. You need to do it either in the config file or in the user settings. Please, do it and try again.\r\n\r\n> Also my primary concern is automatic format on save. not execute command to format on search box manually.\r\n\r\nIf/when it works in the search box, it should also work in the hook (automatic execution on save).  The current tagging/CI proposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Some maintainer/user needs to manually tag a commit in `filebrowser/frontend` (which is a submodule of `filebrowser/filebrowser`).\r\n- Then, he/she executes `build/release.sh` in `filebrowser/filebrowser`:\r\n  - If the requested tag/semver exists in frontend, it is checked out. If not, it exits.\r\n  - The version is substituted in `filebrowser/filebrowser/filebrowser.go`.\r\n  - A commit is added.\r\n  - The commit is tagged.\r\n  - The tag is pushed.\r\n\r\nWhen a tag is pushed to `filebrowser/filebrowser`, if the test stage in travis-ci is successful, a deployment stage is executed. In this one, the release binaries are built with goreleaser and rice-box is pushed to `filebrowser/caddy` with `build/push_ricebox.sh`:\r\n\r\n- A branch named `update-rice-box` is created from `master`.\r\n- `assets/rice-box.go` is replaced.\r\n- A commit is added.\r\n- The commit is tagged.\r\n- The branch and tag are pushed to `filebrowser/caddy`.\r\n\r\nA maintainer is required in order to merge/squash/rebase this single commit to master.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a PR could be automatically created by using the GitHub REST API: https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#create-a-pull-request. However, although creating the PR is quite easy, handling the authentication seems to be not so straightforward: https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/. Therefore, I prefer to keep it apart from this PR.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@hacdias, please let know if you find any pending work to be done here. Sure. I'll check it now.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nIt is fixed. It was a quite stupid error on my side: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7641  According to alecthomas/gometalinter#505 `gas` was renamed to `gosec`. So, we don't need `gas` anymore. I think you can suppress this specific case with /* #nosec */. It is very usefull to have gosec linter because it can catch some uncommon cases.  This issue summarizes the requested features for the workflow related to the configuration file, the database, how user profiles are set up, etc. Some of these are frequently shown in multiple issues and this is an effort to put them all together. It is also the place where we can add and track new related requests. \r\n\r\nThere was some previous discussion about this in #371. However, rather than merging the configuration file and the database, I think that the configuration file should be extended ([#381issuecomment-373983968](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/381#issuecomment-373983968)) to be used as a template to initialize/set the database (probably periodically).\r\n\r\n## Config file\r\n\r\n- [x] Define multiple users in the config file [#371issuecomment-373985636](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/371#issuecomment-373985636).

I'd like to notice, that you do not need database at all. Why not just keep it simple ? Because I tried nextcloud and had horrible experience. So all that is needed is just filebrowser, why not to use srandard unix/linux users and theirs home folders ?  This should more or less solve #471  - As I am a Java guy there may be several things to improve so a review is more than welcome :) \r\n\r\nIf this PR is fine I would create some documentation afterwards. A quick test can e.g. be done by using a browser plugin like: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modify-headers-for-google/innpjfdalfhpcoinfnehdnbkglpmogdi Docker change has been reverted\r\ngofmt has been executed. Overall LGTM. Please, have a look at the comments and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nBTW, did you build and test it with your proxy setup? Since I cannot test it, it is important that you test and try to 'break' it.\r\n\r\n@hacdias, can you please have a look and let us know if you find any caveat? Hello together,\r\n\r\nI hopefully implemented all the requested changes.\r\n\r\n@1138-4EB : I have build a new image locally and did some tests. Both, proxy and default seem to work as expected. You can also do a quick test on your own as stated earlier. Simply start the with \"--auth.method proxy\" and request its page with a \"X-Forwarded-User\" Header set to an existing username (e.g. admin). \r\n\r\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modify-headers-for-google/innpjfdalfhpcoinfnehdnbkglpmogdi\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMarvin Hello @hacdias , hello @1138-4EB ,\r\n\r\nso I renamed the var and prepared the \"auth.method\" config to accept \"none\" as a parameter, but I do not feel like I am the correct person to remove the \"no-auth\" option right now, because I am not that deep in your code and I am not aware of side effects at all :/ Maybe this can be done in a separate pull request from someone who is more into the filebrowser code than me?  **Description**\r\nI searched this File3.txt and is able to find but presented file is file3.txt\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nShould be able to find (yes this is achieved) however the presented file (in URL) is in lowercase. Upon clicking I get this \"This location can't be reached\".\r\n\r\n I did a quick fix for this in #515.\r\n\r\nlet me know if this is OK for you! The fix by @hugomassing is merged in master now. It will be available in the next release. Meanwhile, you can try the latest docker image (`filebrowser/filebrowser:latest`).  **Description**\r\nI have a server error everytime I upload something even with a command like \"git status\"\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nNo error\r\n\r\n**What is happening instead?**\r\nError 500 (notification in the right bottom)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI want to update a file after it's uploaded\r\n\r\n**Files**\r\nevery file is affected I tried with with one I build myself today, but it was not working with version 1.8 too. I'm quite a beginner with Caddy, but everything is working great so maybe the mistake is on my side I tried this as well and got it working. I guess the issue is that it produced a 500 when the command resulted in a crash. Also I tried to make the $FILE environnement variable working after an Upload, with no success. I would love to treat every file uploaded with a script. Can you help me with this one? I just did `echo $FILE` on After Upload and the terminal output was just $FILE. Okay and if I want to execute a command like `lltag --yes --mp3v2 --no-tagging --rename \"%a - %t\" $FILE`?    Uh, thanks \ud83d\ude04   If I using ReCaptcha with Docker it is not possible to verify the captcha on login. I got the following error in the logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPost https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify: x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found a very similar problem here: https://github.com/zenazn/goji/issues/126\r\nAs suggested linking the certificate CRT from host system into container solves my problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -v '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt' ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I think it's more clean to install the root certificates in the docker image.  It would be nice to have a button to check for update releases of file filebrowser.  Perhaps a message saying a new version is available, or even a button to automatically download and replace the previous version. I'm currently searching a way to update only filebrowser with caddy? Is there a way to update without installing caddy again?  I have installed it with https://filebrowser.github.io/get.sh, how can I update filebrowser for the moment? @VLEFF running the script again should overwrite it with the latest version from https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/releases/latest.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the binary should be located in `/usr/local/bin`. So you can just replace it manually. Download the tarball for your arch from the link above, extract it and copy/move the file named `filebrowser`.  files should be sorted with natural sort order This is cool @DeyV! Thanks for it. Could you just do this PR based on master and not on develop? for future - can You tell as what is Your branch strategy?  Hey guys. It would be great to have an option to hide or show hidden files. (files that start with .).\r\n\r\nMaybe a user-based policy for such. Hello @yurividal - that option already exists. Altough you need to set it for each individual user. If you go to a user's settings, there will be an \"allow/disallow/rules\" section. There's an example in there showing how to hide . files. Thank you! Can't believe I missed that.\r\n\r\nHere is my block list now:\r\n\r\ndisallow regex [\\\\\\/]\\..+\r\ndisallow regex \\$RECYCLE\\.BIN\r\ndisallow regex System\\sVolume\\sInformation Great idea. Ctrl Alt H or Ctrl shift H would really be awesome. @1138-4EB not it Chrome Related #355.  Hello together and thank you for providing this great project.\r\n\r\nwe are planning to use \"filebrowser\" internally, but sadly miss some features. The first one is SSO. All our tools are running behind a proxy which handles the authentication and authorization. If the user is allowed to access the tool, the proxy sets the \"X-Forwarded-User\" header (and some additional ones). The tools are looking for this header and fully trust its value if found - Meaning that if the header is provided, the user will automatically be logged in.\r\n\r\nI already did a quick and dirty POC with \"filebrowser\" and from my current point of view it could be implemented quite easily. My first questions would be: \r\n- Is this feature also interesting for the filebrowser project?\r\n- Are there things we would need to take care of right now when we would implement this?\r\n\r\nThank you and best regards\r\n Hay @1138-4EB , \r\n\r\n> If I don't get it wrong, what you are suggesting would be potentially dangerous [..] If not, any user providing any X-Forwarded-User will have access\r\n\r\nYes, if e.g. the proxy is not correctly configured or if the proxy can be bypassed. So I am more than fine with adding a warning about that feature.\r\n\r\n> Should you be willing to contribute a PR to implement this\r\n\r\nThat would be the plan :) My question here would be: How do you want the options to look like? Should I create a new option \"proxy-auth\" in parallel to \"no-auth\" or should there be something like \"auth\" that can be set to:\r\n- no-auth\r\n- proxy-auth\r\n- ... maybe more to come?\r\n\r\n> Be explicit about the risk in the codebase.\r\nMake it default to be disabled.\r\nAdd a message/log when filebrowser starts in this mode.\r\n\r\nFine with those :)\r\n\r\n> Consider adding an example configuration for a proxy such as NGINX or Traefik (or the one you are actually using).\r\n\r\nHm, the setup is often not possible or quite complex with common proxy projects out of the box (see e.g. https://serverfault.com/questions/537425/ldap-auth-proxy-adding-headers-according-to-ldap-groups ). I would say that it is not the best idea to simply provide snippets that can be copy & pasted by people who do not know what they are doing. Would it be fine for you to simply describe the idea/concept behind this feature and do a PR for: https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io after the feature is available ? \r\n\r\nThanks and best regards  ### Instructions (remove before submitting):\r\n\r\n1.

Some videos (mostly .mkv) don't stream correctly in browsers because of missing audio codecs. Often in Chrome, the video will play, but no audio.\r\n\r\nNormally, I'd just download the video, but that isn't the best option if the video file is huge and you just want to watch it _right now_ \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nMy thought would be to have an option in the UI somewhere to make a URL for streaming in VLC (maybe in the File information modal?). VLC supports network streaming, so it should be a fix for the codec issue.\r\n\r\nFirst problem is that if auth is enabled, VLC gets 403s when trying to load the video, obviously.\r\n\r\nTo get around auth, maybe a session token for the video can be generated and appended to the URL that would skip auth for that request? reencode file format in backgroud  by ffmpeg? That would work too. Does ffmpeg support streaming encoding or would it need to finish the whole file first? Because the thing about streaming is that it makes it available right away without waiting. I do not know if ffmpeg support it, but there are already solutions for streaming. I think this project should aim into SOC devices like raspbery pi, or ROCK64. There is already similar project called nextcloud, but it works so slow on that devices.

This would implement some kind of real time transcoding in the background that would effectively have us recreating Plex. I can see an argument for being able to generate a streamable link that you can stick into VLC so I think that may be a good solution.\r\n\r\nThe auth issues here are a little annoying, but potentially generating a limited time use link with some sort of one-off token attached to it could be feasible maybe. Yup, a JWT as a URL parameter would be fine for the auth.\r\n\r\nAlso, real-time background work already happens with filebrowser, i.e. zipping up a bunch of files when downloading a whole folder. It's not like it doesn't have support for that class of thing already. I honestly don't think it would be that much extra work to add transcoding, honestly. E.g. https://github.com/xfrr/goffmpeg That library seems to be for full transcodes, not streaming live transcoded content anywhere. I'm just saying it's a really annoying and tough problem that has been solved at places like Twitch but not open sourced and would be redoing a lot of work that Plex does. Linking a library doesn't mean it is easy :P  Hi,\r\nIt would be a nice feature to be able to automatically link subtitles to videos (I'm currently using Substital Chrome extension, but it would be better if it was native)\r\n\r\nI see here that it is a standard HTML5 feature : https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_track.asp Of course!  ### Instructions (remove before submitting):\r\n\r\n1.

If the user wants to block them, they just need to add that rule (which is one of the examples so the user doesn't even need to think about how to do it). See #455.  Hi,\r\n\r\nPlease, we are using Filemanager for a small community needs.\r\n\r\nWe installed Filemanager in Ubuntu, but we need to launch it every time we want to use it; How can it be launched everytime?\r\n\r\nThank's  I created a systemd service for filebrowser.

We could try what you suggest and if it works, go for it. But we have to be careful about [Caddy build server](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/399#issuecomment-401593860). It sounds good to me. Thanks for all your work here \ud83d\ude03 It's being amazing!  When I used filebrowser on my mobliephone, I found it's hard to enter a folder or open a txt file or play a mp4 , because you need to double-click the folder/file **very very very** quickly. \r\n\r\nThere is a issue #419 @ikwyl6 asked for the same feature.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great project and I hope it`s easy to use on the moblie device :)  ### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nPer user website root for Hugo. Optionally setting the users scope as the website root -\r\nper user account rather than (only) globally. Basically having the option to allow multiple\r\nusers each edit their own Hugo sites, or in the case of multi-sites (e.g. i18n) having\r\nmultiple users work on different instances of the same site. E.g. example.co.uk, example.cn,\r\nexample.jp\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nEither an option to set a specific website root per user account - or an option to call the\r\nusers scope as the website root. \r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n\r\nNothing unexpected. Just doesn't work unless the global website root points to a working\r\nHugo directory - meaning all users can only work on the same Hugo site. \r\nUnless I missed something despite checking the documentation and the issues / questions list.\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\n\r\nBy trying the same as above.\r\n Addition 1:\r\n\r\nAnd the option to manually set the preview path e.g.\r\n\r\nhttps://filemanagerhomeurl.com/username/preview/\r\n\r\nAddition 2:\r\n\r\nThe option to turn off Preview on a per-user basis I do understand that running separate instances also solves this problem, but it would be nice to just have to run and monitor one instance.\r\n\r\nI did find a bug however:\r\n\r\nrunning instance for example.com\r\n\r\ninstance is started at hugo website root.\r\n\r\ncreate extra user with scope ./content\r\n\r\nif user does hugo new - the file gets created, but file browser automatically tries\r\nto navigate to /content/newfile.md - which isn't possible for the new user as content\r\nis their scope. \r\n\r\nI reckon a 'if scope includes ./content then directly open the file'  or go to sub directory within ./content and open file - should be added. Hi @1138-4EB, - thank you for your reply, much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI will look into contributing although it will require me to pick up Go as a language (until now I have done most of my developing in C and C++), but I agree this project deserves more manpower.\r\n\r\nAs for the first issue - I did not mean using Hugo as the server, but using File Browser as a service for multiple users to work on multiple Hugo sites. At the moment one instance of File Browser can only define one Hugo website root - meaning all users can only work on the same site. My request was if a configuration option could be added where an administrator can specify a website root for each user individually - that can't be much of a problem I'm sure. So there aren't any configuration files, errors etc to supply in this case as its default behaviour of File Browser as it stands at the moment, not an error.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is about how File Browser handles opening a new document after it is created by Hugo; for example:\r\n\r\nAdministrator adds a 2nd user - with scope ./content within the website root.\r\nWhen the 2nd user then clicks \"Hugo New\" (make a new entry / post) the default behaviour of File Browser is then to automatically open the file - which it does by opening /websiteroot/content/newfile.\r\nAs the 2nd user however is limited to content in the first place, from his / her session it would be \r\n/content/newfile. Thus the file doesn't open and results in an error. The user can then of course navigate back to their home directory and open the file anyway, but said error would create confusion and / frustration for users limited to the content section. In other words, limiting the scope of secondary users to the content section (so they can't accidentally edit / delete other files crucial to the Hugo project) means that creating new documents will always lead to an error first before they can manually navigate to the file and open it for editing. \r\nThus I suggested that an \"if content is included in the scope of users session then remove website root from the file path prior to opening the file\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should indeed open a new issue for the second point. Hi @1138-4EB - Thanks for all the information, I'll look into Go for sure, perhaps it will come in handy for some other projects as well as contributing to this one. As for Vue.js - I'm a total noob when it comes to working with JavaScript frameworks (only do some minimal vanilla javascript from time to time), so that will probably take me more time to pick up.\r\n\r\nPasted the 2nd problem into a new issue.   How to compile a mipsel verison for openwrt routers ?\r\nAnyone tried this?\r\nAppreciated. Hey @ifengchao! I haven't added mips and misple versions to automatic releases because I've had some compiling issues in the past in the most recent versions. You can take a look at [Go's docs](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling) to see how to cross compile. Basically you just have to set the env variable for the platform and architecture and then compile as you'd normally do. @hacdias Thanks you for your advice.  Added the screenshots. Would you like to make the GIF? \ud83d\ude04    What problem do these changes solve?  Fixed error access to inside the docker container. Fixed error access to inside the docker container. @1138-4EB It is not necessary to change from scratch to ubuntu. This is done in order to have access inside the container docker (there is not shell in scratch) and is not relevant to # 300. Maybe I need to make a new PR? Thank you for fixing the permissions issue. Is it possible to merge just that and move the discussion about switching from scratch to ubuntu elsewhere? I need the permissions fix ASAP. @1138-4EB , good, i revert changes for Dockerfile. Can you merge this PR?\r\nThanks. Thanks @tokvv  I'll release a new minor/patch version of File Browser today with the latest bug fixes. :+1: @hacdias @tokvv   ```\r\nHypriotOS/armv7: pirate@black-pearl in ~ \r\n$ docker run --rm -i \\\r\n  -v /mnt/storage/store:/store \\\r\n  -v /mnt/storage/filemanager/config.json:/config.json \\\r\n  -v /mnt/storage/filemanager/database.db:/database.db \\\r\n  -e USER_ID=1000 \\\r\n  -e GROUP_ID=1000 \\\r\n  -p 3000:80 \\\r\n  hacdias/filebrowser\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome seconds pass by...\r\n\r\n```\r\nstandard_init_linux.go:190: exec user process caused \"exec format error\"\r\n\r\nHypriotOS/armv7: pirate@black-pearl in ~\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nHypriotOS/armv7: pirate@black-pearl in ~\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux black-pearl 4.14.34-hypriotos-v7+ #1 SMP Sun Apr 22 14:57:31 UTC 2018 armv7l GNU/Linux\r\nHypriotOS/armv7: pirate@black-pearl in ~\r\n$ docker -v\r\nDocker version 18.04.0-ce, build 3d479c0\r\nHypriotOS/armv7: pirate@black-pearl in ~\r\n$ docker-compose -v\r\ndocker-compose version 1.21.1, build 5a3f1a3\r\n```\r\n Why can't you just slightly change [one line](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/e3162e7170f329f37a13f7a64c2b760086e7692d/Dockerfile#L7) in Dockerfile by yourself? @pltanton Yes, I guess I could.

Is there a way to do it via the config.json file? @1138-4EB thank you. any methodology that allows a persistent password. \r\na password file would be good. @1138-4EB thank you. apologies if I oversimplified. Just commenting from a user perspective as frankly cant add much in the way of process. \r\n\r\nAs it stands, it's open. So some (initial) solution is progress.\r\n\r\nI tried blocking it with nginx password feature, but strangely enough it only works on Safari browsers. Meaning, when the dialog box pops up on chrome, firefox, etc and I type the user and password it effectively ignores it and keeps asking for it. Not the case with Safari.

I dont use caddy server\r\n  Greetings, \r\n\r\nThis is an excellent project and I would like to ask if it would be possible to allow some custom branding in either the command line or config files?  It would be great if it was possible to point the application to a custom favicon file and logo file when integrating this software into a client solution.  The other item that would be nice to have would be the option to turn off hyperlinks.  Having FileBrowser there is fine, but the hyperlink causes issues with external web calls.  It would be great if the \"Help\" under that was a slightly larger font.  I am not trying to be picky as I have no ability right now to contribute to the code other than cups of coffee.  However, as suggested by Henrique, I am posting these feature requests here.\r\n\r\nThank you for keeping the package fairly light weight as I am currently testing this as a solution for a problem on some embedded devices that I need to remotely manage a couple of files in a very \"user friendly\" fashion.\r\n\r\nBest wishes all!\r\n\r\nC I have accomplished some of the above through customs CSS in the various profiles.  This is adequate for my needs but not eloquent.  Since not all browsers treat overlay css the same (MS Edge...) it doesn't behave the same all the time.  I would still love to see some options in the code itself to support the above versus relying on css.  Best wishes, C  Status update: after checking out the code and seeing what we need to change, this will actually be more complicated than I thought it would be initially and will require some changes here and on the frontend repository. Starting this on https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/456. This is not as easy as it seems since we would need to be passing files from the server-side and dump them into `index.html`. It would be easier to have instructions telling people how to build a custom build with custom Branding but that would also require the user to maintain it's own build system (we could create a script to simplify).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @1138-4EB @cashflys?  Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\nCaddy 0.10.12+http.filemanager 1.7\r\n\r\nWhat did you expect to see?\r\nCan you provide one-click mode? \r\nThat is more consistent with the way you browse web.\r\n\r\n Is single click option available via the config file? I notice the use of a single click especially on iPhone when browsing and loading folders.  Can someone point me in the direction of where I could find the code for the touch/click events? I'm not familiar with caddy or rice, etc. But if you tell me generally, I may be able to find this info for a patch. Or where the mobile http/css is created from. Thanks.  How can I keep file browser working after closing my Laptop terminal? nohup(1) You say?

I prefer the right one, but I think the blue can be a bit brighter maybe? (not really good at visual design) Do you really choose that from the left (light blue). And which part do you think I need to change? The color it? How about this?. If you like it, I will send you the original file.\r\n\r\n![filebrowser2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39112161/40092289-ba5ef1bc-58e6-11e8-9e27-118e564be251.png)\r\n Okay, I've uploaded that logo to the drive, you can download it on this link :\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GR2WDhgNPZ4ANg00ggo9vf_PGXhfKCeb What do you mean: The outside circle I change to a light blue color and the inner circle I change to white color, is that so?

Sure, Here you can get it:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjsUgQeRCR6d1OeSVoePJYR4fvcsqMeN\r\n\r\nI feel happy if you use this logo on your project.\r\n sorry, but the old icon was better.. One thing that I forgot to ask @timonss that is very important: under which license is the Logo? @1138-4EB thanks, already saved the old version of [icon.svg](https://github.com/DeAlexPesh/filebrowser-frontend-ru/blob/master/logo.svg)\r\nThe new logo has too many small details, in the future it will turn into a headache.. Yes, I have to take care of #420!\r\n\r\n@1138-4EB yup, I created that repo to centralize our logo assets there instead of leaving them in this repo and with time we can create the versions for each purpose. @1138-4EB .Very happy to contribute with you. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01  ### 1. \r\nyes.  \r\nFile Browser v1.7.0\r\n### 2. \r\n```\r\nfilemanager /fm /mnt/sdb7/tmp/ {\r\n    database            /mnt/sdb7/tmp/caddy/fm1.db\r\n    #no_auth\r\n    recaptcha_key       \"\"\r\n    recaptcha_secret    \"\"\r\n    alternative_recaptcha\r\n    locale              zh-cn\r\n    allow_commands      false\r\n    allow_edit          false\r\n    allow_new           true\r\n    #allow_publish       true\r\n    #commands            cmd1 cmd2...\r\n    css                 /mnt/sdb7/tmp/caddy/d.css\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n if i am inside a directory link i cant copy up from that directory  ### 3.

This is the commit that changed previous LF endings to CRLF (oct 30): https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/commit/99c8c92c6c6d1225380dbbfc5b61d4263a129156#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8  Close #311.\r\nClose #312.\r\nSee filebrowser/frontend#7.  The README doesn't say what the relationship with Caddy is.\r\n\r\nPage https://filebrowser.github.io/quick-start/ desn't say whether other WebDAV servers are supported. FileBrowser (given its command line nature) is a server on localhost?   The screenshot shows a domain name of `https://filemanager.web`. That is something in your `/etc/hosts` file routing to `127.0.0.1` ?\r\n\r\nMuch is unclear, despite the effort you've gone to in the documentation. OK, so couldn't install on an Apache somewhere? Nor a Nginx.  I could imagine wanting to do so, and host other apps on other directories within the same server. Fine, documentation could be better if it were extended to say \"File Browser is not a WebDAV server, it is a standalone server-side web application that allows management of the files in a directory on the server. You can proxy from Apache/Nginx to it, but it maintains it's own user/password system\"  I found no info about how one should proceed to modify the frontend and rebuild filebrowser. It seems that `package.json` is used, which requires to push resources either to the npm or to a git repo. Moreover, because `node_modules` is removed in `build.sh`, any local changes are deleted.\r\n\r\nThis PR follows a different approach. `frontend` is expected to be a subdir of this repo, but ignored through `.gitignore`. When `build.sh` is executed, the frontend is cloned if not present. `dist` is always cleared. Then, dependencies of the frontend are downloaded/updated and the frontend is built. Last, because the path to the rice box is changed in ` filebrowser.go`, the content of `dist` can be packed directly.\r\n\r\nFor those users that don't want to install nodejs and npm/yarn locally, `build_in_docker.sh` is provided. It runs a `golang:alpine` container, installs the required dependencies and executes `build.sh`. Indeed, an image name `hacdias/filebrowser:dev` can be provided, in order to avoid installing the tools each time. Well, it is not necessarily simpler/easier. Indeed, the objective of this issue/PR is to discuss it, as it seems that there is not info to help contribution (yet).\r\n\r\nRight now you assume that a contributor has `nodejs`, `npm`, `go`, `git` and docker. My final approach is to require `docker` and a `shell`. All the other (nodejs, npm/yarn, go and git) are distributed in a single container (`filebrowser/filebrowser:dev`): see [this](https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser/commit/49a8abdf41646d5a32711a3c6dc17fcba8b53efe) commit, that is one ahead of this PR.\r\n\r\nMy proposed workflow is: https://github.com/1138-4EB/community/blob/fa41dbb7036ee4958e0c4e16ad7eb0d0536f31dd/contributing.md If the user wants to install all the tools locally, `build.sh` can be used. If he/she wants to install nothing but docker, `build_in_docker.sh` produces exactly the same result. After the first execution of any of them, frontend will be checked out, so the user/contributor can edit any source (either from the frontend or the backend) and have everything rebuilt without internet connection.\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of downloading go dep and rice each time, these are part of the dev image. Moreover, when dep ensure is executed, the vendor folder is kept in the host, in order to avoid downloading all the dependencies each time.\r\n\r\nBesides, I find it really weird to use a package.json for the backend. Executing npm install in the filebrowser repo installs many resources in node_modules, apart from filebrowser-frontend, which is the single dependency. How are you supposed to edit something in the frontend and have it rebuilt along with the backend? Are you supposed to move to filebrowser/node_modules/filebrowser-frontend and run npm build there? Or do you edit the frontend in a different path, then push to GitHub and update from filebrowser?\r\n\r\nIn my proposal, frontend is a child of filebrowser, but it is directly cloned with git in a script. Therefore, the location is still fixed, but all the nodejs stuff is kept in frontend. On the whole, I find it more \"natural\" to move to subdir frontend in order to build the frontend and then move to filebrowser to build the backend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> .sh scripts don't run natively on Windows, for example.\r\n\r\nA GitHub user/contributer is likely to have Git for Windows, MinGW, MSYS2, Cygwin... On Windows 10 there is even the Linux Subsystem available. Furthermore, any docker container can be used to run a shell script. If you think that it is required, I can add the equivalent to `docker run --rm -tv $(pwd):/src -w /src -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock busybox sh -c \"./build_in_docker.sh` in PowerShell. > There is `npm link`/`yarn link` for this kind of cases.\r\n\r\nI didn't know about these. Then, if you prefer, I can revert https://github.com/1138-4EB/filebrowser/blob/3acc5fb43feabea42eefece9a4fda313b6155bbf/build.sh#L7-L15 and keep `package.json`. I still think that it can be slightly misleading, but that's just a very personal opinion. In the end, I think the most important contribution in this PR is to provide `build_in_docker.sh`, so that specific dependencies or compile sequences do no matter.\r\n\r\nLet's hear what @Equim-chan and others think about it! While I do agree the use of yarn is a great idea, I have several concerns about it.\r\n\r\n* May the new Dockerfile breaks the automatic build?\r\n* Is it a better idea to make frontend as a git submodule? Like, in this repo we make the frontend as a submodule locked on some release tag, and when developing we pull the submodule to its HEAD? When we are going to tag a release, we also tag the frontend and pull the submodule to the tag.\r\n > May the new Dockerfile breaks the automatic build?\r\n\r\nDo you mean the automatic build feature in hub.docker.com? If so, I think that you are ok, and this breaks it. There are two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n- Rename the Dockerfile I propose to Dockerfile.prod and keep an all-included Dockerfile to be used by hub.docker.com.\r\n- User travis-ci or any other CI service that allows to build and also run tests. On successful builds/tests, artifacts can be pushes to both GitHub releases and hub.docker.com.\r\n\r\nI like the second approach because it allows more flexibility and the local workflow can be reproduced. The first solution requires to keep two parallel workflows: an optimal one (from the network usage point of view) and the all-in-one.\r\n\r\nHowever, pushing images from travis from hub.docker.com requires to set a dockerid (user and password) through travis encrypted variables. It is a one-time configuration: https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/blob/master/dist/linux/travis-enc-dockerhub.sh\r\n\r\nBTW, a organization named `filebrowser` can be created in hub.docker.com, just as you did here. That would make it easier to provide both development and production images. Also, it'd be straightforward to provide multiple production images from travis, e.g., one based on scratch and another one based on alpine.\r\n\r\n> Is it a better idea to make frontend as a git submodule? Like, in this repo we make the frontend as a submodule locked on some release tag, and when developing we pull the submodule to its HEAD? When we are going to tag a release, we also tag the frontend and pull the submodule to the tag.\r\n\r\nI did not explicitly use the term 'submodule' because I have never used this feature of git. However, yes, I was thinking of a submodule when I moved `frontend` to be a subdir of `filebrowser`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout versions, note that the proposed changes include getting the latest available version of dep, not a hardcoded one. I don't know if this is ok or if you prefer to manually bump dependency versions. I'm starting to think that moving this project to its own organisation (#342) was not that a good idea. Since everything is now on different repositories, the development slowed down and it is actually harder to do.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to take back that decision, but I'm asking your opinion @1138-4EB and @Equim-chan. If we moved it back, I'd still leave the same people with Pull Access but we could also call it File Manager again, which was the original and better name.\r\n\r\nI'm just dropping some thoughts here. I'll wait for your opinion. *Sorry* for this delay. Now I finally have some time to dedicate to this project!\r\n\r\nYes, you could add me permission for that Docker Hub thing, but you can stay there too, of course. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n> Is goreleaser affected by any of these changes?\r\n\r\nI don't believe there are any issues with it.\r\n\r\n> How is publish.sh affected by these changes?\r\n\r\nI think it can remain the same.\r\n\r\n> Should we modify build_img.sh in order to programmatically produce two copies of dockerfiles/filebrowser? One based on scratch and another one based on alpine. Only the first line (FROM) needs to be changed with sed.\r\n\r\nHmm, why would we?\r\n\r\n> Should we provide ARM variants of the images? This can be applied to filebrowser/filebrowser and/or to filebrowser/dev.\r\n\r\nYes, but sometimes there are some problems compiling for some combinations of PLATFORM+ARM.\r\n\r\n> Right now, the latest versions of node_modules, vendor and dep are got. I don't know if this is desirable, or if it'd be better to use fixed/tagged versions and manually decide when to update dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe node_modules are set on the package.json so they are fixed. For Go, we have Gopkg. > There are some use cases where having a shell in the container is desirable. See #441 (comment) and #441 (comment). I would go with the last option: provide a single scratch image and document how to create others. But I am open to any discussion about it.\r\n\r\nI think the instructions are enough.\r\n\r\n> For node_modules, I was considering to add yarn.lock to the frontend repo. Just as we do with Gopkg.lock for the backend.\r\n\r\nSure. We just have to decide between yarn or npm. @1138-4EB just noticed you ignored rice-box. That is something I really wanted to do. Although, what is holding me back is Caddy: it can't build the dependencies on the fly on the build server.\r\n\r\nBefore merging this PR, we should create a repository which holds the content of [caddy](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/tree/master/caddy) folder and on each release, it must contain the most update `rice-box` possible.\r\n\r\nAltough I'm not sure if that's possible since `rice-box` was supposed to be part of the filebrowser package and not the caddy one. @1138-4EB caddy build server only `go get`s the repo so we have to work with that unfortunately. That's why I've been keeping rice-box on version control.\r\n\r\n> Indeed, this problem affects not only rice-box, but filebrowser as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf we have rice-box already compiled, we don't need the frontend on caddy build server. @1138-4EB  why use yarn instead of npm? *From https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/420#issuecomment-403294003:* I don't have any idea for the Caddy build server issue unless we keep \u00b4rice-box\u00b4 on the version control. @1138-4EB not sure if those issues are active on old versions but on npm 6.1.0 / node 10.6.0 works fine perhaps indicating the required node/npm version would be enough? @1138-4EB did you check if it works adding the \u00b4rice-box\u00b4 to filemanager/caddy only? @1138-4EB I'm not sure if Caddy server supports vendor folders either. Let us ask @mholt \ud83d\ude04  >  I'm not sure if Caddy server supports vendor folders either. Let us ask @mholt \ud83d\ude04\r\n\r\nIt sort of does, but with some caveats -- you have to be very careful that none of the vendored packages are vendored by Caddy itself or other plugins it is built with, and also make sure that the vendored packages don't export any types used by Caddy.\r\n\r\nKind of hoping/wondering if Go modules (vgo) will help solve the problem a little bit. All Caddy plugins are completely embedded into Caddy, rather than distributed separately. (If that helps to clarify.) I think I found a solution!\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run --rm -itw /go/src/github.com/filebrowser -p 2015:2015 golang:alpine sh -c \"$(cat test.sh)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `test.sh` is:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\napk update\r\napk add git vim\r\n\r\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser\r\nrm -rf filebrowser/caddy\r\n\r\ngit clone https://github.com/filebrowser/caddy\r\ncd caddy\r\ngo get -v ./...\r\n\r\nmv ../filebrowser/rice-box.go ./filemanager/\r\nsed -i.bak 's#package filebrowser#package filemanager#' ./filemanager/rice-box.go\r\n\r\ngo get -v github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy\r\ngo get -v github.com/caddyserver/builds\r\ncd /go/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy\r\ngo get -v ./...\r\n\r\nsed -i.bak 's#// This is where other plugins get plugged in (imported)#_ \"github.com/filebrowser/caddy/filemanager\"#' caddymain/run.go\r\n\r\ngo run build.go\r\n\r\necho \"Hello world!\" > index.html\r\n\r\n./caddy -host localhost filemanager\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think we can safely remove subdir `caddy` and `rice-box.go` from this repo, as long as `rice-box.go` is ensured to exist in `filebrowser/caddy/filemanager`. Now we need to decide how to update it when a new rice-box is built in travis:\r\n\r\n- Use a encrypted deploy key to update the file and create a commit in `filebrowser/caddy`. This is potentially dangerous, as we are giving travis write access to that repo. We can push it to a different branch. E.g., we keep the development related commits in `develop` and `master` is where the `rice-box.go` is added.\r\n- Deploy it to GitHub Releases of `filebrowser/frontend`. In order to support this, `build.go` in `mholt/caddy/caddy` should support copying the file at compile time. > I think the first solution is the best: a commit to a branch and create a Pull Request automatically. We'd just need to approve it.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, that's not possible. The scope of 'Deploy keys' is the repository. These can be read-only or read/write, as if it was any other contributor/admin. There is no option to allow writing to a single branch.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I don't know how to automatically create a PR. What I propose is to create a pair of SSH keys locally, upload the public one to GitHub (settings of repo filebrowser/caddy); then, encrypt the private one and add it to the codebase in filebrowser/filebrowser; last, remove the created pair so that it does not exist unencrypted anymore. I don know if this SSH key would allow to create a PR. I suppose that it can be done with GitHub's API, but I believe that it requires a different workflow (such as a personal access token).\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the behaviour you suggest, we would need to use two separate repos. The sources would be hosted in `filebrowser/caddy` and that's where the development would be done. Then, we would push to a different one, say `filebrowser/filemanager`. The latter would be a deployment-only repo (without issues or PRs), which means that we don't mind if the content is messed up, because we can always remove it without losing any relevant data.\r\n\r\nSee https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys\r\n\r\n> We just need to make sure that key isn't able to commit to master to prevent someone to change Travis.yml and make a change on a pull request.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed not to be a problem, because encrypted variables and files do not work for PRs from forks. The risk would be maintainers not being cautious. We should take care when accepting PRs that change the build procedure (i.e. what is executed in travis). See:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/\r\n- https://github.com/1138-4EB/ghdl-io/blob/master/travis/travis-enc-deploy.sh\r\n- https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests#Pull-Requests-and-Security-Restrictions\r\n\r\nNote that this is slightly different compared to how we encrypt docker credentials:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-encrypted-variables-in-travisyml\r\n\r\nHowever, the risks concerning PRs and possibly wanted pushes are the same.\r\n\r\n> That for Filemanager plugin. WHat about Hugo and Jekyll? Would we need to replicate the file on three directories?\r\n\r\nI have never used those plugins, so I don't know what's the interface. Do they rely on the GUI of filebrowser or do they just execute commands after an API request? > What if we create a user, like, FilebrowserBot, which has read and write access except to master?\r\n\r\nThat's a good idea. Indeed, it seems that [Machine users](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) are meant just for that. We can combine it with [branch restrictions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branch-restrictions/) in order to let the bot write to a single branch. Furthermore, should we create it, we could use it for hub.docker.com too.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need an e-mail account in order to register the bot both in GitHub and in Docker. @hacdias can you please handle it?\r\n\r\n> The other plugins are basically the same as filemanager's but with other functionalities enabled so they also need the assets to run.\r\n\r\nI made some additional tests:\r\n\r\nFirst, I added the rice-box in `/go/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy`, by slightly modifying the script I showed [above](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/pull/399#issuecomment-409804234). This works: [fb_caddy.sh.txt](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/files/2258761/fb_caddy.sh.txt)\r\n\r\nThen, I did the same, but plugging in the three plugins (filemanager, hugo and jekyll): [fb_caddy_all.sh.txt](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/files/2258765/fb_caddy_all.sh.txt). It is properly compiled too. Could you please check if the functionality is correct?\r\n\r\nNote that, even though it might work, it is not a desirable solution, because we cannot push to mholt/caddy. It is just a test to verify that it doesn't really matter in which package we add the rice-box. It is only required for it to be compiled once into the binary.\r\n\r\nI also tried adding it three times, once in each of the plugins: [fb_caddy_all_three.sh.txt](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/files/2258777/fb_caddy_all_three.sh.txt). This does not work. The same content is embedded three times. Therefore, it compiles ok, but it fails at runtime:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\npanic: EmbeddedBox with name `./node_modules/filebrowser-frontend/dist` exists already\r\n\r\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\r\ngithub.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/embedded.RegisterEmbeddedBox(0x1078559, 0x28, 0xc4201fda80)\r\n\t/go/src/github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/embedded/embedded.go:77 +0x18d\r\ngithub.com/filebrowser/caddy/hugo.init.1()\r\n\t/go/src/github.com/filebrowser/caddy/hugo/rice-box.go:221 +0x224b\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, last, I tried adding the rice-box to `filebrowser/caddy/parser`: \r\n[fb_caddy_all_parser.sh.txt](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/files/2258803/fb_caddy_all_parser.sh.txt). It is properly compiled and there is no error at runtime. I think that we should go with this solution. Do you agree?\r\n Just a note to remember enabling `gosec` with excluded options (those related to using MD5):\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/securego/gosec#selecting-rules\r\n- https://github.com/securego/gosec/issues/148#issuecomment-355534317\r\n\r\nNeed to check how to provide options in `.gometalinter.json`. @hacdias branch `develop` in this repo is a single commit ahead of branch `master` in my fork. So, it is/was meant for that. Anyway, I will:\r\n\r\n- Apply the commit on top of `chore/build`.\r\n- Remove `develop` and `master` from my fork.\r\n- Push branch `img-dev` from my fork to here as `chore/devenv`.\r\n\r\nThen, I will follow with encrypting the credentials of the bot, and have Travis properly set up.  i try to run filebrowser in LEDE X86-64,it showed ash not found,what's problem?\r\n\r\nthe path is correct and chmod +x\r\nfilebrowser is downloaded from linux-amd64-filebrowser.tar.gz  Fix #309.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves `\"--config\", \"/config.json\"` in the Dockerfile from CMD to ENTRYPOINT, in order to prevent these arguments being overriden.\r\n\r\nNote that right now Viper does not support multiple config files:\r\n\r\n> https://github.com/spf13/viper#reading-config-files\r\n> Viper can search multiple paths, but currently a single Viper instance only supports a single configuration file.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if a user provides an additional `-c` flag, parameters in `.config.json` are completely ignored. Only the last passed config file will be used.\r\n\r\nSomething like spf13/viper#442 would be really useful in this use case.  ### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com?

Won't it be 0755 or 0700? Also in the file resource.go, there are two '0776' permissions for files.  Won't it be 0644 or 0600? Since I'm not an avid unix user, I'm unsure what the default permissions should be. This can be easily changed though. @1138-4EB thoughts? #300? @Equim-chan related issues, yes!

How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\n  I'm trying to add support for Filebrowser to my one-click-install hosting platform.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would love some way to change the password before the first login so that I can install and configure the application for my end-user without having to give everybody the admin/admin details. (they might be lazy and not change it leading to security issues).\r\n\r\nWould you be open to accepting a PR that implements some form of setting the initial password via a config or command line option? Is there a better way you can think of to do this?  For a further goal, I think a full featured HTTP API can be implemented to help. I also vote for this issue. The current solution with a default admin/admin user makes automated deployments impossible or unsafe. There is always a manual step required.\r\n\r\nI am deploying with Docker in Kubernetes and it's common to specify such information in a secret, which is then used to populate environment variables for the container. Now that #360 is in master I can vote for this also :-). I was also interested in a one-click-install, in my case for rancher, but without admin password config option is not a good fit for public usage. Indeed, with #506 we removed possible inconsistencies between the config file, flags and envvars. Also a placeholder for database related CLI (sub)commands was added.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is relatively straightforward to add default `user` and `password` fields to the config file, flags and envvars at the same time. The user is not a problem, but as commented by @hacdias in [371-issuecomment-370157182](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/371#issuecomment-370157182) it is not desirable at all to store passwords in plain text.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe might add several subcommands to `filebrowser db`:\r\n\r\n- `filebrowser db init` would initialize a db file (i.e. execute func `Setup`) without starting the server (i.e. do not execute func `http.Serve`).\r\n- `filebrowser db set pass <user>` could prompt for a password (twice) and update the database. \r\n- `filebrowser db hash` would take a string and execute `HashPassword`. Then, the user would use the hash in the config/flag/envvar when executing `filebrowser serve`. However, I don't know if this is secure enough.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMoreover, a very demanded feature is to allow programmatically adding/removing/editing user entries in the database. A possible approach is to use a YAML file to define users and groups. E.g.:\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\n- &g-admin\r\n  scope: \"/srv\"\r\n  allowCommands: true\r\n  commands:\r\n    - git\r\n    - svn\r\n    - wget\r\n- <<: *g-admin\r\n  name: admin\r\n  passwd: <hash>\r\n- <<: *g-admin\r\n  name: otheradmin\r\n  passwd: <hash>\r\n- &g-agroup\r\n  allowCommands: true\r\n  commands:\r\n    - ls\r\n- <<: *g-agroup\r\n  name: auser\r\n  passwd: <hash>\r\n  scope: \"/srv/auser\"\r\n- <<: *g-agroup\r\n  name: anotheruser\r\n  passwd: <hash>\r\n  scope: \"/srv/anotheruser\"\r\n- name: otheruser\r\n  passwd: <hash>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this context, a single flag/envvar/config field would be required, which would point to the yaml file. Note that the admin or admins would be just entries in this file. Furthermore, the file could be automatically edited/removed by the backend after the content is used to init/sync the database. Also, this file would be provided to either `filebrowser serve`, `filebrowser db init` or to both of them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, equivalent JSON or TOML versions of the YAML can be supported, although I think that those formats are much more verbose in this context.\r\n\r\nBut, I don't know how this scheme fits with Docker and Kubernetes secrets, as commented by @Jens-vd. Maybe `--admin.user` and `--admin.pass` can be optional flags for `filebrowser db init` only? For the use case of one click installers simple docker deployment having a `--admin.pass` / `FB_ADMIN_PASS` would be enough. Ideally upon start up of the service the provided `admin.pass` should be used to initialize/override the admin user password and storing it as however is preferred. But it should be provided as clear text from a configuration perspective.\r\n\r\nThis is similar as how pg or mysql docker images allow root password to be setup.\r\n\r\nOnce an admin password is known users can be added from UI, from a simple docker deployment process that is enough in my experience.\r\n\r\nCurrently, admin already has a default password, changing where that that value comes from with the current architecture of users/password would allow one-click-install to move forward without the whole discussion of where to store them.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't mind if the `admin.user` is fixed to admin. Letting it be fixed simplify how to deal with overwriting existing installation admin password.

What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n\r\nUpload can only select file\r\n  Currently, filebrowser is run as root (at least for the docker version) and every file created through filebrowser is hence created as root too.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to link filebrowser users with systems users and permissions. \r\nFor example if I have multiple users who create multiple files through filebrowser, I would like each filebrowser users to be mapped with the different system users.\r\nFor example through an option we could activate when running filebrowser (--map-users or --unix-perms ...)\r\n\r\nAnyway I think that would be more secure to use Unix permissions under the hood rather than the \"everything belongs to the same user\" model...\r\n\r\nWould that be possible ? Would that need a lot of modifications in the code ?\r\nI would love to contribute to the project and make that possible but Go is not really my thing :(\r\n\r\nAnd if you don't have time for that, maybe you could tell me where I should start to look in your code to do that ? I'm having a same problem, too. I linked filebrowser running on my docker to a storage where I also connected to a samba server, and when I create a file or folder through filebrowser, the owner of file is set to root so I cannot access from a samba client.\r\nIn case of [linuxserver/transmission](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/transmission/), it lets you set uid/gid directly via environments. Maybe filebrowser can do the same, I guess?\r\nIt would be nice if admin can set permissions of different uid/gid for each users, but it can wait.\r\nBy the way, this project is so cool. I'd really love to use it if this issue is fixed. I second this. The FS I'm mounting to upload/download/edit is never owned by root:root. The `--user` flag works fine for me. Thanks!  Hi,\r\nI'm trying to use filebrowser with an nginx-proxy frontend. Evrything dockerized.\r\nThe nginx-proxy is the [jwilder's nginx-proxy container](https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/) .\r\n\r\nUsually the nginx-proxy is quite intelligent and only needs the backend container to run a webserver (apache, nginx, caddy or whatever) with the VIRTUAL_HOST environment variable defined, to be able to automatically redirect the user to the right container according to its VIRTUAL_HOST.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I get in my web browser is \"connexion failed\" when I try to load files.mydoma.in. \r\nWhereas running filebrowser (docker) with port forwarding on the host works fine !! But I don't want to expose a port on the internet, I want filebrowser beeing accessible through a vhost :(\r\n\r\nEDIT: I succeed to access the filebrowser container through nginx, but now I'm stuck with a page which keeps loading\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my docker-compose file:\r\n```\r\n\r\nversion: '2'\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx-proxy:\r\n    image: jwilder/nginx-proxy\r\n    container_name: nginx-proxy\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - '/mnt2/root/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro'\r\n      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro'\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 443:443\r\n    networks:\r\n      - web\r\n  filebrowser:\r\n    image: hacdias/filebrowser\r\n    container_name: filebrowser\r\n    hostname: filebrowser\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 8080:80\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /mnt2/data:/srv\r\n      - /root/dockerstuff/filebrowser/config.json:/config.json\r\n    environment:\r\n      - VIRTUAL_HOST=files.mydoma.in\r\n    networks:\r\n      - web\r\nnetworks:\r\n  web:\r\n    driver: bridge\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is my config.json:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"port\": 80,\r\n  \"address\": \"0.0.0.0\",\r\n  \"baseURL\": \"/files\",\r\n  \"database\": \"/etc/database.db\",\r\n  \"scope\": \"/srv\",\r\n  \"log\": \"stdout\",\r\n  \"allowCommands\": true,\r\n  \"allowEdit\": true,\r\n  \"allowNew\": true,\r\n  \"commands\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI really don't understand why this configuration does not work, so maybe you could give me some clues ?

with\r\n- The configuration stored in the database\r\n\r\nHaving a single \"entry point\" to configure filebrowser would be handier. ### Using only one variable file\r\n> Having a single \"entry point\" to configure filebrowser would be handier.\r\n\r\nThe db file is more than just configs (as hacdias mentioned, the share links don't belong to config). I don't really agree that we should merge the db into config file or vice versa. Plus, config file is not always writable (e.g. when used in Caddy as a plugin).\r\n\r\n### Using two (current status) but they can be merged\r\nThough I don't really agree that db should be handled by the user by hand, we can still make an extra feature to dump/merge the db. \r\n\r\n> Multiple processes trying to edit the file\r\n\r\nThe instance locks the db file, so it's unlikely that we can achieve writing online from external side. If we need to do that online, this feature should be embed in the application itself.\r\n\r\n> If the user wanted to set the password via the config file they would need to encrypt it with the right algorithm (we won't store them in plain text!)\r\n\r\nIt's not allowed by design. Force overriding the password is a fault responsible to the user.\r\n\r\n> Where would we put the share links?\r\n\r\nSame as above.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe current design of the config file is a bit confusing. Basically like `--allow-commands`, they are meant for the default value for new users but the words doesn't really tell and it looks like it applies globally. Hello @hacdias / @Equim-chan!\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about this and I may have found a solution.\r\nThe idea would be to drop the configuration file and keep the database only.\r\n\r\nWhen Filebrowser would start for the first time, you could interactively prompt the administrator to enter the different \"key\" parameters (baseURL, port, address...) via:\r\n- The command line (after typing \"filebrowser --config\" for instance)\r\n- Directly via the web interface (in that case, you would use a port by default on which the user could directly connect and set it up)\r\n\r\nThat way, the general configuration would also be in the database and any modification would be done directly via the interface.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not sure that is the best idea :stuck_out_tongue: Just dropping my two cents here as I see things from a different perspective, one you might want to ignore but I wanted to give it regardless \ud83d\ude1b\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking to do unattended installations of Filebrowser for my users. They simply click \"Install app\" and select \"Filebrowser\". They pick a password and that should it be for them. Having passwords in the database for me would be a bit annoying since my software would need to write to the boltdb database to get the password in as I can't (or rather prefer not to need any) have any console input. \r\n\r\nPerhaps users could be bootstrapped from the config file?\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nbootstrap:\r\n  users:\r\n    admin:\r\n      password: sha1#707e663f6af05f7cce3fa9c8009e3817f991c821\r\n      scope: /path/to/my/files\r\n      allowCommands: true\r\n      allowEdit: true\r\n      allowNew: true\r\n      commands:\r\n        - git\r\n        - svn\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf on boot the bootstrap config is detected it imports this data into the database and removes it from the config file. Perhaps have some limitation as to when a bootstrap config will be imported for added security.\r\n   > When Filebrowser would start for the first time, you could interactively prompt the administrator to enter the different \"key\" parameters (baseURL, port, address...)\r\n\r\nI think it's a good idea, pretty similar to the installation of MediaWiki, PHPBB, Jenkins, gogs, etc..\r\n\r\nWe can make an import/export feature that helps batch works.  I found that if there are symbolic links(ln -s) in the directory and enter into the directory, then the filebrowser will show \"Something really went wrong.\"\r\n\r\nmy command is below:\r\n/u02/test-agent/agent/filebrowser --no-auth --port 32032 --database /u02/test-agent/agent/filebrowser.db --scope / --commands \"ls cd\"\r\nAs result, I can see the root content / ,but can`t see anything in /var, but report \"Something really went wrong.\", and the background say:\r\n2018/02/25 20:29:48 /var/: 410 Gone\r\n2018/02/25 20:29:48 stat lock: no such file or directory\"\r\n\r\nhow to handle it?  Nice, let's go for it. Thanks \ud83d\ude04  ping @hacdias, I think it's ready to release a new version now.  Thanks for this @Equim-chan \ud83d\ude04 This is awesome eheh @Equim-chan I know I've just merged this, but I'd like to ask you to change the option 'alternative_recaptcha' to 'recaptcha_host' so it is more direct. And do the same on https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser.github.io/pull/2 \ud83d\ude3a \r\n Oh okay. I thought there would be more alternatives  A useful feature would be being able to see a progress bar for file copy and possibly a speed indicator.\r\nThis is helpful when using a slow disk or FUSE mount.  my command is below:\r\n/u02/test-agent/agent/filebrowser --no-auth --port 32032 --database /u02/test-agent/agent/filebrowser.db --scope / --commands \"ls cd\"\r\nAs result, I can see the root content / ,but can`t see anything in /var, but report \"Something really went wrong.\", and the background say:\r\n  2018/02/25 20:29:48 /var/: 410 Gone \r\n  2018/02/25 20:29:48 stat lock: no such file or directory\" I log into the linux with root and  run filebrowser, so I think filebrowser has the root permission. And I run the command: ls -al\r\ndrwxr-xr-x.  21 root root  4096 Feb 25 20:18 var yes, I got a result: \r\nif there are symbolic links(ln -s) in the directory and enter into the directory, then the filebrowser will show \"Something really went wrong.\" hi  Equim-chan , is there a document to show how to compile the filebrowser. I had compiled the filebrowser but run to got some error below:\r\n./example: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'\r\n./example: line 1: `!<arch>'\r\n Thank you very much for the suggestion\uff0cand I have another question that why the binary I compiled is much bigger than the binary from yours, I have used  \"go build\" with the parameter -ldflags \"-s -w\"?  Thanks @Equim-chan \ud83d\ude04   It is possible download a file via wget command passing user and password as argument?\r\n\r\nFor example, I want to download a file named \"myfile.zip\", placed in root. I would like to execute the following command to download the file via command line: \r\nwget --use=MYUSER --password=MYPASSWORD http://mydomain.com/api/myfile.zip.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nAS @Equim-chan \r\nSeems related to 2 things.\r\n1.authorization\r\n2.path @la0wei Path is `/api/download/{related file path to scope}`. For example, with scope `/srv`, to download a file `/srv/test/100M.bin`, GET `/api/download/test/100M.bin`.  \r\n### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com?

I am also running it behind a Nginx reverse proxy, again this should not cause issues. @joshk132 could please provide some more info so that we can reproduce the behaviour?  \u95ee\u4e0b\u8fd9\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e48\uff1f  **Name:** Cloudify\r\n**Slug:** cloudify **Name:** Firefly\r\n**Slug:** firefly\r\n\r\n_Firefly, the decentralized file browser._ **Name:** filebrowser\r\n**Slug:** filebrowser IMHO it'd be interesting to add \"web\" somewhere, since the main feature of the project is that it is a web-based file manager/browser: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager\r\n\r\n**Name**: Web File Manager\r\n**slug**: wfm\r\n\r\nRelated to #342, possible repos:\r\n\r\n- wfm/front-vue\r\n- wfm/front-angularjs\r\n- wfm/back-go\r\n- wfm/back-ipfs\r\n\r\n[wfm](https://github.com/wfm) is not available ATM, but it seems to be a profile with very very little public activity. Shall you like the proposal, it might be worth mentioning him to politely ask if he would change his name to wfmurphy or any other, so that the organization can be created. If contacting him is not possible, GitHub staff can check it according to https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy/\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'd just propose **web-file-manager**. @malikpiara the name [firefly](https://github.com/firefly) and [cloudify](https://github.com/cloudify) are already occupied. @Equim-chan yeah, it's 7am here and I'm going to catch a train, but I will start the process of moving today hopefully. Although I won't be in Portugal in the next couple of days so I'm not sure if I can finish this.\r\n\r\nWe also have to define how are we going to split everything because this is not *that* simple as just moving a repository. Yes, initially, and I can do that just now, we will be moving a repository. Although, the goal is to split the front-end from the back-end and even split it in some more packages \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nI'll get back to this later today \ud83d\ude04 \r\n  Wow! I was _just_ about to propose this!! Yeah just now when I opened the issue page! :smile:\r\n\r\nI'm making more changes at the moment, but I can hold on until the organisation is possibly established.\r\n\r\nThere will be a few things to do if an organisation is to be established:\r\n* [ ] Change import paths in Go source files\r\n* [ ] Update documents for all `go get` cases\r\n* [ ] Migrate the project's main page to its new home\r\n* [ ] Re-submit Caddy plugin Most of my changes are trivial, so I don't prefer them to be in one single PR, nor merged into one single commit. So I think I'd wait. I'm also thinking of it at the moment... If we adopt a good organisation name, do we need to change the project title as well? * **file-manager**? _simply adding a bar_\r\n* **filemand**? _file manager daemon, sounds classic_\r\n* **easyfile**? _clear but not somewhat off-topic_\r\n* **efile**? _short but not clear_\r\n* **teamfile**? _a bit random_\r\n* **fileer**? _almost meaningless, but short_\r\n* **filebrowser**? _this matches the original name more_\r\n* **gophiles**? _gopher and files, I like it_\r\n* **gophila**? _a more proper name for an organisation, go with phila (love)_\r\n* **gofile**? _neat and clear name too_\r\n\r\nI'm not really good at giving names though. :smile: I vote for filebrowser  Done @Equim-chan! I'm closing this issue  In the current version, archives are handled by GET, which makes it unable to pass multiple files that have long filenames combined together, since there's a limit for the length of URL.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/30efa23a8567771b089e835ee7d153ebabc577a1/http/download.go#L26\r\n\r\nA possible fix can be done by changing the API to PUT/POST. How do you think? You're welcome! It's exactly because this tool is so cool that I just want to make it cooler. :smile:  Sorry it was my mistake.\r\n\r\nFor example `file+name with space` should be escaped into `file+name%20with%20space` (PathEscape) instead of `file%2Bname+with+space` (QueryEscape), which causes wrong unescaped filename.  `build.sh` was using CRLF for line wrap, making it not gonna be working under Linux. So I ran `dos2unix` on it to change it into LF.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/93566aceef7fa68b7a5009257448716c643f3c0b/http/auth.go#L40-L45\r\nIt can just be\r\n```go\r\nvar data struct {\r\n\tSuccess     bool        `json:\"success\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\nother fields aren't necessary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/93566aceef7fa68b7a5009257448716c643f3c0b/http/http.go#L225-L233\r\nRender with `ReCaptchaSecret`!? Are you serious? Isn't it \"secret\"? :smile:\r\n  Hello, I plan to add an additional captcha feature based on [coinhive](https://coinhive.com/documentation/captcha). This is not meant to replace reCaptcha but provide another choice.\r\n\r\nIt should work like reCaptcha, and can be an alternative for reCaptcha. (reCaptcha is blocked in my country.)\r\n\r\nHowever, since coinhive is a bit controversial so I'd like to ask for your opinion on it. Yes, that's way it works. Okay.  Allow line wrap.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17795845/35197495-e2df97fc-ff1a-11e7-9270-9787c82ba0f2.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17795845/35197497-e7df8262-ff1a-11e7-87ca-e5200843f9b9.png)\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20106653/35141715-e501bc4e-fd36-11e7-9792-4076c39683ba.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20106653/35141725-ec490a3e-fd36-11e7-83b8-f54d7e5ea1e2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor mobile support I have the same problem.\r\nThis is my android browser\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UCMobile.intl I can't reproduce this under Chrome for Android 63.0.3239.111. Maybe it's just fine to update your browser?  `X-Content-Type` should be `X-Content-Type-Options`\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options  JWT itself already utilized the `Authorization` header, therefore it is redundant to set it again in the `Cookie` header, not to mention JWT token itself is quite long (see the figure). It's also [not secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) to use cookie in such manner.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17795845/34925172-9ad45688-f9e2-11e7-881c-77e0aebe0b18.png)\r\n\r\nA better place to store the token in frontend is window.localStorage. Although local storage doesn't have the expiration feature like cookie, it can be implemented by storing an `expire` field and checking that manually on load. Sure, but I may try that after I finish my exams, just a few days to go. https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/1f946bd94e807679575812206e62425905434036/http/auth.go#L120-L133\r\n\r\nCan we just put the `ID` field to the token and drop other fields of `u` here? Since when the token is validated we only used the `ID` to retrieve.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/1f946bd94e807679575812206e62425905434036/http/auth.go#L192\r\n\r\nNow I just wonder if the frontend has used the token to retrieve user data. (I'm not familiar with the frontend code) Well, that's a bit of an anti-pattern though, since tokens are meant to be used for authorization only.  Currently the hash of share link is 32 bytes long and 64 characters long in hex. It's not really necessary to use a hash that long, even 16 bytes is enough. Or, adopt Base64 encoding instead of hex?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/94648c92a2d159d8edebb06adb9cd7462aa4374c/http/share.go#L70-L75  The main benefit of [http.ServeContent](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeContent)  over io.Copy is that it handles Range requests properly, sets the MIME type, and handles If-Match, If-Unmodified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since, and If-Range requests. This is helpful when downloading under an unstable network condition where a download connection may be cut off. With http.ServeContent, suspended downloading process can be resumed properly.\r\n\r\n[http.ServeFile](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeFile) is just a wrapper over http.ServeContent which handles path resolve.\r\n\r\nIn downloadHandler, it's a bit hard to adopt http.ServeContent, but at the moment it's not necessary to store the archived filed in the first place; it's an overhead that we can reduce.\r\n\r\nNOTE: try to reproduce #303 to make sure the stream is properly adopted.   By the way, I'm improving the download handler at the moment. Another PR may drop soon. Haha, actually that fix is exactly what makes a new problem.  \r\nI am trying to upload a .iso file to my file server using filemanager.mydomain.com but it gives me a red info box in the bottom right that says 413 error request too large. I have tried accessing it locally but no luck with that either. Rebooted the host system and filemanager. Cleared cache, use incog chrome, check for more error messages (none found).\r\n\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nUpload file over 100MB I am not sure which ones to check.. \r\n\r\nI am running Ubuntu Server 16.04, nginx for web server and webmin so far. I am uploading to a raid 1 made using mdadm. Locally it works fine now (rebooted filemanager) but remote is still giving the `413` error.  Is your server behind Cloudflare? Cloudflare has a maximum upload size limit. No not behind anything, it is a local file server that I wanted web based access to remotely. What is your nginx config? ```\r\nhttp\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n        server_names_hash_bucket_size 512;\r\n        client_header_buffer_size 32k;\r\n        large_client_header_buffers 4 32k;\r\n        client_max_body_size 10g;\r\n     ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've the same problem, but I changed my nginx like this, now everything is OK\r\n@joshk132  i have this problem using the docker image. is there no way to configure the container from the json file to increase the setting?  ### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nI am trying to access my files remotely with filemanager using `filemanager.mydomain.com` but it will not work yet it will show the files for `192.168.0.111:80880`\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nMy files were to show up both locally and using a remote connection.\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nI can see my files locally (using internal IP) but not when I use `filemanager.mydomain.com`\r\nI see the error message `Something really went wrong.` using `filemanager.mydomain.com`\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nNot sure, I have installed this before with no issues using domains but it seems something went wrong this time. I have reinstalled and changed my Nginx files with no luck\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\nI can tell the two are linked since account and CSS changes affect both local and domain mapped. I solved it by removing and reinstalling it a few times then rebooting nginx. Either the last install fixed it or the third reboot of nginx solved it.   https://github.com/welloo6/filemanager\r\n\r\nIt's not created using `Fork`\r\n\r\nJust FYI. May not be an issue, seems that the guy just likes to mirror all the things.  To begin, thank you for this tool, it is very nice to use !\r\n\r\nI noticed a problem. We have a folder with 9000 files (yes I know...). When trying to access the folder, we have 2 behaviours:\r\n- If the computer is a little old (white Macbook for example): cpu increase + not complete display.\r\n- If more powerful computer: display with scrolling.\r\n\r\nBut in both cases, if you upload a file, it doesn't appear at the top of the list, as if the sort doesn't work.\r\n\r\nCould we stop the Infinite scrolling after 500 or 1000 files? and after display in blocks of 500.  could u add a option to show or hide the hidden files and folders?\r\nnow it show all the hidden things in default.\r\n thanks~~^_^ disallow regex \\\\/\\\\..+\r\n\r\nthe example you gave in setting seems unvaild.\r\nit didn't change anything when i setted. sloved\uff01thank you very much! ^_^ Hi there! awesome work with filemanager, thanks!!! I just ran into this, but I'm not using auth, so there is no user settings section AFAIS... is there a way to hide dotfiles in this case? Thanks! Currently, you can't do that without using auth. Could you open an issue for that? @hacdias Done! https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/349 Cheers.  I found that Caddy plugin version is still stuck in the v1.3.12 version, there are some BUG (For example, IDM download can not get the file size, does not support resume from break-point) will affect the use, hope to be able to update to the latest version!\r\nThank you~\r\n    i want to build filemanager using go sdk myself, my platform is armv7l with go 1.9, can you tell me what librarys it depends so that i could using 'go get xxx' command to install them. tks  Any suggestion on slimming everything down for a 15 inch display the default is okay for bigger displays but for a 15inch laptop display it looks ugly  it's not an issue I just think that the interface would look better if everything were a little smaller\r\nI was looking if it can be done with custom css\r\n<img width=\"532\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-01 at 8 52 30 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995878/34470261-8c3b6a8c-ef36-11e7-9c54-98c93e6f2923.png\">\r\n  i run filemanager 1.4 in my router and showed error \"somthing may goes wrong\" in my files.\r\nhow to slove it?\r\n\r\ncommand line showed message below\r\n\r\n[RT-N56U_B1 /media/AiCard_01/filemanager]# ./filemanager -p 888 -s /tmp\r\nListening on [::]:888\r\n2017/12/31 07:58:25 /auth/renew: 403 Forbidden\r\n2017/12/31 07:58:25 /auth/renew: 403 Forbidden sloved,thanks.\r\n\r\nbut it doesn't work when i try to hidden the hidden files.\r\ndisallow regex \\\\/\\\\..+ Hello, what's the state of this?

What are you trying to do?\r\nDownload a 1.66 GB file which was uploaded successfully.\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nOnce the file is selected and the download button is pressed, I'd expected to see a \"Save file\" kind of a pop-up.\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nAfter selecting the file and pressing the download button, another page started loading and after a few seconds it stopped loading. Caddy was no longer running on the VPS it was running on previously and had to be restarted. Nothing was logged. The VPS has 512 MB RAM only, so the file doesn't fit in it -- maybe that caused the problem?\r\n\r\nTo me, it doesn't seem like a timeout issue, as I wouldn't expect Caddy to crash after timing out.\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\n1. Upload a big file (potentially bigger than RAM available).\r\n2. Try downloading the big file. Thanks for the quick action!\r\n\r\nI downloaded and (re)installed Caddy with `curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal http.cache,http.filemanager,http.forwardproxy,http.git,http.minify`.\r\n\r\nIs that correct? Can I validate running the correct version of Filemanager?\r\n\r\nThe problem persists and indeed, `htop` shows memory usage climbing to 800+ MB and staying there for a while (swapping) before Caddy is killed.\r\n\r\n[The source code](https://golang.org/src/io/io.go?s=13259:13340#L378) of `io.Copy` (`io.copyBuffer`) first tries using `WriteTo` or `ReadFrom`, before falling back to a 32K buffer. Could it be that `WriteTo` or `ReadFrom` are unbuffered?\r\n\r\nTake my Go knowledge with a big grain of salt. Disabling Minify helped!\r\n\r\nHad no idea it tried to minify downloads as well.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!  @hacdias, first of all I'd like to congratulate you. This is a very interesting piece of software.\r\n\r\nIndeed, some months ago I was about to write a file explorer with a vue.js frontend and a golang backend, in order to make it easier to tinker in play-with-docker, and I found your project. Had a quick look and left it to be checked later. The next time, I thought about adding codemirror to enhance the editor, but I didn't start with it because I thought I had to dive into the codebase. Today I had a longer try with it and I am really pleased to know that it is already included. Awesome!\r\n\r\nHowever, I found some issues. I'll put some of them here, and I'll split those you 'accept' to separate issues:\r\n\r\n- Already merged/closed/solved: #309, #310, #311, #312.\r\n- To be tested: #314.\r\n- Open: filebrowser/frontend#55.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Tabs\r\n\r\nProposed in #240 for commands. However, I mean it for the main view in the explorer. I.e., keep a common header and sidebar and have multiple main views. I think there is enough space in the header to put the controls corresponding to the tabs, where the active one is marked and it can be changed.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I think that tabs should be agnostic to the content, so that three possible contents are shown in each tab:\r\n\r\n- Folder, file explorer.\r\n- Editor.\r\n- Command output.\r\n\r\n# xterm.js\r\n\r\nRelated to #240, the `command` functionality can be removed from the search box and handled on its own. I think that an interesting approach would be to use [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), which is almost as straigthforward as codemirror. Actually, when I proposed the tabs above, I was thinking that the 'Command output' tab type would be, in fact, an `xterm.js` terminal. E.g. xtermjs/xterm.js#573 (note the tabs).\r\n\r\nHowever, on the one hand the image should be reverted to alpine, in order to have a shell available. On the other hand, I don't know how much flexibility you want to let the users have. If you are ok with them being quite free inside the container, I think that integrating xterm is seamless. If not, I am not sure of which steps would be required to limit the functionality.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of xterm.js is changing to full screen with `Alt+Return`. Thus, if used, the quick access list suggested above would need to use a different shortcut.\r\n\r\n# Tiling\r\n\r\nIf tiling is added, such as https://l0rn.github.io/vue-tile-panels/, I think I might drop Atom and use filemanager instead :D (maybe renamed to fileeditor/lightweight-ide XD).\r\n\r\nNote that this tiling can be an addition to each tab. That is, inside each tab you can have:\r\n\r\n- Folder, file explorer.\r\n- Editor.\r\n- Terminal.\r\n- Tile container.\r\n\r\nThen, each block in the tile container can take any of the above, ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nLast, replicating the `Alt+Return` functionality, any container at any level would be allowed to be shown in full page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about these proposals. Do you find it interesting to push filemanager to this path or do you prefer to keep it more lightweight from the library dependencies point of view? I split the first six bugs/enhancement proposals to separate issues, in order to track them better. I think we agree that all of them fit in the scope of this project.\r\n\r\nHowever, I stopped with Tabs, xterm.js and Tiling. As you point out, having all of these combined might be out of the scope of this project. Therefore, I'll like to discuss whether it'd be possible to have two main variants selectable at build time. The 'lightweight' one with a single tab, no tiling and no terminal. The 'full featured' with all of them enabled.\r\n\r\nIndeed, related to the option proposed in #310, I think it'd be interesting to have a list of checkboxes to select which features to build. Note that I am not expecting you to actually implement all of these features. Nor do I want to push you to accept any. Yet, I'd like to know how close/far do you think the codebase is from allowing such an approach.\r\n\r\n> If someone wants to have full access to a server, they can use SSH.\r\n\r\nThe main objective is not to have full access to a server, but to i) have colorized output and ii) execute interactive (not batch) commands. I am not thinking about running it natively, but inside a container.\r\n\r\nSee #315 where I explain a use cases that would benefit from minimal interactivity. Note that for this specific use case a single button that kills the process would suffice. No need for xterm.js at all.\r\n\r\nWhy do I want to execute filemanager or any other app inside the container? Because, how do I test the binary out of the container? I can use `docker cp` or the frontend to take it out of the container. Yet, my host must have all the runtime dependencies, and it might be a different os (say Windows or macOS). Therefore, I might need to crosscompile. In this context, the docker container does not help much. Hence, the proposed \"inception\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think that adding SSH makes filemanager's user and access control redundant and introduces a possible source of conflict. Users are required to handle two separate credentials in order to use the same service.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this is directly related to the `cmd:` label I proposed in #312. Allowing arbitrary values, either absolute or relative, makes filemanager behave as some kind of SSH. However, it is difficult to filter allowed and not allowed resources.\r\n\r\nNote that I am ok with removing access control from filemanager when used in a container (`--no-auth` is used in the example above), and letting admins know that they should use an additional layer. Indeed, in container mode I think that the most 'elegant' approach would be:\r\n\r\n- Split user access and database handlers to a 'entrypoint' package.\r\n- Have a single or a set of alpine-based containers (lightweight, full-featured, custom).\r\n- Let admins create derived images:\r\n  - Create system users with fine-grained access control.\r\n  - Add complementary tools/dependencies.\r\n- Make the filemanager entrypoint support 2-3 types of setups for each user:\r\n  - Single directory access with a highly filtered command list in a shared container (equivalent to the current behaviour).\r\n  - Access to a shared or exclusive container with the privileges of a user which is already defined in the image (might or might not be root). Note that in this case filemanager can retrieve credentials from the images, so the login of a user can be just forwarded.\r\n\r\nOnce again I'd like to know how close/far is the architecture of the program from allowing such a scheme. Of course, the first approach would be minor refactorization in order to support a single image and only a shared container with a highly filtered command list. Indeed, I think that any further additions should be developed as a wrapper around filemanager, so that filemanager itself does not change much from the features and UX point of view. In the end this is an enhancement to the UAC, not to the program itself.  Hi,\r\n\r\nfirst of all, great app.\r\n\r\nBut as always there is a \"but\". I need to create directories but the group \"other\" haven't the \"execution\" permission. Can it be modified in the configuration, or edited in the permission of a directory/file? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nBrian The permissions of the newly created directory (test) in filemanager is 754 (drwxr-xr--). As a result, we can not run cd test user other than root in terminal (Permission denied).\r\nWe need to have permissions 755 (drwxr-xr-x) after the directory creation.\r\n +1 Same problem here Yes, I'm sure.\r\nI launch it in Docker. Me too. Issue on docker too @Equim-chan thanks for searching about that. What about setting `umask` with 0755? My question about `os.Chmod` is that if you don't have access to the file due to the permissions, how can you change them? Yeah, I think you're right. Go for it then. Create a new branch and open a PR with a fix \ud83d\ude04  Let's start by trying using chmod to make sure it works. If not, we can then change to umask. It would also be nice to have a way to view and set permissions in the UI. Hi @hacdias, \u0430re there any updates on this issue?\r\nThank you very much for your work!\r\n Same issue on Centos. \r\nAny workflow for this? Same issue on Debian. I'm on Debian and when I create files (ie: *.txt) the permissions are set to 755.  I have \"other\" group and rest of files set to 0700 since running filebrowser as user filebrowser, but files and folders still 755 when created through interface.  Would like files 644 or 640 for that matter instead.  Does it support https?\r\nHow to config?  Hi All, \r\n\r\nI would like to ask, is there any way to mount network disk? In the window system to do, I tried for a long time:( \r\n\r\nVery thanks all Hi hacdias,\r\n\r\nVery thanks your respond, it's work, Does not meet the practical application method :(\r\n  I want to see the contend of the dir \"/home/transmission/Downloads\", So I run like this:\r\nfilemanager -c /etc/filemanager.json -s /home/transmission/Downloads\r\nBut filemanager show me the conten of root directory.\r\nI have no idea and have to ask any help. thanks.\r\n thanks\uff0cit works.  Hi, question...  I add a command like \"grep\" on a new user and execute like a grep <word> *.sh with no return, any help?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n Definitely related, I get the following record when I try to execute a command\r\n\r\n`2017/12/12 11:22:40 websocket: the client is not using the websocket protocol: 'upgrade' token not found in 'Connection' header`\r\n\r\nThis is the scenario, I have a server in an intranet and I access remote with other users, look for related information but I can not find it. :( Yest, hope help\r\n\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6908410/33891596-26818e80-df35-11e7-8734-111e6d701912.png)\r\n Sorry for that.... my bad!\r\n\r\nSo with no proxy I can execute a grep for any file with no errors\r\n\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6908410/33891915-2871814a-df36-11e7-9e8a-e329e4641e53.png)\r\n\r\nBut I can't use a wildcard for the command\r\n\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6908410/33891948-3d1f8baa-df36-11e7-977f-042319460523.png)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n yes, now I not using any proxy.\r\n\r\nI start the service (no websocket message)\r\n```\r\nroot@fs02:~# filemanager\r\nListening on [::]:43915\r\n```\r\nI copy .bashrc to test.log,  in the terminal execute the command\r\n```\r\n\r\nroot@fs02:~# grep alias *.log\r\n alias ls='ls $LS_OPTIONS'\r\n alias ll='ls $LS_OPTIONS -l'\r\n alias l='ls $LS_OPTIONS -lA'\r\n alias apti='apt-get install -y'\r\n alias aptud='apt-get -y update'\r\n alias aptug='apt-get -y upgrade'\r\n# Some more alias to avoid making mistakes:\r\n alias rm='rm -i'\r\n alias cp='cp -i'\r\n alias mv='mv -i'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the FM the same command\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6908410/33892702-3634734e-df38-11e7-9b10-e96f9bbe1993.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n No problem and thanks for the help!! ;) Closing this in favour of #466 and #486.  Hi,\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see the actual output of a command executed in the search/command field. By having access to this output we could use commands like grep to search through the content of files.\r\n\r\nHaving a more advanced search, that has the ability to use wildcards and search in files would even be better. ;-)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nGeert Are you using the latest version? I see output when I run a command\r\n\r\n![fm-output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4511942/33801358-575cb47c-dd27-11e7-833d-1ddb117304e9.png)\r\n Yes, I am using the latest version running within Docker. I changed the original Dockerfile to use Debian instead of starting from \"scratch\", so all my necessary tools should be available.\r\n\r\nI don't mount a config file but use: `--scope /data --port 80 --baseurl /filemanager --commands grep ls unzip --allow-commands true` as the Docker cmd.\r\n\r\nIf I execute for example the zip command I get:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1923423/33809560-3d1583c8-ddf9-11e7-8b85-0c25e15ceefa.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the same results for the other commands. Executing those commands from the CLI (using docker exec) work as expected... Am I missing something? Ok, played around with the `--commands` param and I now use `--commands 'ls grep unzip'`. Result is different:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1923423/33809644-95508910-ddfa-11e7-9132-9534d67bf468.png)\r\n\r\nBut still no output for all my commands I execute. They look correct:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1923423/33809755-1a7e594a-ddfc-11e7-9a2d-01a0a8c60162.png)\r\n\r\nDid you try from the Docker container (but starting from an OS like e.g Debian that has `ls` available) Ok, I think I found it...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1923423/33809814-279ea6e2-ddfd-11e7-9e16-fdeccc616dab.png)\r\n\r\nTraffic is going via an AWS Load Balancer and an HA Proxy. Probably something misconfigured over there. @hacdias I need to verify this with our ops team tomorrow, probably related to:\r\nhttps://blog.jverkamp.com/2015/07/20/configuring-websockets-behind-an-aws-elb/ Ok, I managed to fix the issue by changing the ELB settings.\r\n\r\nTicket can be closed. Thanks.  I installed filemanager using the docker latest image.\r\nMore an enhancement proposal than an issue but I would like to change the \"admin\" login to another name, but when I try to edit the admin user I am redirected to the \"new user\" form.\r\nMaybe I just did not find the way to do it, but I feel like it is not a good practice to force the admin login to be \"admin\".\r\n You can add a new admin account and delete the \"admin\" account. I tried but there is not button to delete the \"admin\" account, even if I log out of it and log into the \"new\" admin account. Yes, it is exactly the same problem (sorry for creating a new issue), I get redirected to `/users/new` when trying to edit the admin user.\r\nBut I did mount the 3 volumes `(config.json,` `database.db` and `/srv`). My filemanager is runnning in a stack, here is my docker-compose file (without my network and backend rules) if it can help:\r\n```yaml\r\nfilemanager:\r\n    image: hacdias/filemanager:latest\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./data:/srv\r\n      - ./filemanager/config.json:/config.json\r\n      - ./filemanager/database.db:/database.db\r\n```\r\nAlso here is my config.json, which is almost the default one:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n        \"port\": 80,\r\n        \"address\": \"\",\r\n        \"database\": \"/etc/database.db\",\r\n        \"scope\": \"/srv\",\r\n        \"allowCommands\": false,\r\n        \"allowEdit\": true,\r\n        \"allowNew\": true,\r\n        \"commands\": []\r\n} \r\n```                               \r\nI don't really understand how the `database.db` file is supposed to be used though, mine remains empty. Maybe my configuration is wrong somewhere ?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there a way to get an access into the container? The bash executable is not found. (Maybe that's another issue/enhancement). Well, the `database.db` file is not empty now, but I still cannot remove or edit the admin user. Yes FWIW, I'm was having the same issue when trying to edit the `admin` account while logged in as `admin`. \r\nI can however update the password for the account from the `Profile Settings` tab (there is a \"Change password\" card at the very bottom) rather than the `User Management` tab. \r\n\r\n_ps: thanks @hacdias for the neat utility._ I can already update password but I'd like to update the login: I don't want it to be called admin because it makes it easier to bruteforce the account as you already know the login. Not really urgent but I think it could be a security improvement. No problem, as I said this is not urgent. I'll try to check my configuration again, if it's working for you I must have something wrong. Sorry I missed that you wanna change the name. I was unable to change the password for admin from user management due to the same issue and initially didn't see the change password part due to my crappy console resolution. I don't know how to access the dev console within the docker container ? Here is what seems to happen: I start from the user management page, I have 2 users, admin and Bob.\r\n- If I click on Bob's edit button, it loads /auth/renew and then /users/2 and I can edit Bob.\r\n- If I click on admin's edit button, it loads /auth/renew, then /users/1, then /auth/renew again and then /users/base, then I'm on the \"new user\" page.\r\n\r\nI don't see any error though, but I'm not very familiar with web debugging so maybe you'd like more information. Yes, here is a screenshot. There is an error but I don't think it is the cause of my problem (I might be wrong though).\r\nThe red line shows what happens when I click on edit admin.\r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9319997/34559502-5dfa7ba0-f142-11e7-8245-cebf0d1934e0.PNG)\r\n oh.. let me know if I can help Great, no TypeError anymore, and I am finally able to update the admin login!\r\nThanks a lot!  1. version\r\nfilemanager: 1.3.11\r\nubuntu: 16.04.3\r\nchrome: 62\r\n2. filemanager configure\r\n```yaml\r\naddress: 127.0.0.1\r\nbaseURL:\r\nnoAuth: false\r\ndatabase: \"/home/filemanager/filemanager.db\"\r\nlog: \"/home/filemanager/error.log\"\r\nport: 5000\r\nreCaptchaKey: ''\r\nreCaptchaSecret: ''\r\nplugin: ''\r\nscope: \"/home/downloads\"\r\nallowCommands: true\r\nallowEdit: true\r\nallowNew: true\r\ncommands:\r\n        - git\r\n        - ls\r\n```\r\n3.

How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nUse clean GOROOT and package `go` from Arch extra repo. I am totally new to Go, that's why I said \"possible\" (I may be just doing something wrong).  ### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\n\r\nYes.  caddy_v0.10.10_linux_amd64_custom_personal.tar.gz\r\n\r\n### 2. What is your entire Caddyfile?\r\n```text\r\nsitename.co {\r\n\r\n\troot /home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart/public\r\n\thugo /home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart /admin {\r\n\t\tallow_commands      true\r\n\t\tallow_edit          true\r\n\t\tallow_new           true\r\n\t\tallow_publish       true\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\tlog /home/caddy/logs/access-sitename.log\r\n\terrors /home/caddy/logs/errors-sitename.log {\r\n\t\t404 ../keep-calm-404.html\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nI'm using the \"Hugo New\" menu item to create a new post called `NewPost.md`.  Incidentally, if you omit the file extension here File Manager issues a confusing \"Bad Request\" error; took me a while to figure that out.\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expect to see a new file appear in the folder pointed to by \"scope\" which for the user is `/home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart/content/posts`\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nThe file is created in `/home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart/content/home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart/content/posts/MyNewPost.md`\r\n (note the full path to the file is repeated in the folder path created by File Manager)\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nI'm sure I've misconfigured something but I can't figure out what that might be so, other than creating a new user and setting their scope to `<site-root>/content/posts`, I'm not sure \r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, it appears this is basically a bug in Hugo:\r\n```\r\nhugo new -k post `pwd`/posts/TestPost1.md\r\n/home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart/content/home/caddy/www/sitename/quickstart/posts/TestPost1.md created\r\n```\r\nIf given a full path, Hugo should not prepend the current directory to that path (it might have to complain that the path is invalid but that's a separate issue). \r\n\r\nSo my question is: how do I stop File Manager triggering this Hugo bug?  I tried setting the user's scope to just `content/posts` (i.e. a relative path) but File Manager gave an \"Internal Server Error\":\r\n```\r\n2017/11/25 20:33:46 /2: 500 Internal Server Error\r\n2017/11/25 20:33:46 mkdir content/posts: permission denied\r\n```\r\n I'm experiencing the same thing. I believe this has something to do with the hugo plugin itself and the way it manages user scope. If you go in and change the user scope to \"./\" rather than the path to the directory with the hugo site, then using \"hugo new\" creates files in the content directory as you'd expect.  I use filemanger in my router (CPU MTK7621A, OS linux ARCH mips32le) and it works fine,thanks.\r\nthe version in use is complied by others and I want to get the newest version.\r\nI have worked for a week but always failed.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\ncan  the newest version be complied successfully in linux/mips32le? how can I do it? could you give some clues?it seems that GO 1.9.2 has no  mips32le  in GOARCH option, when i use mipsle it also show errors.\r\n i run this command in filemanager floder,nothing error and nothing binary file out.\r\n\r\nwhen i run \r\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle go build -v github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager\r\n\r\nit shows\r\ngithub.com/boltdb/bolt\r\n# github.com/boltdb/bolt\r\n../../boltdb/bolt/db.go:101:13: undefined: maxMapSize \r\n Just tested it in a `golang-alpine` container and it works as expected:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ mkdir tmp-build && cd tmp-build\r\n$ docker run --rm -itv $(pwd):/srv -w /go/src/github.com/filebrowser golang:alpine sh -c \"\\\r\n  apk update && \\\r\n  apk add git && \\\r\n  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/ && \\\r\n  cd filebrowser/cmd/filebrowser && \\\r\n  go get ./... && \\\r\n  GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle go build -v -o /srv/filebrowser\"\r\n$ file filebrowser\r\nfilebrowser: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped\r\n$ cd ..\r\n$ rm -rf tmp-build\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n@ryubaisan, please let us know if it works for you now.  This would be really nice to have. Specifically, TOTP and security keys (FIDO U2F).\r\n\r\nHow I envision it working: \r\n\r\n- Option to _require_ users to set up 2FA when they first log in OR if not enforced, just the option to set it up from their settings page\r\n- Generate a secret using an OTP lib, display the QR code to the user for them to scan it with their phone app, store the key for the user in the DB\r\n- Require the user to enter an OTP code to confirm they have it\r\n- Optionally, once they have OTP set up, they could add a security key as an alternative (e.g. shameless plug: https://bluink.ca/key, or a Yubikey)\r\n- U2F works by storing a key handle, certificate, public key and counter once registered. Most of the hard work is probably dealt with by the lib, but some stuff needs to be done with JS to enable the client-side support. \r\n\r\nLibs you could use:\r\n- https://github.com/pquerna/otp\r\n(I recommend just using TOTP, not HOTP because TOTP is easier to use, but just as secure)\r\n- https://github.com/ryankurte/go-u2f\r\n\r\nI can probably answer any questions you have about it. I use google authenticator for 2 step verification in other web applications. \r\nIs it possible to implement this ??

What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nA loading screen of the filemanager that never stops loading. (I waited 30s locally)\r\n\r\nIt works perfectly in Firefox (latest) and Chrome (latest).\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nUse the Caddyfile above and try to visit the filemanager with IE11 on Windows 7 x64.\r\n\r\n![untitled2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24783458/31875075-8307a5ee-b79a-11e7-85e6-b46a96179fed.png) The same as you by use IE11 . It also Can not be displayed correctly with Chrome .It only works with Firefox. The IE11 Developer Console mentions these:\r\n```\r\nHTML1300: Navigation occurred.\r\nFile: files\r\nSCRIPT5022: [vuex] vuex requires a Promise polyfill in this browser.\r\nFile: vendor.44036de40396f416cb9a.js, Line: 1, Column: 52284\r\n```\r\n\r\n![261-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24783458/31919229-f5480614-b82e-11e7-81c1-0dab7ddfec9f.png)\r\n\r\n![261-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24783458/31919236-f9339c84-b82e-11e7-8345-7b612746938b.png) IE11 is still about 2.5% of users and it seems to affect other browsers a bit. I do have a few users still using this browser.\r\n\r\nCould it be resolved by adding a polyfill like this?\r\nhttps://maketips.net/tip/321/fix-vuex-requires-a-promise-polyfill-in-this-browser\r\n\r\nOr this?\r\nhttps://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise Strange enough that my instance of filebrowser is not fully functioning on Safari (macOS 10.13.2), namely control multi-select. I tried disabling every safari extension with no luck. It works on Chrome though. @hacdias \r\nanyone use the kindle pw3?\r\nit have the same errors like this.\r\ni think because it is not the latest browsers.,..\r\nthe kindle browser even cant suport ftp....\r\nso i search the http file share and find this.\r\nwhat sad~\r\nhope can suport this...\r\n\r\nsorry for my bad english.\r\n\r\n                                                     Best or Best Wishes\r\n @hacdias , if Filebrowser is not meant to support IE (or certain version ranges of it), is it possible to pop up a msg box informing IE users that their browsers are not supported? Thank you and have a nice day! @Platway Good point. I think we may try something like http://outdatedbrowser.com. @Equim-chan , I've just checked out Outdated Browser, and that is amazing! Thank you!  ### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\nCaddy version: Caddy 0.10.10 (non-commercial use only)\r\nHugo version: Hugo Static Site Generator v0.30.2 linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-10-19T07:34:27-04:00\r\n\r\n### 2. What is your entire Caddyfile?\r\n```\r\nnelson.pavlosky.net {\r\n  root /srv/pavlosky.net/nelson/public  # the folder where Hugo generates the website\r\n  hugo /srv/pavlosky.net/nelson /admin # enable the admin panel\r\n  basicauth /admin username password\r\n  expires {\r\n    match .png$ 1y # expires png files after one year\r\n    match .jpg$ 1y # expires jpg files after one year\r\n    match .html$ 5i30s # expires html files after 5 minutes 30 seconds\r\n    match .css  1y # expires css files\r\n  }\r\n  gzip\r\n  errors {\r\n    404 404.html # Not Found\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nI want to log into the Caddy Hugo/filemanager plugin.\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nUpon entering the correct username and password, I should see the filemanager.\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nInstead I just keep on seeing the user/pass login screen again, as if I had the wrong password.\r\n\r\nBasicauth works without the hugo plugin, if I take out the \"hugo\" line I am able to log in with the correct user/pass and see a pretty 404 message.\r\nThe hugo plugin also works without basicauth, if I disable authentication entirely with no_auth, I am able to log in and see the file manager.\r\nThis all worked fine a couple months ago, then at some point some update to caddy or hugo broke it.\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nDunno. I was referred here from https://caddy.community/t/cant-log-in-with-basicauth/2865/3 I tested locally on a Windows 7 x64 laptop and I can confirm this issue.\r\n\r\nIt can be reproduced minimally with this Caddyfile:\r\n:2015 {\r\n\troot C:/caddy-filemanager-test  # the folder where Hugo generates the website\r\n\thugo /admin /admin # enable the admin panel\r\n\tbasicauth /admin username password\r\n}\r\n\r\nI can also confirm these behavior:\r\n1) If I don't try a \"user\" & \"password\" and click \"Cancel\" I get \"401 Unauthorized\"\r\n2) If I enter the right \"user\" & \"password\" then click \"Ok\" I seem to get a loop that requests credentials\r\n3) If I enter the right \"user\" & \"password\" then click \"Cancel\" I see the FileManager\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be the loop requesting credentials after a successful \"user\" & \"password\". I can confirm the same behavior with filemanager.\r\n\r\nWith this minimal caddyfile:\r\n:2015 {\r\n\troot C:/caddy-filemanager-test\r\n\tfilemanager /admin\r\n\tbasicauth /admin username password\r\n} I tested the [no_auth] parameter with filemanager and hugo and it worked with my minimal tests.\r\n\r\nIt'll probably resolve OP's issue.\r\n\r\nI would suggest adding a few lines in the docs here about this possible issue with other auth plugins:\r\nhttps://henriquedias.com/filemanager/caddy/ Thank you folks, hacdias's suggested Caddyfile did indeed fix my problem.\r\n\r\nI'm not married to basicauth though, I'd be happy to use Filemanager's own auth system. How do you use it? More specifically, how do you set your username + password? I see no information on how to do that at https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/caddy/ . It says I should create a new user, but offers no info on how to do that.  hi,\r\n\r\nis double click the only option to open the editor? i did not found an \"edit\" button. i want to edit a .htaccess file and wonder how to do it without renaming it.\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nmike this opens the download dialog I think this is a bug in v1.3.9.\r\nWhen I double click on the file \"messages.xml\" will open edit view ,\r\nBut double click on the other file \"config.yml\" will open download view.\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/816448/32313102-0c5994c0-bf6f-11e7-97ac-f49fc09b23b6.png)\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/816448/32313185-8e8f4aac-bf6f-11e7-91d4-a58db1043883.png)\r\n  I'm interested in using this project in a managed hosting context, where customers could use filemanager to access files. For that the default admin/admin credentials are a problem. Is it reasonable to add config/flags to set the default values for those?\r\n\r\nIt looks like it  could be a simple code change (plus a bit more effort for tests + documentation): https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/26e1e44d602b9bca5b1e20771095579f4a1c2b43/filemanager.go#L193-L196 - instead of using the string \"admin\" here, read a value from the config (not sure yet how to do that). config via env vars would be also nice https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig @hacdias since you added the label, does that mean you approve the idea?\r\n\r\nCould you point me in the right direction for reading the username and password from the config? Thanks for the pointers. I'll give that a try (or ask a colleague). Its possible that the only required change is this: https://github.com/var2dan/filemanager/commit/351dd8ee1244e231eb77b6efec57cb95dc2ab07b\r\n\r\nNot sure if that still merges into current master; probably also needs updates to tests and docs. Funny enough, im actually looking to use this project within Portainer as a way to provide users with a way to download files from existing containers persistent volumes. We have actually already added filebrowser as a template in Portainer, but we want to get even closer integration.\r\n\r\nWhere is the username/password actually stored? Is it embedded in a db or encrypted file somewhere?\r\n\r\nRgds,\r\n\r\nNeil Cresswell\r\n\r\nOn 15/06/2018, at 4:09 PM, 1138-4EB <notifications@github.com<mailto:notifications@github.com>> wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n@ncresswell<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_ncresswell&d=DwMCaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=0fx0h4vB56iTLpw2McH1ZD6TqG_QGpbggVOB-PfMJpM&m=vF_MO7_bc6o-dwelDVAmy1PTrv5eH-Dy1q3IIw2C0FU&s=vuyWnkvmBHkesp59BSc5NmwkuUxo1uk7idCVv4HcpuM&e=>, indeed, I got to know this project when you mentioned it in portainer/portainer#1380<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_portainer_portainer_issues_1380&d=DwMCaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=0fx0h4vB56iTLpw2McH1ZD6TqG_QGpbggVOB-PfMJpM&m=vF_MO7_bc6o-dwelDVAmy1PTrv5eH-Dy1q3IIw2C0FU&s=Z45T5bcdKsf51tP1ccVPKlVYQfy4zFbRHSd-UmEl6IE&e=> in november.

How do you like the idea of auto detecting the default locale from the browser?\r\n\r\nThe implementation is a little complex and breaking though. It should work that way, as `value.locale` is before `navigator.language`.\r\nhttps://github.com/Equim-chan/filemanager/blob/0271b914a422dd6dbf7cbc843a05f0f45ec585ca/assets/src/store/mutations.js#L30\r\n\r\nI also tested.

In other words, does SSL function on the development plan?\r\n thanks.  I would like to set the commands in the configfile that should be executed on specific events like 'before_save'? IT is not possible AFAIK, is it? What do you think? I understand your point ... well consider this situation:\r\nyou have a terraform configuration automatically setting up a complete cloud VPS with a caddy webserver and the hugo plugin. So good so far... to keep track of the users changes during the lifetime of the node you would like to save the changes via git. but to setup the commands you need to manually set it in the config. therefore it would be good to have a possibility to set those commands in the configfile.\r\n\r\nwouldn't it be possible to parse the commands during start and save them in the db during parsetime? what do you think of it?  ### 1.

Also, I previously was having trouble getting Caddy building prior to this as documented at https://caddy.community/t/cant-build-with-plugins/2749/5, but that may be completely unrelated. Success! File Manager shows up in the plugins list and the Caddyfile directive for it is working. I am able to login and use File Manager. Thank you!

Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\nI downloaded Filemanager from caddyserver.com on 9-8-17 around 5PM Central time.\r\nI downloaded the Linux 64-bit and the Linux ARMv7 builds and had this issue with both.\r\n\r\n### 2. What is your entire Caddyfile?\r\nThis is the Caddyfile I'm using on my raspberry pi:\r\n```text\r\n0.0.0.0:80 {\r\n    tls off\r\n    browse\r\n    filemanager / /var/www/file {\r\n        database /etc/ssl/caddy/filemanager/38182a6b6f9e373df981ed37d1431cc\r\n        no_auth\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n0.0.0.0:8000 {\r\n    tls off\r\n    browse\r\n    root /var/www/file\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere is the one that I used to test on my x86 desktop:\r\n```text\r\n127.0.0.1:8000 {\r\n    tls off\r\n    browse\r\n    filemanager {\r\n        no_auth\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nSwitch the view from the list mode to the grid mode. \r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nThe list of files changes mode right away.\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nWhen I click the \"Switch view\" button, a red popup appears in the lower right saying \"missing struct tag id or ID field\". The view mode does not change for the current folder. However if I click into a different folder, then the mode will have switched to the one I wanted. Then when I go back, by clicking on the house icon on top of the list of files, the mode will still be the way that I wanted it.\r\nHere is what I got from the -log option:\r\n```text\r\n2017/09/10 19:56:49 http://127.0.0.1:8000\r\n2017/09/10 19:57:00 missing struct tag id or ID field\r\n2017/09/10 19:57:06 missing struct tag id or ID field\r\n2017/09/10 19:57:16 [INFO] SIGINT: Shutting down\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nUse the second caddyfile I posted. Browse to 127.0.0.1:8000 and hit the switch view button. Tested with Firefox and Chromium.  My use case is that I want to use aria2 or wget to download something in background.  Perhaps if the commands that you run could be placed in its own tab (with an indicator if the command is still running or completed), that would allow for multiple commands to be run at the same time and cancelled if the user wishes to do so.  I think having tabs for commands would be a simple way to have a decent experience of adding functionality to this application. It appears you can already run multiple tasks in the background, but you can only see the progress of the last command.\r\n\r\nThe only idea I had in mind for a more advanced command system is a plugin system (for each whitelisted command like git, wget, aria2) that offers a seamless web interface for each command. Or the custom button functionality that can be tied to a command (as seen on one of the other tickets).   This is more a comment rather than an issue of filemanager.\r\n\r\n### The story\r\n\r\nI have my NAS server where I've installed filemanager: it is the best thing I could get, it is so awesome!\r\nThat PC is kind of old, it is the old good Pentium III 866MHz (from beginning of 2000), 256MB of RAM. Then I bought a couple of SATA PCI cards from eBay, plugged a bunch of hard-drives with SMART complaining and assembled everything in a RAID5 hopping I can still recover the data in case of disaster. In the end, I got a throughput around 6MB/s! And now, Filemanager is running on top of that.\r\n\r\nBut, Pentium III only have MMX and SSE instructions sets. The binary that is being produced in releases should be requiring SSE2 because I got the error `Illegal instruction` when I try to run it.\r\n\r\n### The solution\r\n\r\nI wrote a post about this issue, it can be found in [Compile Golang for 386 (Pentium MMX or later)](http://www.rigon.tk/documentation/compile-golang-386-mmx).\r\n\r\nI ended up running alpine inside docker, install Go and compile filemanager there. I created a script on Gist that performs this task automatically:\r\n[build-filemanager.sh](https://gist.github.com/rigon/7bd9a1ef23ad454c21b1405d8d51ef10)\r\n  This pull request is a chunk of my fork I use for some specific use case. I try to split my job to small pull requests to help to improve upstream :)\r\n\r\nThis pull request add `after_copy`, `after_rename`, `after_upload` and `after_delete` trigger.\r\nMoreover, when a trigger is fired, the trigger name is added to `TRIGGER` environment variable, the username which did the trigger is set as `USERNAME` and the scope of the user is set as `ROOT` (because otherwise when using specific scope, the `cwd` of the script run by the trigger is not correct).\r\n\r\nWarning: this pull request don't add the UI access to edit the script called by `after_copy` and `after_rename`\r\n\r\nWarning (bis): this change the `file` to `FILE` variable environment. Usualy, environment variables are in uppercase. Thanks :) Actually, good point, I'll add this ! Yeah ! Looks perfect !  What do you think?\r\nFilemanager doesn't need alpine to work.\r\n\r\nI've followed some hints from here: https://blog.codeship.com/building-minimal-docker-containers-for-go-applications/  Fix some details for Traditional Chinese.  When we download a packed folder, we have to wait while the sever creates the archive. It is possible to start downloading the archive while the server is still compressing, depending on the format. At least with ZIP is possible to do. Yeah, good! It easy to ask (as we say \"mandar bitaites\"), but when we have to implement is another story :P  When a file (or a packed folder) name contains a space, the downloaded filename just contains the first word. It seems to be a a problem with Firefox (I'm using 55.0.3 (64-bit)). I tested on Chromium and works perfectly. Here is a screenshot of the problem:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1102280/30159430-75c80a98-93c0-11e7-8575-27cc7de9551c.png)\r\n  It would be very nice if Filemanager autoplays musics and videos when they are opened.\r\nI also suggest to jump to the next file when a music (possibly, also videos) ends.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Autoplay\r\n- [ ] Jump to the next file. Sounds awesome!! :D  Thanks for this great tool! An idea for improved usability is to have the view mode saved in the db. Right now, if I log on from a different computer or from private browsing mode, it always defaults to grid and I always have to change it back to list.\r\n\r\nA related idea is to allow admins to set default view for all users  When I try to upload and replace a file, there is an error: 409.\r\nThe error is only one figure: 409.\r\nAny file will be wrong.\r\nI have just updated the latest version.\r\nThe previous version without this error. Ok, already can be used normally!  I'm using Filemanager + Caddy behind nginx (for logs and authentification).\r\n\r\nWhen I open a video, Caddy and Nginx use lot of CPU (it's an Atom server) to stream file.\r\nStarting a video or seeking is slow, even for small video.\r\nUsing Nginx for static file doesn't show this kind of issue.\r\n\r\nWith Caddy and Nginx:\r\nIt took 9500 ms to serve around 6 MB for first request on movie (not playing, only for `video` initialization)\r\nWith Nginx:\r\nIt took only 3500 ms for same amount of data (video preload=medata)\r\n\r\nIs it possible to configure filemanager to use Nginx / Apache to serve static file (https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/xsendfile/) ?  Very enjoy your program.It is splendidly and easy to use. \r\nNow, I want to provide some suggestion to help it better.\r\n1.May be you can add a function using the rar to compress the film. I think the function is sample but very useful.\r\n2.I think using Axel in the web to help user download file more easy is a good idea. 7z is ok. I only mean it can add a compress online function and a Multi-threaded download function......axel is Multi-threaded download in ubuntu.... Uh\uff0cmy English is no very good. Let me give an example. Now , I have a file call 123.rar and it need a passward to decompress. So , I add a command unar and run `unar -p xxx 123.rar`  in search box to decompress 123.rar. But ,every time I want to decompress a file. I need to write again.....You know it is cumbersome to use... Could you add a function to run it more easy? So we don't need to write the command every time...some useful command like rar unar axel..... Could you get an example for me? I am a beginner in Linux.  I don't quite understand what you mean... Thank you It is a good way to solve this problem. But, you konw different files may have different password and the terminal in the web is not very eary to run more one command....\r\nI am recommand a program to you and I hope we can use the same function in your filemanager oneday.\r\nhttps://github.com/genshen/sshWebConsole\r\n  Original title: Login screen doesn't use custom CSS\r\n\r\nWhile messing around with custom CSS (see https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/208#issuecomment-326781640), I noticed that the login screen doesn't have the CSS loaded. It only loads once logged in.\r\n\r\nIf you log out after having logged in, because of the SPA architecture, the login page is then styled afterwards \ud83d\ude06\r\n\r\nI'd like it if I could style that page so I can have my dark theme all the way through and not only once logged in. Oh - I was under the impression that was global CSS.\r\n\r\nWell, how about allowing admins to set global CSS? \ud83d\ude1b  Awesome. I'm excited to try it! :smile:   ### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\n\r\nYes; shortly after the 0.10.7 release.\r\n\r\n### 2.

What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n\r\nA response status of 200\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\n\r\n1. Get a permanent link for a file\r\n2. Delete the permanent link\r\n3. Visit the now defunct link\r\n4. Note the log: e.g. `...\"GET /share/id HTTP/2.0\" 200...`\r\n5. Note the response body: \"404 Not Found\"\r\n  I'm trying to run filemanager on its own port and behind an nginx proxy. (I want to type in website.com/admin and have it go to the filemanager UI)\r\n\r\nHowever, when I go to that page, only the index.html loads and every other asset is 404 (because it's looking for *website.com/app.js* instead of *website.com/admin/app.js*.\r\n\r\nI have spent 3 hours doing all sorts of nginx sub_filter configs but nothing seems to work. \r\n\r\nIs there a way for me to tell filemanager that the baseurl should be *website.com/admin*? Command line:\r\n\r\n`filemanager -p 42634 --staticgen hugo` Just to be clear and helpful, I would want to enter something like this:\r\n\r\n`filemanager -p 8080 --staticgen hugo --baseurl \"/admin\"`\r\n\r\nOr something like that. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, in the config file:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"port\": 8080,\r\n  \"noAuth\": false,\r\n  \"address\": \"127.0.0.1\",\r\n  \"baseurl\": \"/admin\"\r\n}\r\n``` Now the response that I get is 404 Not Found for the index page.\r\n\r\nI have tried:\r\n\r\n- \"admin\"\r\n- \"/admin\"\r\n- \"admin/\"\r\n- \"/admin/\"\r\n\r\nI have tried with both the docker version and the command-line version.\r\n\r\nI also went back and tried to proxy the normal docker container without the \"baseurl\" option and got the same result as before (index page loads, but all assets are 404)\r\n\r\nI can open up a separate issue...\r\n\r\n I was able to get what I want with caddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://mywebsite.com\r\ngzip\r\nlog caddylog.log\r\nroot public\r\nhugo\r\nfilemanager /admin\r\n\r\ntls {\r\n    dns digitalocean\r\n}\r\n```\r\n Now I can't launch filemanager:\r\n\r\n`filemanager -p 42634 --staticgen hugo  --baseurl \"/admin\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nunable to redefine 'p' shorthand in \"filemanager\" flagset: it's already used for \"port\" flagpanic: unable to redefine 'p' shorthand in \"filemanager\" flagset: it's already used for \"port\" flag\r\n\r\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\r\ngithub.com/spf13/pflag.(*FlagSet).AddFlag(0xc4200ea2d0, 0xc420196be0)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/spf13/pflag/flag.go:827 +0x45a\r\ngithub.com/spf13/pflag.(*FlagSet).VarPF(0xc4200ea2d0, 0x13c9b40, 0x14053a0, 0xabb812, 0x9, 0xab5a72, 0x1, 0xabc01a, 0xa, 0xc420196b40)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/spf13/pflag/flag.go:784 +0x120\r\ngithub.com/spf13/pflag.(*FlagSet).VarP(0xc4200ea2d0, 0x13c9b40, 0x14053a0, 0xabb812, 0x9, 0xab5a72, 0x1, 0xabc01a, 0xa)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/spf13/pflag/flag.go:790 +0x8e\r\ngithub.com/spf13/pflag.StringVarP(0x14053a0, 0xabb812, 0x9, 0xab5a72, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0, 0xabc01a, 0xa)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/spf13/pflag/string.go:53 +0xaa\r\nmain.init.1()\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager/main.go:56 +0x378\r\nmain.init()\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager/main.go:244 +0x9d\r\n``` It works!\r\n\r\nFor other people who might have this problem, here is my nginx config and command-line settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 80;\r\n    server_name mywebsite.com www.mywebsite.com;\r\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nserver {\r\n        listen 443 ssl;\r\n        server_name mywebsite.com www.mywebsite.com;\r\n        \r\n        #<SSL Stuff\r\n        \r\n        root /usr/share/nginx/html;\r\n        index index.html index.htm;\r\n        server_name localhost;\r\n        \r\n\r\n        location / {\r\n            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        location ~ /.well-known {\r\n                allow all;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        location /admin {\r\n                proxy_pass http://localhost:42634;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`filemanager -p 42634 --staticgen hugo  --baseurl \"/admin\"`  my configuration is \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11568297/29915530-b17aec1a-8e6e-11e7-8855-9a893748b0e8.png)\r\n\r\nhere is testfile directory \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11568297/29915615-ea8f0d10-8e6e-11e7-9d72-c3635a2c5783.png)\r\n\r\nwhen I access ip:92\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11568297/29915660-13443da2-8e6f-11e7-9784-4c1db9fe5f8c.png)\r\n\r\nlog is \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11568297/29915707-358fd6f0-8e6f-11e7-85ac-1796904699f1.png)\r\n Are you sure the default scope was set ? https://henriquedias.com/filemanager/configuration/ @ferronrsmith I follow this sample .https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.filemanager\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11568297/29919474-07eaa75e-8e7c-11e7-8f0f-c49fbb74623c.png)\r\n @hacdias Thank for your answer,it works  Tested this with/without add-ons and the performance was horrible locally.\r\nTest a different container and the performance was still horrible.\r\nTested in a Private mode and it works fine. Tested chrome (works) Tested again with FF 57.0a1 (2017-09-04) (64-bit) (Ubuntu Linux) same issue. I only use FF Got the same issue with FF 57.0a1 (2017-09-06) (64-bit) on my mac. I'm sure it has something to do with `XMLHttpRequest`.  If I have some time this weekend I'll submit a PR  It would be nice to be able to extract archives  I am very interested in this feature. Any idea about a possible release ? any update of this issue ? I did this, but I'm not sure, that it is best method to do that. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DeyV/filebrowser-dockercompose\r\n\r\n1. added p7zip to docker\r\n2. simple bash to unpack archives in directory and remove them\r\n3. this bash as additional command  \"commands\": [\"unpack\"]\r\n @DeyV, installing additional dependencies in the host (be it the 'real' host or the docker image/container) is an option, which can be used right now as in your example. However, I think that this issue is focused on integrating this feature in the code base, so that filebrowser can be still used as a standalone single binary app. E.g., https://github.com/mholt/archiver can be used to provide such functionality.  I think we should add version information to the interface.\r\nOtherwise it may forget the current version, and whether you need to upgrade. Also, whether the site title can be customized, for example: DOUBI - Files, DOUBI - Profile Settings, DOUBI - Video.\r\nSome interesting little details suggestion ~  Please consider to change the settings to tabs, instead of pages. I think it will be easier to navigate. I just came to write this exact same issue \ud83d\ude06\r\n\r\n+1 from me    Congrats for the great work you 've done for filemanager. \r\n\r\nI'd like to ask if there is any way i can have symlinked or mounted dirs to get shown in file manager.\r\n\r\nSay i have the following folder /someplace/folder1 and filemanager has access to /filemanager/files.\r\nWhen I symlink /someplace/folder1 to  /filemanager/files/folder1 i only see a folder1 file on filemanager.\r\nHowever if i mount -bind /someplace/folder1 to /filemanager/files/folder1 , i end up with an empty folder though /someplace/folder1 has files.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAris\r\n Apparently the symlink issue had been solved, but what about the mounted folder issue?\r\nThe mount point appears to be empty in filebrowser while it does contain some files.\r\nI'm using latest docker image.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nThibaut Never mind, I guess it is a problem with the docker volume + mount. It should work with the `shared` volume options. @ThibautMarty does it work if you start filebrowser in the host, instead of using the docker image?  Is the software have any support for an upload or deletion of file using the POST\\PUT\\DELETE methods?\r\nIf so can it be documented?\r\nMaybe an example using curl would help. @hacdias thanks!\r\nI will need to see how I am managing with this but it seems like a pretty straight forward and simple API.\r\n\r\nThanks!  \"Switch view\" is spelled incorrectly, which results in an incorrectly spelled tooltip on the \"Switch view\" button:  \r\n`./src/i18n/en.yaml:29:  switchView: Swicth view`  \r\n\r\nThis spelling mistake is also in `./rice-box.go`, as it is a generated file.  Great work! \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nA few suggestions of mine, if not planned yet and if feasible:\r\n\r\n1) Recaptcha optional feature at the login form\r\n2) ~password-change permission (in order to allow a password protected full guest access without risk of password changes)~ [DONE]\r\n3) directories size \r\n4) ~notify pop-up after share link copied~ [DONE]\r\n5) ...to be discovered yet :-P\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nP.S.: I'd like to translate it to italian language: if I compile a proper \"it.yaml\" file , would you kindly include it in next build? I'll keep up with possible subsequent updates, of course :-) Your responsiveness is gold, pal! \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\nAbout Recaptcha: maybe I misunderstood your words, but, based on using other Recaptcha-enabled script, domain and API key are simply mandatory end user related parameters, I don't really see how they could give trouble in integrating the feature itself, sorry...anyway do not go crazy on it...\r\n\r\nAbout Noty: I didn't know of it, seems straightful nice, thumbs up!  ### Instructions (remove before submitting):\r\n\r\n1.

If not using with Caddy, ignore questions 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\n\r\nYes, as of today.\r\n\r\n### 2. What is your entire Caddyfile?\r\n```text\r\nfiles.somehost.com {\r\n  basicauth / foo bar\r\n\r\n  filemanager / /media/somehost.com {\r\n    no_auth\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nUse a single HTTP-based login for all users.\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nA working install.\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nContinuous prompts for HTTP username and password, as well as redirecting to `/login`, despite `no_auth`.\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nUse the above config.  ### 3.

How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nJust select item and click on the share button    ### 1. Downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com\r\n\r\nhttps://caddyserver.com/download/linux/arm64?plugins=http.ipfilter,http.filemanager\r\n\r\n### 2. Caddyfile\r\n\r\n```text\r\nexample.com {\r\n    root /var/www/example.com\r\n    filemanager /filemanager /var/www/example.com {\r\n        database /var/www/example.db\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nValidate the config file using:\r\n```\r\nsudo -H -u www-data caddy -conf /etc/caddy/Caddyfile -validate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\n`Caddyfile is valid`\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n`2017/08/18 02:09:21 timeout`\r\n\r\nWhen the filemanager entry is removed from the config the validation succeeds.\r\n The validation logic might try to open the BoltDB database and that is where the timeout happens. `Bolt uses an exclusive write lock on the database file so it cannot be shared by multiple processes`. Maybe its possible to pass along a `&bolt.Options{ReadOnly: true}` if the validate flag is active. No hurries, was just looking into it :) Thank you! The problem is only there when the server is already running. The validate logic is also invoked when you send caddy a `SIGUSR1` to reload the configuration. At the moment a full shutdown is required to update the configuration. Maybe it is not such a big problem, but it is unexpected :) The validate flag is not present on a `SIGUSR1` signal. So checking for a flag might fix the validate use case, but the reload config on a running caddy might still fail. The restart logic that Caddy uses is here: https://github.com/mholt/caddy/blob/master/caddy.go#L144 To perform a graceful restart without dropping incoming requests it will start a new instance and then shutdown the existing instance. Not sure how to solve this using BoltDB. Maybe Badger is a solution: https://godoc.org/github.com/dgraph-io/badger It doesn't seem to lock the database file, however it also doesn't provide transactions so its functionality is at a lower level. hi\r\n\r\ni am experiencing this when using caddy in a swarm scenario using global replicas. The replicas wont start due to the timeout error. I remove filemanager and they work fine  Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm building `filemanager` from `master` and following `CONTRIBUTING.md` instruction.\r\nIt fails during `npm run dev`.

Thanks :)  I love the default look, but I'd love a dark theme even more. Are there plans to make a few basic themes built-in? Or has someone already made a dark theme I could use? I'm not too sure where I should be looking.\r\n\r\nThanks! I ended up tossing together a dark theme. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kElFKU0.png)\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody, #login {\r\n  background-color: #303030;\r\n}\r\n\r\nheader {\r\n  background-color: #1b1b1b;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.action,\r\n#breadcrumbs,\r\n#breadcrumbs span,\r\n.dashboard #nav,\r\n#listing.mosaic h2,\r\n#login h1 {\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#listing.list .item.header {\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n  background: #616161;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#listing.list .item,\r\n#listing.mosaic .item {\r\n  background-color: #424242;\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.dashboard {\r\n  background: #424242;\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1.0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nselect,\r\ntextarea,\r\ninput,\r\n.dashboard textarea,\r\n.dashboard #locale,\r\n.dashboard input[type=password],\r\n.dashboard input[type=text] {\r\n  background: #212121;\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);\r\n  border-color: #303030;\r\n}\r\n\r\nselect,\r\n.dashboard input[type=password],\r\n.dashboard input[type=text],\r\n.dashboard select {\r\n  padding: 8px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#search #input {\r\n  background-color: #424242;\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#search.active #input>.action i,\r\n#search.active input,\r\n#search.active #input,\r\n#login input[type=password], #login input[type=text] {\r\n  background-color: #303030;\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#search #result {\r\n  background-color: #212121;\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#search #result .boxes,\r\n.card {\r\n  background-color: #424242;\r\n  padding: 0 15px 15px 15px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#search #result .boxes h3,\r\n.card h2,\r\n.card h3,\r\n.card p,\r\n.card-content {\r\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#nav li {\r\n  padding-top: 1em !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nnav.active, #dropdown.active {\r\n    background-color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#file-selection {\r\n    background: #303030;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@hacdias if you look at the spots I added padding, I'd suggest considering using those in your base theme, to give a few of the elements a bit more room to breathe.

I made your fixes, plus added another at the bottom to fix a weird thing with the nav on the settings page. Updated my above comment.

Updated my above comment. No worries, have another small update for you; This fixes the white box on mobile when selecting an image. Before you were unable to see any of the buttons to share etc.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#file-selection {\r\nbackground: #303030;\r\n}\r\n```  ### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that? If no, and you are running a custom build, which is the revision of File Manager's repository?\r\n\r\nToday, version 0.10.6 of Caddy\r\n\r\n### 2. What is your entire Caddyfile?\r\n```text\r\nhttps://mydomain.com {\r\n\tfilemanager / F:\\\\path {\r\n\t\tdatabase hash.db\r\n\t}\r\n\ttls me@mydomain.com\r\n}\r\n\r\nlocalhost:2015 {\r\n\tfilemanager / F:\\\\path {\r\n\t\tdatabase hash.db\r\n\t}\r\n\ttls off\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What are you trying to do?\r\nHave filemanager accessible 2 ways, one via localhost, other via external IP\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nFunctioning site\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n```\r\nF:\\caddy>caddy\r\nActivating privacy features... done.\r\n2017/08/16 19:43:04 timeout\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run it with only one instance of `filemanager`, then it works fine. If I have 2 domains like `https://mydomain.com, localhost:2015`, it also fails. Seems like it probably has a mutex lock, and if there's 2 instances they're fighting for the lock?\r\n\r\nI'm running it on my home machine, and if I use the external domain I can't access it from my home network (because the domain resolves to the external IP). I could probably run CoreDNS at home and point my router to it to make the domain resolve to the LAN IP, but meeehhhh, don't feel like it \ud83d\ude06 \r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nRunning on Windows 10, just try to start up Caddy with 2 `filemanager`s pointing to the same DB Thanks! I tested the new build and it works great!  This is a great project, so much potential and almost exactly what I'm after. Here are some things I found frustrating that would really improve my workflow with this application:\r\n\r\n### File Viewer\r\nWhen viewing a file, it would be great to have an options to:\r\n\r\n1. Move the current file to a folder\r\n2. Select the the current file in view so you can browse photos and select a bunch to do a bulk move operation. I envision a workflow like: Open image file, select with `space bar`, go to next image with `left/right arrow` (already implemented), go to another image, select it with `space bar` then move all the selected files to a new folder. To be fair, this would be addressed in some respects with thumbnails and the file manager view.\r\n\r\n### File Manager\r\nIn the main file manager page, I noticed multiple selection using `ctrl` is working, but using `shift` to select a range of files is not. This would save \"a lot\" of hassle when trying to move a range of files.  The `User.Filesystem` is a struct of type `fileutils.Dir`.\r\nAny chance this can be changed to an interface instead? That would really make filemanager useful for embedded usage, something we currently evaluating. Hehe, that would have probably been my second issue, the User should be an interface as well.\r\nI am not sure if embedding is something you are going after at all but as the code looks today it's not really useful for our case, for example we have our own user database and the filesystem is a virtual one that merges several data sources.\r\nI still really like the project and if your are thinking about making it easier for embedded use, let me know I might help out a bit.\r\n \ud83d\ude04 Sorry, I think you can close the issue. I tried to change the `User.Filesystem` into an interface but there are quite a lot of place where it's expected to be a `string`. So, I gave up for now. Not highest priority in our project at the moment, unfortunately. I think you should close the issue if you don't plan to do anything about it yet.\r\n\r\nBTW: Someone from our team suggested if we could just implement the API for the frontend. Is there some kind of documentation on this? \ud83d\ude2e Sorry, I didn't get this. Yep, the example looks great. That would be bloody awesome. Awesome, will have a look as soon as I get time.\r\nThanks! Found time to look at it and now ran into a problem \ud83d\ude09 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/9301966eb7b539ec871d19e760372224498a973c/filemanager.go#L446\r\n\r\nThe FileSystem is now an interface but OpenFile returns a *os.File struct. This should be changed into an interface as well, probabaly a merge of these interfaces:\r\n- io.Reader\r\n- io.ReaderAt\r\n- io.Writer\r\n- io.Seeker\r\n- io.Closer  I'm testing filemanager with caddy and would like to know how to generate an authentication database to be used by filemanager before the caddy is started where I can associate a website hosted on Caddy with one or more accounts that are allowed to use filemanager to edit the site? Is this possible ?\r\n @hacdias In my case this method does not work. My users exist in a central database and I get the list of them - user, password and permissions - via an API call and with this information I create a Caddyfile on demand.\r\n\r\nI did another test with the following configuration in Caddyfile:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest2.sites.daspanel.site:443 {\r\n    errors stdout\r\n    log / stdout \"[DASPANEL-HTTP-ACCESSLOG] {>Referer} {remote} {when} {method} {uri} {proto} {status} {size} {>User-Agent} {latency} {request}\" \r\n    root /opt/daspanel/data/civmw76wg000001p2dwqxpvet/content/cj62tq3ti00005rnrilfs850o/v/2017-08-08-000431-062486\r\n    gzip\r\n    tls self_signed\r\n    header / {\r\n        X-Frame-Options        SAMEORIGIN\r\n        X-Content-Type-Options nosniff\r\n        X-XSS-Protection       \"1; mode=block\"\r\n        Referrer-Policy        no-referrer-when-downgrade\r\n        Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload\"\r\n    }\r\n   basicauth /_das/fm admin@daspanel.site aI81REN4a1H2gy3b\r\n   filemanager /_das/fm /opt/daspanel/data/civmw76wg000001p2dwqxpvet/content/cj62tq3ti00005rnrilfs850o/v/2017-08-08-000431-062486 {\r\n        no_auth\r\n        allow_commands true\r\n        allow_edit true\r\n        allow_new true\r\n        allow_publish true\r\n        commands git\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs expected, Caddy asks for authentication but after informing it correctly, the login dialog reappears again and again, no matter how many times I enter the login data. In addition, if I click the Cancel button in the Cady login dialog (Basicauth) the Filemanager login screen appears.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use Caddy's authentication middleware in conjunction with Filemanager?\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with the above example of Caddy setup?\r\n\r\nThanks Thanks. It's worked fine.  How can i change the default permission when  filemanager is running as a caddy plugin?\r\n\r\nthe documentation only  have the no_auth but no allowCommands,allownew & allowEdit part.\r\n\r\nin my current usecase it would be good to set the the\" allow\" settings to false while  no_auth is true. Does caddy download link automatically include the update or do I have to\nwait for next release version?\n\nOn Mon, Aug 14, 2017, 19:37 Henrique Dias <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I'm deploying to the Caddy server right now.

What are you trying to do?\r\nCreate user, with user's scope( say user1 ), and create a new file.\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you expect to see?\r\nI expect it can create user without the need to manual create the folder path on the terminal.\r\n\r\n### 5. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n1. user1's folder on the os has not been created\r\n2. the user's UI homepage shows \"This location can't be reached.\"\r\n3. it can't create new file on the user's UI.\r\n\r\n### 6. How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\n\r\nstart as\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilemanager -s users -p 5000 &> f.log &\r\n```\r\n\r\nlogin as admin, and then create user user1, assign the scope users/user1\r\n\r\nlogin as user1, see the homepage text (should not says can't reached), try if it can create new file.\r\n\r\nversion:\r\n```\r\nfilemanager version 1.1.1\r\n``` > It's the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nWe may have different scenery for the situation of creating user, I think it's inconvenient for the extra step to create the scope at the terminal.\r\n\r\nGood to know you'll thought about this. Good to hear that !   :+1:     I run the latest docker image of filemanager\r\n\r\n### What are you trying to do?\r\nUpload new file to filemanager, any kind of file, currently I test .md .txt .jpg .pdf, have the same result.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\nI can upload any files.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\nNothing happen, I check Chrome console log and see this.\r\n\r\n```app.633cd4387611b3c6a7fd.js:7487 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'findIndex' of null\r\n    at o.checkConflict (app.633cd4387611b3c6a7fd.js:7487)\r\n    at o.n [as checkConflict] (vue.esm.js:181)\r\n    at o.uploadInput (app.633cd4387611b3c6a7fd.js:7512)\r\n    at o.n [as uploadInput] (vue.esm.js:182)\r\n    at change (Listing.vue?6505:17)\r\n    at HTMLInputElement.t (vue.esm.js:1814)\r\n```\r\n \r\n[https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/dc7f389fdebf6af17e90675e3220d56e02ad68dc/assets/src/components/files/Listing.vue#L277](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/dc7f389fdebf6af17e90675e3220d56e02ad68dc/assets/src/components/files/Listing.vue#L277)\r\n I used both drag'n'drop and upload button. This issue happen when the folder is empty only, I create a empty file and it works.  It would be great to be able to share a folder or subfolder that will generate a unique link that can be shared. The link generated would have readonly permissions and allow an unregistered user to download. The link can expire or be a permanent share. @jivank complete! https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/pull/198\r\nDo not need to apologize, this is what i like to do.    New created folder gets  drw-r--r-- permissions\r\nCreating a file inside the folder via filemanager results in an permission denied error.\r\nChanging permissions manually to drwxr--r-- resolvs the error.\r\n note: i've tested it on a freshl downloaded caddy with filemanager as a plugin today  and got the error.\r\nMe too doesn't sees the reason why the caddy filemanager plugin uses 644 as permission +1\r\nIn my case (linux x64, standalone filemanager built via `go get` at 7ee721a), new created folder gets `drw-rw-r--`(664).\r\n\r\nWithout `rwx` permission, the folder is not actually \"writable\", and can't even be accessed by `cd`.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mZ6qv.png)\r\nRef: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21251/execute-vs-read-bit-how-do-directory-permissions-in-linux-work\r\nHopefully it helps. Hmm, the default permissions set for folders created by `mkdir` on my machine is 776. This should be fine.    If upload the same name file will prompt \"There is already a file on that path\"\r\nYou can add a function, prompt the user to have the same name file already exists, and let the user manually select whether to overwrite. By the way, if you later add the language file content, remember to inform me. :rofl:  @hacdias complete! https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/pull/189 @hacdias complete! https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/pull/191    @hacdias \r\nAlso, why is there \"post\"?\r\nFunctional misunderstanding can cause translation barriers. @hacdias complete!\r\nBefore specific function is not clear, it may be not accurate enough.\r\nhttps://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/pull/196    I have pulled the latest version of Caddy and the file manager plugin. Is there a way to disable the new auth features via Caddy directives? I have no desire for them (I front Caddy with an authenticating proxy already). Works perfectly @hacdias. Appreciate your quick turnaround on this and thanks for the great plugin!\ud83d\udc4d   ### 1. Have you downloaded File Manager from caddyserver.com? If yes, when have you done that?

How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behaviour as minimally as possible?\r\nDownload caddy from caddyserver.com and try to run. @hacdias all is good now.  Sorry for the false alarm, my version must have been a bit stale.  Thanks for the quick response.  Maybe you should add a note to v1.0.2, the command line parameters are not compatible with previous versions. \u263b  Would you mind doing smaller commits and debugging on a different branch, then squashing them and pulling the branch into master? There are so many commits here it feels like the commit count is getting way too inflated and a lot of them have little to no content.  Hi, [Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin) is an authorization library that supports models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC.\r\n\r\nRelated to RBAC, Casbin has several advantages:\r\n1. roles can be cascaded, aka roles can have roles.\r\n2. support resource roles, so users have their roles and resource have their roles too. role = group here.\r\n3. the permission assignments (or policy in Casbin's language) can be persisted in files or database (Gorm or Xorm or any popular DBs).\r\n\r\nAnd you can even customize your own access control model, for example, mix RBAC and ABAC together by using roles and attributes at the same time. It's very flexible.\r\n\r\nCasbin can provide more flexibility and security than the current way. I saw there's a ``Allowed`` method checks the URL with the regex in rule. This kind of matches is already supported by Casbin (see [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/wiki/Matchers#functions-in-matchers)). So you can directly use them instead of implementing them on your own. I can provide help on porting to Casbin. Let me know if there's any question:) Thanks.\r\n\r\nBtw: Casbin is also the authz middleware for Caddyserver (see: https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.authz). But that plugin primarily mediates the access on HTTP path (RESTful). I'm not sure if it fits for the file path in this project. Hi @hacdias ,\r\n\r\n1. Casbin can replace the ``Rule`` and ``Regexp`` structs.  Casbin will manage and store the rules for you. You can use the built-in ``regexMatch()`` function to implement the regex match. See the RESTful example here: https://github.com/casbin/casbin#examples\r\n\r\n2. ``AllowNew, AllowEdit, AllowCommands`` boolean values in ``User`` can also be expressed by Casbin rules as action. There are a lot of checkings like this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nif !c.User.AllowNew && r.Method == http.MethodPost {\r\n\treturn http.StatusForbidden, nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nif !c.User.AllowEdit && r.Method == http.MethodPut {\r\n\treturn http.StatusForbidden, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Casbin, you don't need to write this kind of checkings in every function. Just need to put Casbin into a filter that filters all requests (Casbin's middelware for web frameworks all work like this). Then pass in user, URL path and r.Method into ``casbin.Enforcer.enforce()``. Casbin will determine whether to allow the access. So you don't need to write security checks in such many places.\r\n\r\n3. I don't know why the above regex rule and AllowXXX permission are diverged in filemanager, but in Casbin, they can be in the same form of Casbin policy rules. For example, you can use a Casbin model like this:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[request_definition]\r\nr = user, path, action\r\n\r\n[policy_definition]\r\np = user, path, action\r\n\r\n[policy_effect]\r\ne = some(where (p.eft == allow))\r\n\r\n[matchers]\r\nm = r.user == p.user && regexMatch(r.path, p.path) && regexMatch(r.action, p.action)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe path is the original regex rule matching. And the action is the permission strings like ``AllowNew, AllowEdit, AllowCommands``. We also use regexMatch() here so you can use a grammar like (AllowNew|AllowEdit) to express multiple permissions. I think it's better than ``Permissions   map[string]bool``.\r\n\r\n4. Casbin not only simplify things. It also supports a [powerful policy storage](https://github.com/casbin/casbin#policy-persistence) and provides a [full-fledged policy management API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/wiki/Policy-management). So you will benefit from these features when using Casbin.\r\n  Addresses issue https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/173\r\n\r\nUpdated the Listing.vue and file.go files to allow sorting by last modified time.\r\n\r\nAlso ended up adapting how sorting works so instead of it being by name or not by name, sort can have 3 different values and sorting logic follows that.  We can currently sort by Name and Size but why does Last Modified not act in the same way? I'd like to browse directories so the newest files float to the top!  Hey guys - first of all: awesome plugin! : )\r\n\r\nWhen editing data for instance in `./data/menu.yaml`, these changes are only reflected once I hit 'Publish' in a `./content` file. From a UX point of view thats a bit suboptimal, imho.\r\nDo you have plans/ideas for this scenario? Maybe a global publish button in the sidebar or similar?\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote: hugo's default server will automatically watch for changes in `{data,content,static,themes}`. That would actually solve my usecase.\r\nIn older github issues I saw a `watch` flag being mentioned, but I cant seem to find it in docs/code.\r\n\r\nThx for any pointer & keep up the great work! Hello @hacdias - thanks for getting back so quickly! : )\r\n\r\nYep, that sounds great already! And will help my 'editor is editing data/media/...' usecase right away - would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThinking some more about it: consider the case that some other os process is updating a relevant file - would still be cool, if the site would get re-generated.\r\nDidnt get to read your code too deeply - do you run off hugo once you got a change event and/or can we start hugo in server and, thus, watch mode as well? Ha, works like a charm. Cool, thanks a lot, editor usecase solved! : D\n\nHowever, what do you think about the 'os process doing the change' usecase?\nIs it reasonable to have hugo run in the background with a flag?\nWill be some days on vacation now, but would be willing to contribute\n\n\n\nHenrique Dias <notifications@github.com> schrieb am Fr., 28.

Hi\r\n\r\nNo worries. I have a few other issues with publishing but this may all be related to the paths here so I will await an update and see if they go away. Unless, of course, you would like to know about them now.  Really great package! I wanted to hack around on the frontend part of project as I am really keen on Vue but couldn't get past caching of  `.js` files. Could you add a sentence or two on how to develop front-end code? I used `npm run dev` as stated but I'm still getting served with old files by service workers. Thanks! Yes. I'm going like:\r\n1. `yarn run dev`\r\n2. `go install github.com/hacdias/filemanager/cmd/filemanager`\r\n3. `go run cmd/filemanager/main.go --port 9100`\r\nBut no luck :( I've managed to get it working - I `clone`d the repo instead of `go get` :(\r\n\r\nSorry for inconvenience, I'll try to make up by adding some PR concerning front-end app. Cheers!  the Dockerfile use Multistage build (currently Docker hub not supported)\r\n\r\nUse [PWD](http://play-with-docker.com/) instead to build docker image\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2404785/28651700-ec2ed01c-72b5-11e7-8b15-2f270e57539c.png)\r\n ## rice\r\n\r\nI think rice-box.go need to be removed if we use docker build, \r\nOR just leave it alone for Github releases?\r\n\r\n## dep\r\n\r\n**pros**: \r\n * specify dependency version \r\n * simple?  dep init & dep ensure\r\n * more in [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) & [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LtMb090AZI)\r\n\r\n**cons**: \r\n *  will try it done OK\r\n\r\nInstruction for docker setup and Options (Volume) for Dockerfile  will update in the future.\r\nAlso need a dockerhub organization account for automate build(currently not support Multistage build) will fix Great! docker image size  is still large.\r\n\r\nAfter Docker Hub supported, need modify Dockerfile use Multistage build\r\nOr manually build in [pwd](http://labs.play-with-docker.com/) using multistage build and push to docker hub.

WHich OS and arch do you use? Debian 8, amd64. Here's the file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ltfl8l4h9st9ev/filebrowser?dl=0\r\nI tried it on a dir with more than 1500 files and it seemed fast. Initially it will only show 50 items and when you scroll down, 50 more will be added. (it has a bug when you select the file, but I'll solve it. just to make sure the pagination is good) Ok, thanks, I'll check at lunch ;)\r\nCan you control that the pagination is ok when we do a search? Uh, the pagination was just for files and not search results, but I can add that. Here https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ltfl8l4h9st9ev/filebrowser?dl=0\r\nAnd I made search case insensitive by default. Everything is working smoothly for now, much faster ;)\r\nI ping you, if we report bugs. Thanks !!\r\n\r\nYou're pushing this in release ? @arteta22000 1.9.0 coming soon!  I'm running this project as a way to remote access files on my local NAS, without the need to SSH or VNC into the machine.\r\n\r\nUpon running the project, I got:\r\n```\r\npanic: listen tcp :80: bind: permission denied\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I know how to change the port number of filemanager to not run on port 80, but I think you should change the default port number to be > 1024 at least as those are privileged ports and will require root on some machines.\r\n Thanks for the quick turnaround - I would suggest a different / random port because the chances are there are other programs using port 8080. This time it's about the ergonomics - totally up to you.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I'm running it on port 55532   If an error occurs while creating a file, fileserver panics on resource.go:165:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\t// Create/Open the file.\r\n\tf, err := c.User.FileSystem.OpenFile(context.TODO(), r.URL.Path, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0666)\r\n(!)\tdefer f.Close()\r\n\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn errorToHTTP(err, false), err\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because if an error occurs, then `f` will usually be `nil`. This deferred method should be placed after the error handling.  Hello,\r\n\r\nI noticed when you create a new directory, and try to upload files within it, you receive an error in the JS console. Thus, the upload popup never appears. See a screenshot below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-21 at 11 20 23 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1448289/28488956-57c1a664-6e6b-11e7-996c-2d4587754bd9.png\">\r\n\r\n# Temporary Fix\r\n\r\nSimply create a text file in your directory, upload the files, and then delete the text file \ud83d\ude04 \r\n  I spent a while looking for this, so I just wanted to help out :) Hello!\r\n\r\nYou are welcome! Took me 30 seconds to do this. Thanks for building the awesome plugging! Been looking for something like this for a while.\r\n\r\nThis, plus Caddy is a dream! \ud83d\ude04   Fixed a typo in the frontend of the app, great work! love using this in my personal server.  Hello,\r\n\r\nMaybe a `Copy Folder` function ?

I'm little afraid to test that (too lazy to reset)\r\n**bug**: click delete, click cancel, it shows user updated dialog\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1329716/28411558-6b73b7ca-6d84-11e7-8ae5-e914b77c76e6.gif)\r\n @hacdias it seems that it's still there... Firefox. Indeed doesn't happen on Chrome. However, the bug is caused by the \"delete prompt\" modal being inside the user form, and the `cancel` button is lacking a `type=\"button\"` attribute. The behavior on Firefox is correct. According to standard, buttons without a type attribute defaults to `submit`. And the cancel button being inside the form and having default `submit` effect cause the form to be submitted, hence the bug. I meant this cancel button https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/blob/master/assets/src/components/User.vue#L57 Yep, that's why I left the comment instead of sending a PR. I don't know much about Vue. So you could choose to add the attribute or move the dialog. Yeah confirm fixed  box-shadow: 0 0 0 0; leaves a slight edge on Firefox.\r\nbox-shadow does accept `none`, which works as expected. before\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1329716/28354809-a11abe7c-6ca4-11e7-83cd-82df0c04f35f.png)\r\n\r\nafter\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1329716/28354815-a8d82ec4-6ca4-11e7-8a76-1378299785bf.png)\r\n  works when trying to preview/edit text file, though An irrelevant minor bug, the download url `/api/download//my_img.jpg?token=...` has double slashes in it.\r\nRemoving which does not help. Just an FYI. console shows regular 403 error. no js error logged. Just tried: can delete with no problem. Also, search gives 403 as well. There might be something wrong with the token sent in the js, or the parsing on the server side. > Could you try logging out and logging in again to see if it works again?\r\n\r\nStill the same :( All failing (403) requests have the `token` in their params. That's why I made the deduction.\r\n>There might be something wrong with the token sent in the js, or the parsing on the server side. which isn't needed, because it's `auth` in the cookie anyway > Sorry for all of this\r\n\r\ndon't! that's a great plugin, and you are responding so fast!\r\n\r\n> Anyway, to make sure if the problem is the token in the URL: please try downloading a TEXT file that you can edit. When you click the download button, it will also generate a URL that has the token in it and ping me\r\n\r\n403 (great advice!) Yes FF :) proudly I don't know much `go` but I couldn't find many occurrences of `token` in go code. Could you point me to where this logic is actually handled? Just for learning purpose :) Ok I thought it was an upstream bug, but I traced all the way back to http.Request (I assume is from go stdlib?) and couldn't see anything wrong, I don't know this language well enough. Well, that's all the effort I'm going to put into this. I can see that the token is gone. However, I'm still getting 403s. Can you see anything wrong with my caddyfile in [this issue](https://github.com/hacdias/filemanager/issues/141#issue-243904290)? BTW username update is fixed, thanks! no I cannot download. delete and rename do work. and no I cannot search or execute commands, I tried `git version`, getting 403 as well. Actually, I think I know why. For the requests that do FAIL, they are sending a basic token instead of a bearer token. Ring a bell? Aha I'm correct\r\nI edited the request to change the token from the basic token to the bearer token I got from another request, I successfully get the image back!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1329716/28357600-63e9a36e-6caf-11e7-9a98-9153e7ba3725.png)\r\n Though I have no idea sending basic token instead would fail with a 403. Anyway, there's no need to save username and password locally if we have a jwt :) this should be made more secure. Are you storing username and password in the jwt? If so, this is the wrong approach to use JWT.\r\nEDIT: I see you are not storing the password in it, great :) yeah if you use basic token you are doing basic auth not jwt no it's not related to the basicauth config in my caddyfile though I see. My `/manage` route was under basicauth previously, I then took it out because now that it comes with its own auth system. However, the browser cached my basicauth token when I previously logged in, and is using it in requests that are not setting an Authorization header. I'm very sorry about this, wasting so much time of yours! This happens nowadays that people don't really restart browsers \ud83d\ude09 I tried a private session (which doesn't have records of my current session) and everything works as expected. My sincere apologies!  Is user looked up by username? If so, changing username would probably never work, unless you send both the old name and the new name.\r\n\r\nChanging password works.  ### 1.

When I go to `/saved` it also gets hijacked by `filemanager`. Thanks for the quick response! Hi, it's working as expected now. I found something else, I'll open an new issue.

Also , resize the image prior to displaying it in screen.\r\n\r\nhell - whilst i am at it, i stumbled upon filebrowser whilst looking for a way to display my photos over the net, with the system just publishing them as they sit on the filesystem... Any milestone for this great feature ?  ffmpeg is good at this stuff, but of course it requires ffmpeg to be installed in the host. Maybe we can integrate this feature if ffmpeg is detected on run time. Any idea?   Hi, I'm currently using the http.hugo as a small local cms to edit a webpage. I'm trying to figure out if the before_publish and after_publish parameters accept multiple commands. This is what I'm trying to do:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n127.0.0.1:1313\r\nroot hugo/public\r\nhugo hugo/ /admin {\r\n  clean_public true\r\n  after_publish git add . && git commit -m \"modified content\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the caddy file above my terminal builds the site as normally but after publishing it outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: unknown switch `m'\r\nusage: git add [options] [--] <pathspec>...\r\n```\r\nAs if I was trying to pass extra parameters to add. So far it seems these parameters are only intended for a single command, is it possible to chain multiple commands? Got it, will find a workaround probably with an extra tool :)\r\n\r\nBut just being curious, Is there a specific intended purpose for the before/after publish commands? It seems that just one command might be limiting. Probably a build script would be more suitable for these parameters? Thanks @hacdias for the tip!\r\n\r\nUsing on my caddy file:\r\n`after_publish bash -c 'git add . && git commit -m \"generic comment\"'`\r\n\r\nWhen building my terminal spits:\r\n`error: pathspec 'content' did not match any file(s) known to git.`\r\n\r\nBut with no spaces in in comments the git command works just fine:\r\n`after_publish bash -c 'git add . && git commit -m \"generic-comment\"'`\r\n\r\nFor what I wanted to do this will do just fine :)\r\nFor a more involved workflow I will try to find a more generic solution, as necessity arrives.\r\n\r\n**Note** that other functions have no issues with white space, for example:\r\n`after_publish bash -c 'echo \"spit out some text\"'` No error here  The following links in the Readme are currently 404ing\r\n\r\n- filemanager\r\n- root\r\n- basicAuth\r\n- errors    ```\r\n$ caddy -version                                                                         \r\nCaddy 0.10.2\r\n$ hugo version\r\nHugo Static Site Generator v0.20.6 linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-04-27T16:19:04+08:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1. What are you trying to do?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to run specific commands before/after hugo generate my website.\r\n\r\n### 2. What is your entire Caddyfile?\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple caddyfile to reproduce this \"bug\":\r\n```text\r\n:2017\r\nroot public\r\nbasicauth /admin user pass\r\nhugo {\r\n    before_publish echo \"before publishing\"\r\n    after_publish echo \"after publish\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\n`caddy-hugo` should run `echo \"before publish\"` and `echo \"after publish\"` before/after running `hugo`. \r\nAnd I expect to see `before publish` and `after publish` on screen output.\r\n\r\n### 4. What did you see instead (give full error messages and/or log)?\r\n\r\nI didn't see `before publish` or `after publish` on screen when I start `caddy`:\r\n```\r\n$ caddy \r\nActivating privacy features... done.\r\nhttp://:2017\r\nWARNING: File descriptor limit 1024 is too low for production servers.

How can someone who is starting from scratch reproduce this behavior as minimally as possible?\r\n\r\n1. generate a minimal hugo site \r\n    ```\r\n    hugo new site hugo-example\r\n   cd hugo-example/\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. create `Caddyfile` \r\n\r\n3. run `caddy` and you won't see `before publish` and `after_publish` on screen output.\r\n4. goto `localhost:2017/admin`, edit `config.toml` and click the `publish` button. Now you will see `before publish` and `after_publish` on screen output.  Can this be used with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) instead of Hugo? If so, where can I find the instructions? Thanks! @hacdias available as in, possible with Jekyll?! @hacdias could you expand on the basic usage? If I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nquark.business {\r\n        root /var/www/html\r\n\r\n        log /var/log/caddy/quark.business.log {\r\n                rotate_size 1\r\n                rotate_age  7\r\n                rotate_keep 1\r\n        }\r\n        header / {\r\n                Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000\"\r\n                X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"\r\n                X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\r\n                X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\r\n                -Server\r\n        }\r\n        tls {\r\n                key_type rsa4096\r\n                protocols tls1.2\r\n                must_staple\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my `jekyll` site is at `/var/local/jekyll/quark.business/`, how would I go to incorporate it? @hacdias did that. I can go to `https://quark.business/admin` and see a login screen. Now what? Sorry, totally lost. :-) I am going to be posting on the Caddy plugin community (https://caddy.community/) about getting this to run. I can login, but I can\u2019t see a way to publish the site, etc. More on https://caddy.community/c/plugins later today. :-)  It would be great to see some screen shots, better still to have a live demo of caddy-hugo. @hacdias Thanks, they look good and certainly help to get a better idea of caddy-hugo's capabilities. You should think about writing a article all about it and publish that on Medium. Good exposure.  In the current version, when \"hugo\" is run with caddy-hugo, the \"\"public\" folder is being deleted before hugo is run to generate the web site.\r\n\r\nCould this behaviour be made optional ? For example using a flag \"erase=false\" ? In certain circumstances it is usefull to keep the old files/directories. (This is also default hugo behaviour iirc)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hi @hacdias \r\n\r\n### 1.

If someone has same problem, check link    https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to use this program needs to know some Hugo knowledge.  I'm working on a Hugo app for [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) that enables one-click deployment of Hugo sites. Currently the app exposes a Git repository and expects the user to push content, at which point the site is automatically rebuilt and published.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to do is expose a web-based admin interface like this one. In order for this to work, I'd need to configure a command that gets run whenever content is edited. In the case of the Sandstorm app, this command would create a Git commit, which in turn would trigger a rebuild of the site. It isn't quite a Publish button, but it's close.\r\n\r\nThanks. Thanks, sounds great! The only point I'd make is that there likely won't \nbe a Publish option for Sandstorm since the site is published on save, \nso as long as I can disable the Publish button/functionality then we're \ngood.\n Oh, I guess I could do that, I wasn't sure if this plugin offered any \nfunctionality in addition to that. Perhaps I should file this issue \nagainst the filemanager?\n Sounds good. Thanks!\n Thanks, my apologies, finally getting a look at this after the holidays.\r\n\r\nShould this appear in the filemanager plugin as downloaded from the Caddy customizable download page? If so, then I'll try to integrate it into my Sandstorm package.  How do I create a new file? @hacdias thank you but it keeps spinning and not actually creates any file.\r\n\r\nWhat I did:\r\n\r\n1. Successfully run caddy with the example Caddyfile.\r\n2. Successfully open the admin interface. I can see the Add button there but:\r\na. I can only create a new file in the root folder (where I open up the terminal and run caddy)\r\nb. When I navigate to the 'content/post' folder, I click the button and fill in my-new-post.md. After that it keeps spinning and no file is created.\r\nc. I can create a new file in 'content/post' if I type in 'content/post/my-new-post.md' using the button in root folder. But the file does not include any archtypes that go with the theme I clone.  @hacdias no it just outputs the same th\u00edng that running hugo alone does. \r\n\r\nConsole in Developer Tools gives this:\r\n\r\n`application.js:43 Uncaught ReferenceError: token is not defined(\u2026)document.getElementById.addEventListener.event @ application.js:43`  Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm testing caddy with hugo plugin, when I try to publish changes the following error is thrown\r\n\r\n    application.js:120 Uncaught ReferenceError: token is not defined(\u2026)document.getElementById.addEventListener.event @ application.js:120\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I try to create new content:\r\n\r\n    application.js:43 Uncaught ReferenceError: token is not defined(\u2026)document.getElementById.addEventListener.event @ application.js:43\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caddyfile\r\n\r\n    0.0.0.0:2020\r\n    gzip\r\n    root      sites/hugosite/public           # the folder where Hugo generates the website\r\n    basicauth /admin user pass # protect the admin area using HTTP basic auth\r\n    hugo sites/hugosite /admin                      # enable the admin panel\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n Hi @hacdias,\r\n\r\nNow it crash on https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/blob/2e111eab9fef3d4b342a2077b527bf402aa70dd2/assets/public/js/application.js#L118\r\n\r\nRegards. No problem @hacdias, now it works like a charm!!!\r\nThanks. Regards. @mdaguete I've just downloaded latest cody now with plugin enabled, and still getting this error. \r\nCan you tell us when will this fix be a part of the build? Bummer! This is a little bit bad, because right now the admin interface is quite pointless. You need to restart caddy to see the changes.\r\nI've tried with the watch option from HUGO, but that didn't worked out. The files are not picked up by hugo. @hacdias I have found an older build, that didn't had this bug in.\r\nCan you please give an estimation when you think this will be added to the build? @hacdias there was a new release and the fix it's not in. ( or at least the bug it's still happening )\r\n @hacdias no problem. I'm still playing with the setup of the system. The ability to save and rebuild the website it's not crucial right now, but will be in 1 month. I'll wait for the official release I just wanted to report the situation. Would be great to have quicker updates when comes to plugins.\r\nThank you   After 1 or 2 builds, following trials will result in full site 404 and logs are here:\r\n```\r\ncaddy[23692]: runtime/cgo: pthread_create failed: Resource temporarily unavailable\r\ncaddy[23692]: SIGABRT: abort\r\ncaddy[23692]: PC=0x7f22f5ef7428 m=0\r\ncaddy[23692]: goroutine 0 [idle]:\r\ncaddy[23692]: goroutine 1 [running]:\r\ncaddy[23692]: runtime.systemstack_switch()\r\ncaddy[23692]:         /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:245 fp=0xc82001a770 sp=0xc82001a768\r\ncaddy[23692]: runtime.main()\r\ncaddy[23692]:         /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/proc.go:126 +0x62 fp=0xc82001a7c0 sp=0xc82001a770\r\ncaddy[23692]: runtime.goexit()\r\ncaddy[23692]:         /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:1998 +0x1 fp=0xc82001a7c8 sp=0xc82001a7c0\r\ncaddy[23692]: goroutine 17 [syscall, locked to thread]:\r\ncaddy[23692]: runtime.goexit()\r\ncaddy[23692]:         /usr/lib/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:1998 +0x1\r\ncaddy[23692]: rax    0x0\r\ncaddy[23692]: rbx    0x7f22f6286700\r\ncaddy[23692]: rcx    0x7f22f5ef7428\r\ncaddy[23692]: rdx    0x6\r\ncaddy[23692]: rdi    0x5d6c\r\ncaddy[23692]: rsi    0x5d6c\r\ncaddy[23692]: rbp    0xde500a\r\ncaddy[23692]: rsp    0x7ffeb1aca318\r\ncaddy[23692]: r8     0x7f22f6287770\r\ncaddy[23692]: r9     0x7f22f66c2700\r\ncaddy[23692]: r10    0x8\r\ncaddy[23692]: r11    0x206\r\ncaddy[23692]: r12    0x129b050\r\ncaddy[23692]: r13    0xdde684\r\ncaddy[23692]: r14    0x0\r\ncaddy[23692]: r15    0x8\r\ncaddy[23692]: rip    0x7f22f5ef7428\r\ncaddy[23692]: rflags 0x206\r\ncaddy[23692]: cs     0x33\r\ncaddy[23692]: fs     0x0\r\ncaddy[23692]: gs     0x0\r\ncaddy[23692]: 2016/12/04 11:11:36 exit status 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment: Caddy 0.9.3, Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, Linux 4.4.0-49-generic, inside a xen-based VM\r\n```text\r\n\u25cf caddy.service - Caddy HTTP/2 web server\r\n   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/caddy.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\r\n   Active: active (running) since Sun 2016-12-04 11:02:01 CST; 14min ago\r\n     Docs: https://caddyserver.com/docs\r\n Main PID: 23692 (caddy)\r\n    Tasks: 7\r\n   Memory: 13.4M\r\n      CPU: 2.249s\r\n   CGroup: /system.slice/caddy.service\r\n           \u2514\u250023692 /usr/local/bin/caddy -log stdout -agree=true -conf=/etc/caddy/Caddyfile -root=/var/tmp\r\n```\r\nResults of `ulimit -a`:\r\n```text\r\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) 0\r\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\r\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\r\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\r\npending signals                 (-i) 7850\r\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64\r\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\r\nopen files                      (-n) 65535\r\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\r\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\r\nreal-time priority              (-r) 0\r\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\r\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\r\nmax user processes              (-u) 7850\r\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\r\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\r\n``` @hacdias I am not running Caddy inside Docker, though there is Docker service on my machine. As far as I'm concerned this is because caddy has reached some system resource limit, but which limit exactly is not sure. I've checked anything I know but in vain.  This happens randomly. Haven't tried `hugo`, since it is a production server, usually I just reboot and the problem is gone (temporary). Will try next time. It haven't happened for several days. For anyone who have a similar problem: try raise max process number from systemd, since systemd ignores other limits (ulimit, sysctl, etc.)\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[Service]\r\n# ...\r\nLimitNPROC=256\r\n# ...\r\n```  hey,\n\nif I try to make caddy watch on changes in the directory with \n\n```\nhugo {\n    watch\n}\n```\n\ncaddy tells me\n\n`Unknown option watch`\n\nI am aware that changes via the gui trigger a rebuild but what about local changes during development?\nI would like to use this as a replacement for `hugo serve` with all the caddy-awsomeness.\nAm I doing something wrong or is caddy-hugo simply not meant to be used for this?\n Ok, that worked. Hot reloading seems to be a whole different topic so I might still have to rely on 'hugo serve' for some time.\n Sorry, docs will be updated before too long. :sweat:\n  When I entered 'git add .' in the command field, there was neither a change in the local repo nor did I ever get feedback. The laoding-circle kept loading forever.\n'git add content' resulted in the change being made in the local repo, but the output never reached me neither. It kept loading.\n No. Do I have to run caddy other than just 'caddy'?\n ok, so this is not so easy to track. It works some times, however as there is no output, I simply thought it had not worked. I will suggest a visual feedback on success in another issue. However the second time I got 403, but also no visual feedback. Why would that be?\n ok, the permissions might be the problem.\n  Imagine the following usecase:\nA static hugo website is persisted in a git repository. \nThe productive version is at the master branch and automatically updated to be served at domain.com.\nThe staging version is at branch 'staging' and served at staging.domain.com with basic auth.\nBoth environments would be completely separate.\nIt would be awsome if the administrator could define a button, in this case 'send to production'.\nIf an author finished changes at the staging environment, he/she would press the button, which would trigger a script like 'git add . && git commit -m \"\" && git push'\nThe administrator would then review the branch and merge it into 'master', which would lead to the production environment updating automatically.\n\nThe functionality needed from caddy-hugo would be custom buttons that could be created from an administrator. What do you think, is this in scope?\n  Just wanted to leave a \"Thank You\" here for working on this awesome project. It makes it really simple to integrate into my existing hugo/caddy setup and provides the possibility to include non-technical people for providing content\n I do, see the other issues \ud83d\ude09\n  I have a hugo site, generated with a fairly old hugo version.

But I downloaded from the website and it worked.\n Hello I have the same crash but on Linux. \nI recently downloaded the binary form url\nhttps://caddyserver.com/download/build?os=linux&arch=amd64&features=cors%2Cfilemanager%2Chugo\n\nI run binary under docker.\n\n```\ngoroutine 1 [running]:\npanic(0x9c7d00, 0xc420010060)\n        /usr/local/go/src/runtime/panic.go:500 +0x1a1\ngithub.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo.checkVersion(0xc42018ac20, 0x15, 0x11d6000)\n        /home/caddy/go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/installer.go:95 +0x15b\ngithub.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo.getPath(0xa285a0, 0xc4200f7dc0)\n        /home/caddy/go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/installer.go:50 +0x67c\ngithub.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo.parse(0xc420066360, 0xc4201464d0, 0xc, 0x0, 0xc420195728, 0x40efee)\n        /home/caddy/go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/setup.go:144 +0x13a\ngithub.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo.setup(0xc420066360, 0x4, 0xa60663)\n        /home/caddy/go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/setup.go:36 +0xb7\ngithub.com/mholt/caddy.executeDirectives(0xc4200f5860, 0x7ffd634bbf77, 0xe, 0x1223d80, 0x26, 0x26, 0xc4200ed780, 0x1, 0x1, 0x0, ...)\n        /tmp/custombuild_8822_359321299/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy.go:557 +0x597\ngithub.com/mholt/caddy.startWithListenerFds(0x11d18e0, 0xc42003ad80, 0xc4200f5860, 0x0, 0x64, 0x0)\n        /tmp/custombuild_8822_359321299/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy.go:455 +0x39a\ngithub.com/mholt/caddy.Start(0x11d18e0, 0xc42003ad80, 0x11d18e0, 0xc42003ad80, 0x0)\n        /tmp/custombuild_8822_359321299/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy.go:423 +0xff\ngithub.com/mholt/caddy/caddy/caddymain.Run()\n        /tmp/custombuild_8822_359321299/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy/caddymain/run.go:104 +0x26b\nmain.main()\n        /tmp/custombuild_8822_359321299/src/github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy/main.go:13 +0x1b\n```\n @mikeifomin   How recently? It seems the build server was updated 10 minutes ago :)\n @mikeifomin How recently? I updated it only about 12 minutes ago.\n Not so fast. about 1 hour ago! I'll try right now)\n Yes the crash is done. Now i have logs like this\n\n```\nIt seems that you don't have 'hugo' on your PATH.\n2016/08/29 16:41:06 It seems that you don't have 'hugo' on your PATH.\n```\n\nI think my case issue is solved\n Cool. Yeah, the hugo plugin now requires installing the hugo binary yourself. (It's better this way.)\n @mholt sure.\n\nP.S. big respect for such a fancy server like Caddy! \n  Is there a way to add access restrictions?  For example, only allowing someone access to the content folder?\n It didn't work. It does conflict with the primary admin. Shucks.\n That was @captncraig but he's been pretty busy lately.\n @hacdias I saw that! \ud83d\ude08 \n  i used a hugo [docker image](https://github.com/icyleaf/docker-images/tree/master/caddy) include hugo feature by default, but it does not running in normal:\n\n``` bash\n$ docker run -d -P 2015:2015 -v /path/to/hugo:/site -v /path/to/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile icyleafcn/caddy\n\nActivating privacy features... done.\nUnable to find Hugo on your computer.\nDownloading Hugo from GitHub releases... downloaded.\nChecking SHA256...checked!\nUnzipping... done.\nMoving Hugo executable... open : no such file or directory\n```\n\nCaddyfile:\n\n```\n0.0.0.0\nroot /site/public\nbasicauth /admin user pass\nhugo\n```\n That's great, thanks :)\n  That's a lot of logic. If you do implement it, I hope it works well. :)\n On the build server? [go generate is run on each build](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddydev/blob/cb87cf35a419542c2c2e0a7da73b0b70421074d5/caddybuild/build.go#L122-L123) - it does not set GOOS or GOARCH variables when running that command.\n  In Hugo's config it is possible to set the `metaDataFormat` to any of the three supported Front Matter formats which is the format that the Front Matter will be in when Hugo creates a new content item.\n\nBut caddy-hugo creates all Front Matter in JSON. Is it possible for it to use the format set in the config file of Hugo?\n @hacdias I created an issue there - https://github.com/hacdias/caddy-filemanager/issues/4\n  There seems to be a bug were extra fields are added to the Front Matter of content by itself (and causing issues with some content)\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Create a new content item... say `test.md`.\n2. Save this item (reloading the page shows that its Front Matter is correct).\n3. Create another content item... `test2.md`.\n4. Add a Front Matter field to this item and save it.\n5. Go to the first item (note Front Matter is still correct).\n6. Without editing anything, just save it.\n7. Reload the page to find the Front Matter from `test2.md` was added automatically.\n8. Go to site settings and again just save it.\n9. Go to one of the test contents and save it again.\n10. Reload to find the fields from settings in the Front Matter.\n## Issues it creates\n\nLets say a content item has a `type` for it to use a specific type or a `menu` field. Then going to an item that should not have the `type` or `menu` and editing it results it those fields being added to it (with no way of removing it unless if caddy is restarted)\n\nSo I guess some form of the previous data is kept in memory and then gets merged with future data. \n @hacdias great :smiley: .\n\nI will be using caddy-hugo quite a bit in the next few days so will also create some others bugs (that you will probably know about)\n Awesome, I take it that the fix is in the upcoming new release (for Caddy v0.9)?\n  Just adding a quick note so that users don't get confused by the unexpected message during `go get`. Please consider applying this. Thanks.\n  README incorrectly points to source files under `$GOPATH` instead of `$GOPATH/src`. This PR fixes that. Please consider applying.\n  Thoughts on the Preview:\nI think generally iframes are an an ugly thing, but maybe an iframe would provide a \"real time preview\" next to the editor, where the content would be regenerated on 2 seconds of not-typing. What do you think?\n Maybe just tell users to open temp in a separate window and put it on the right from the editor. \n\nAuto recompile should still be a thing in my opinion. \n\nAm 22.

I'm interested in using the software to help users edit their hugo sites after I build them. Toward that goal, I'm mostly interested in features targeting non-technical users. \r\n\r\nIn particular - having buttons along the top of the editor page on markdown pages for bold, italics, links, image, etc. would be particularly useful for people who don't remember markdown syntax. No need for WYSIWYG - just buttons that will insert the right markdown characters.\r\n\r\nIs that consistent with your vision of the project? Thanks for the great project :) But I am a little bit confused: the preview of a .mkv file appears to be soundless. Is that normal?

Can't wait to try out the `hugo` admin panel because this is basically what I wanted to develop myself before I discovered `caddy`.\n I've a lot of other work to do at the moment, but I will try to contribute when I got some spare time.\n Yeah, I already noticed :+1: \n\nYou forget to set the executable bit of `~/.caddy/bin/hugo` after downloading it. After setting the bit, everything works fine!\n\nInstallation steps (for anyone else):\n\n``` sh\ncurl -Lsf 'https://dl.bintray.com/hacdias/generic/caddy-hugo/1457193456/caddy_linux_amd64.tar.gz' | tar -C ~/bin -xvzf - -- caddy\ncaddy -conf ./caddy.conf\nchmod +x ~/.caddy/bin/hugo\ncaddy -conf ./caddy.conf\n```\n Yeah, correctly.\n Ok, thanks for your work!\n  This may be related to my unusual setup, but although content is served and built properly I'm unable to create or save content. We have static content for the main page of the site and are using Hugo for only the blog section. As a result, our directory structure is as such:\n\n```\n/opt/sites/mettle.works/dist/\n/opt/sites/mettle.works-blog/\n```\n\nWe then have a symlink pointing `/opt/sites/mettle.works/dist/blog` to `/opt/sites/mettle.works-blog/public`\n\nThen here is our Caddyfile:\n\n```\nmettle.works {\n  root /opt/sites/mettle.works/dist/\n  tls andy@mettleup.com\n  basicauth /admin admin donttellanyone\n  hugo /opt/sites/mettle.works-blog\n}\n```\n\nClicking \"save\" or \"publish\" gets me the following:\n\n![](http://cl.ly/fIKm/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-02%20at%2011.24.29.png)\n\nWent as far as setting permissions to a+w on the file with no luck. The XHR request (which goes to `https://mettle.works/admin/edit/content/about.md`) comes back with the following:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html class=\"no-js\" lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n  <meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#2196F3\">\n  <title>about</title>\n\n  <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700,400italic,700italic' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/admin/assets/css/main.min.css\">\n\n\n\n\n  <script src=\"/admin/assets/js/plugins.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ace/1.2.3/ace.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"/admin/assets/js/app.min.js\"></script>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n  <nav>\n    <ul class=\"container\">\n      <li><a href=\"/\"><i class=\"fa fa-home fa-lg\"></i><span> Go to website</span></a></li>\n      <li><a data-pjax href=\"/admin/browse/content/\"><i class=\"fa fa-newspaper-o\"></i><span> Content</span></a></li>\n      <li><a data-pjax href=\"/admin/browse/\"><i class=\"fa fa-folder-o\"></i><span> Browse</span></a></li>\n      <li><a data-pjax href=\"/admin/settings/\"><i class=\"fa fa-cog\"></i><span> Settings</span></a></li>\n      <li><a data-pjax id=\"logout\" href=\"#logout\"><i class=\"fa fa-sign-out\"></i><span> Logout</span></a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </nav>\n  <div id=\"content\">\n\n<div class=\"editor container complete\">\n\n  <h1><textarea id=\"site-title\">about</textarea></h1>\n\n  <form method=\"POST\" action=\"\">\n    <main>\n\n\n\n      <div class=\"frontmatter\">\n        <div class=\"blocks\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\"block\" id=\"block-date\" data-content=\"date\">\n    <label for=\"date\">Date</label>\n    <span class=\"actions\">\n      <button class=\"delete\">&#8722;</button>\n    </span>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <input name=\"date:string\" id=\"date\" value=\"2015-09-07T10:36:40\" type=\"datetime-local\" data-parent-type=\"object\"></input>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\"block\" id=\"block-draft\" data-content=\"draft\">\n    <label for=\"draft\">Draft</label>\n    <span class=\"actions\">\n      <button class=\"delete\">&#8722;</button>\n    </span>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <input name=\"draft:boolean\" id=\"draft\" value=\"true\" type=\"text\" data-parent-type=\"object\"></input>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <div class=\"block\" id=\"block-title\" data-content=\"title\">\n    <label for=\"title\">Title</label>\n    <span class=\"actions\">\n      <button class=\"delete\">&#8722;</button>\n    </span>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <input name=\"title:string\" id=\"title\" value=\"about\" type=\"text\" data-parent-type=\"object\"></input>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        </div>\n\n        <p class=\"actions\">\n          <button class=\"add\">Add field</button>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"content\">\n\n        <nav>\n          <a id=\"see-source\" class=\"active\"><i class=\"fa fa-code\"></i> Source</a>\n          <a id=\"see-preview\"><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"></i> Preview</a>\n        </nav>\n\n        <div id=\"editor-source\" data-mode=\"markdown\"></div>\n        <textarea name=\"content\">## About Mettle\n\nHi!

It would be extremely helpful to see how you install and setup and use Hugo for Caddy. \n Sure thing.  I'll try and have one up by wednesday.  Here's what I consider the most important things: \n\n1) Get caddy with hugo extension from [caddy's](https://caddy.org) web site.  Move the \"caddy\" binary to /usr/bion\n\n```\ntar xvf caddy.tar.gz\nmv caddy /usr/bin\n```\n\n2) Make a Caddyfile in the folder you want to serve content from and edit content with caddy-hugo.  This was tough for me.  Here's mine:  \n\n```\ncat Caddyfile\nsharebitstalk.io www.sharebitstalk.io technologistguild.com www.technologistguild.com {\ngzip                                                            # tells caddy to compress traffic\nproxy /         192.168.191.206:80                              # / tells caddy that it should proxy to the folder / and 192.168.191.206:80 Tells Caddy what URL to proxy at /\ntls             email=jake@klouds.org                           # Tells let's encrypt your e-mail address\n}\n\nchat.sharebitstalk.io {\ngzip\nproxy /         192.168.191.206:8065\ntls             email=jake@klouds.org\n}\n\nklouds.org www.klouds.org {\ngzip\ntls             email=jake@klouds.org\nroot            /root/hugo-semantic-homepage-starter/dist       # Tells CADDY which folder to serve as the root\nbasicauth       /admin faddat *******                         # protect the admin area using HTTP basic auth\nhugo            /root/hugo-semantic-homepage-starter            # Tells HUGO which folder to execute in\n}\n```\n\n3)   Save your Caddyfile and run caddy with the command, executed in the same folder as the Caddyfile.  \n\n```\ncaddy\n```\n Sure thing!  Thinks for the awesome tool, @hacdias!\n With Docker, it's easy.

I'm not sure how does AWS work (never used it). But if it's like a VPS it will work for sure.   When editing content on the shell or with sublime text 3 the changes are not recognized and not renderd. would be nice to be able to get the caddy-hugo watching the content folder\n Perhaps optionally. I wouldn't want these extra resources consuming my production environment, for example.\n But isn't it already a feature in Hugo to add watch to true to recognize changes and render them live?\n damn :-/ that is a little bit anoying so I have to restart caddy-hugo each time I update or add content?!\n I'd love to trade the CPU usage for the watching.  Just my $.02.  \n  If you do this, then drop \"true\", since if the term appears, we assume that means \"turn it on\"\n  when creating a new md file at the backend using post.md:archetype there are no auto created date field and title field created from filename is missing\n okay I understand just a little bit of it ... mostly I programm in windows c# and powershell ;)\n okay ;) then I will wait what you will be building =)\n  I would argument against this. Users should explicitly state the `style` they want to use. Boostrap is also fairly large, if so we should use something minimal like [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).\n If anything...some basic sample content with a simple theme [Cocoa](http://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/), or maybe [Type](http://themes.gohugo.io/type/), or [Pure Hugo](https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo).\n The basic sample content is a really great idea, it provides users with a framework when they get started.  Making that obvious helps tremendously in usability.  That way, the user can tinker and see the results of changes progressively.  \n\nI'm really digging this theme:  \nhttps://github.com/SenjinDarashiva/hugo-uno/\n\nMaybe that's a decent default?  :)\n I would've also preferred a bootstrap/skeleton as default; also (or as a start) an (empty) 'theme' options in the config would help hinting where the theme should go (and indicate that a theme is required) for newer users; especially since theme's tend to suggest the `hugo -t` command-line parameter\n @hacdias, I very much like the theming concept.\n\nOn Wed, Jun 1, 2016, 14:18 Henrique Dias notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hey @jlsjonas https://github.com/jlsjonas,\n> \n> Thanks for your suggestion.

I get the content of one Subdomain also running Hugo. with earlier version no problem with same caddyfile\n  I'm implementing this by just having leaps edit the text files that are used by Hugo-Caddy to generate pages from...... but it could be even greater than that, ya know?\n\nhttps://github.com/Jeffail/leaps\n Gotcha.  If it helps, I think that leaps has user management of some sorts.  I haven't gotten pro-level with its config file yet, however...\n Do you mind letting me know how to try?  Sorry, I keep taking baby steps towards golang but am not quite there yet.  I learned today from someone else it is very easy to integrate golang applications, but..... _knowledge peters out here_\n It was a really great article, by the way-- thank you!\n Okay, so: leaps uses JavaScript text areas to serve collaborative editing sessions.  The code for making one is quite simple.  Can you point out where caddy-hugo has its text areas?   \n\nI will give this a shot myself now.  If it works,I will send a pr your way.\n I'm hitting some difficulty in what I think are the last steps.  \n\n```\nroot@fuzzbox:~/hugo-semantic-homepage-starter# caddydev --source /root/caddy-hugo hugo\nCaddy source not found. Fetching... done.\nprocess killed: go get took too long\n\n---- COMMAND: go get -d caddyaddon\n---- \n---- package github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/assets: no buildable Go source files in /tmp/caddydev744094139/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/assets\n\n```\n I think I had, but let me try that.  I _think_ I fillowed your directions for developers exactly.  But maybe I didn't ;).  \n  I, too see this potentially becoming \"the way you put things on the web\".......\n  Perhaps best to let caddy-native facilities handle logins. Basicauth is availible now. If you make something better I would like to see it availible for any app running under caddy.\n ^ True. Auth should be generalized so that it's just another Caddy middleware (there is an issue for it already). But since there is demand for a better auth system, feel free :smile:\n Cool. I think https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues/246 and https://github.com/mholt/caddy/issues/109 would be of interest. If that gets implemented, then your add-on wouldn't have to roll its own login.\n\nI don't want you to stretch yourself too thin but if you feel like implementing a login system anyway, maybe you could consider writing a general-purpose middleware for it so any Caddy users could take advantage of it. Just an idea.\n I doubt it; I haven't heard anything in months.\n  Right now it's a really heavy investment to see what caddy-hugo does and what it looks like. A front end is sorely needed for Hugo and I'd love to see what's happening, but it's hard to invest the 30-120 minutes that it's likely going to take for someone not familiar with the process. For someone investigating Hugo, this means installing and learning Hugo, installing and learning Caddy then figuring out this plugin.\n\nJust a few screenshots + a list of functionality would go a long way towards getting people to take the time to install it, myself included.\n\nI'm super excited about this project and hope to see it continue to grow!\n Perhaps a brief tutorial or example could be added to [caddyserver/examples](https://github.com/caddyserver/examples) too.\n  Also, `commands.HugoCmd.Run` isn't using the parameters.\n :100:\n  caddy has changed a little and so caddy-hugo won't build properly.\n\nin hugo.go change:\n\"github.com/mholt/caddy/config/setup\"\nto:\n\"github.com/mholt/caddy/caddy/setup\"\n In the beta release, yes\n You can update your repo at any time. When Caddy 0.8 lands (beta period is over), I'll update the build server and all the dependencies and plugins at that time.\n  Will be nice but this is some funcionality. Maybe it's time to have some kind of roadmap?\n\nHere are some of my thoughts about the CMS in general. Forgive me if I'm writing nonsense :)\n\nUsually it is that the web interface is needed for people other than those who built the website. In my opinion, generally does not make sense to expand the functionalities to replace typing something in a text file by Admin. Hugo grows and it will be difficult to keep up with changes.\nI mean, potential visual construction of layotuts for different content types, assignment of field types to front-matter params in the GUI etc.\n\nAssuming that the goal is to facilitate the use of the Hugo by people who simply edit the page, I propose to implement user roles.\n\nTo leave webinterface as is - URL / admin and add another one but a little bit simpler at the URL / redactor. Redactor can only edit content of choosen type and allowed parts of front matter (configurable).\nAuthentication and security are issues to consider but in my opinion is not necessary to do anything with this in GUI.\n\nI think that the main use case in every cms looks like this:\n1. User is signed in 2. User chooses content type 3. User inputs some data (text, images, links) 4. Preview 5. Save, Publish\n\nSo these things should be top priority. Going forward:\n- focus at first on .md files (one format of content files)\n- to make in GUI some field to choosing existing content types ex. post, project, article etc. (layouts, templates, front matter already made earlier by admin). \n- to help redactors construct markdown content, by adding some typical editor features - small buttons on the top (image button, link button, header button etc.) For now they can put only placeholder into text. Next stage - some simple forms in the modals or hidden divs?\n- maybe fields you have proposed above, but somewhere you have to configure it (for example keywords - should have input field or text-area field in GUI?) Some Hugo sites doesn\u2019t have content at all, everything goes from toml/yaml values.\n Well, I promised to share ideas :smile: \n  I'm all for it. But keep code modular to leave room for contributors and their forks in the future.\nThere are no other generators besides Hugo ;)\n I vote to keep it focused - I'd rather have a plugin just for hugo. It'll be easier to maintain and use.\n Sounds good to me... make the directive `hugo` again as well, instead of `cms`? Since the directive is changing, maybe wait to push it to master until a new Caddy version comes out so users aren't totally surprised. Don't forget to update the docs too. (You can push to another branch other than master in the mean time.)\n  Hi, \nMatt encouraged me on Hugo forum to sent You some comments from my test.\nI could not write .md file. Here you have my experiences:\n\nhttps://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0WJtdOXm0casHF\n\nMaybe this is connected to OS user rights?\n\nI'll be happy to spreading also some suggestions regarding functionalities if You are interested.\n\nBest Regards,\n Also considering enabling error logging and see if anything shows up there related to that 500 error. (If not, then the add-on's handler is not properly reporting errors)\n Hi,\nAn hour ago I tested in Chrome browser too. I'm quite surprised because is working properly! ;)\n\"something-went-wrongs\" shows only in Safari (9.0/ OS X 10.11). Server responds 404.\n\n![screen shot 2015-10-12 at 21 16 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9997937/10436476/e2efd3ee-7126-11e5-963e-74c1b8117f00.png)\n\nRegards,\n  By the way. Notifications are quiet extraordinary :+1: \n That's weird. I wonder if there's a bug in Safari.\n\nBut that 500 Internal Server Error - do you get that in Chrome too, @adprof? Can you do it again in Safari but enable error logging first?\n\n```\nerrors error.log\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nerrors {\n    404 404.html\n    log error.log\n}\n```\n Also I want to see the contents of the access.log file which should hint at those 404s.\n I suspect that 500 may be due to an error in a front-matter. I'll give a try with another hugo theme.\nHere you have logs (first Safari, then after 404s - Chrome).\n\naccess.log\n\n```\n::1 - [12/Oct/2015:22:30:04 +0200] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 1024\n::1 - [12/Oct/2015:22:30:04 +0200] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 1024\n::1 -

O.o Am I reading that right?\n\n@hacdias I think you'll find these logs useful, especially the panic shown in the error log. (I think there might also be a bug in a Printf somewhere that's causing `%!c(MISSING)` to appear in the URL - maybe in Caddy core, maybe in this plugin; will need to look into that.)\n No problem, 404s shows after \"save\" and \"publish\". I didn't hit back button.\n ![screen shot 2015-10-12 at 22 59 04](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9997937/10438615/f4bb0aae-7134-11e5-9beb-c998e2801d6e.png)\n Of course, I'll do it tommorow (GMT+2) ;)\n Hi guys, \nI tried few times but still have some bugs. First I had problems with freshly updated OS X (homebrew issues). Then I followed docs, installed whole stuff and generated assets.go. But I cannot run caddydev with --source option. I cannot point properly source directory, because I got \"Invalid source directory\" or files are fetched from github and there is no assets.go. Are you sure that cli options functions are working properly?\n\nHow exactly should I run caddydev assuming that my clone directory is $HOME/Documents/Workshop/caddy-cms  ?\n\nMaybe much easier to do some tests with this topic bug is to cross-compile caddy with an addon in your environement (darwin 64) so I could use it and do some tests?\n\nprocess killed: go get took too long\n\nCOMMAND: go get -d caddyaddon\n\n---- package github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/assets: no buildable Go source files in /var/folders/t4/f0t0jt6s6bz6b2phjzprfslm0000gn/T/caddydev117150603/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-cms/assets\nRMac:newsite marcinrakiewicz$\n\nRegards,\n I suspect the `caddydev` errors are because of handling file paths in Windows... will look into it soon -- sorry, been swamped with a few other things.\n @hacdias Hi, I still have caddydev issue, a precompiled version is only working so I cannot check patched version.\n Hi, I downloaded build from page. Build is quiet old (exec in my filesystem is from year 1979 ;)\nI did quick check and:\n\n1 . 500 errror as before, but logged\n\n```\n[ERROR 500 /admin/edit/content/post/goisforlovers.md] parsing time \"2014-04-02\" as \"2006-01-02 15:04:05-07:00\": cannot parse \"\" as \"15\"\n```\n\n2\n\n```\n27/Oct/2015:21:43:15 +0100 [PANIC /admin/edit/content/post/migrate-from-jekyll.md] go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/frontmatter/frontmatter.go:56 - interface conversion: interface is map[interface {}]interface {}, not map[string]interface {}\n27/Oct/2015:21:45:24 +0100 [PANIC /admin/edit/content/post/creating-a-new-theme.md?_pjax=%!c(MISSING)ontent] go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/frontmatter/frontmatter.go:56 - interface conversion: interface is map[interface {}]interface {}, not map[string]interface {}\n27/Oct/2015:21:45:24 +0100 [PANIC /admin/edit/content/post/creating-a-new-theme.md] go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/frontmatter/frontmatter.go:56 - interface conversion: interface is map[interface {}]interface {}, not map[string]interface {}\n27/Oct/2015:21:45:28 +0100 [PANIC /admin/edit/content/post/creating-a-new-theme.md?_pjax=%!c(MISSING)ontent] go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo/frontmatter/frontmatter.go:56 - interface conversion: interface is map[interface {}]interface {}, not map[string]interface {}\n```\n\n3 .\nI tried also with source\n\n```\ncaddydev --source /Users/mr/go/src/github.com/hacdias/caddy-hugo hugo\ncannot place 'hugo' after '': directive '' not found\n```\n\nI have no time to test thoroughly today. I'll try in few days.\n\nRegards,\n @adprof Can you be sure to pull the latest caddydev and its dependencies?\n\nThen `cd` to the caddy-hugo repository folder and run `caddydev hugo` - that should be all you need to do to try it.\n @adprof Hi. Do you still receive any errors?\n  Hi! It's again me ;)\n\nI have this config `/home/toor/www/Caddyfile` ( `pwd` used here to show problem, original config have `command hugo`): \n\n``` yaml\nlocalhost {\n  root ./blog\n  cms {\n    content public\n    command pwd\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI've expected to see `/home/toor/www/blog/`, but \n\n``` bash\n$ caddy -conf=Caddyfile \n/home/toor/www\nlocalhost:2015\n```\n\nBut running caddy from `blog` directory let it works like a charm...\n\nI think you need to set current working dir before Run:  https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#Command\n But `root` directive sets current dir for serving content, not for running external apps... Maybe @mholt give us a hint.\n No, that makes sense. If the site is at /home/toor/www, the hugo commands probably need to be run from that directory (or somewhere around there).\n Currently there is no way to have more than one cms with one caddy file, because users from each cms can modify files of other:\n\n``` yaml\n0.0.0.0:8001 {\n  root ./blog1/public\n  cms {\n   content blog1/public\n   command hugo\n   args -s blog1/\n  }\n}\n\n0.0.0.0:8002 {\n  root ./blog2/public\n  cms {\n   content blog2/public\n   command hugo\n   args -s blog2/\n  }\n}\n```\n > Oh... I see. What do you want is to have a a directive where you put the path of the \"static-generator-content-things\" and it runs there, isn't it?\n\nmaybe, but this makes things complicated: root, workdir, content (not very useful) ...\n\n[search plugin](https://caddyserver.com/docs/search) use `search [directory] endpoint { ... }`\n\n> directory is a path within the site (can be a regular expression) that should be indexed. Default is site root.\n\ngit plugin also use similar thing. Anyway current dir for executing could be **root** or **user defined**, but not a caddy running directory.\n It can be root with [rewrite](https://caddyserver.com/docs/rewrite) :smile: \n\nI think it is better root than caddy workdir (if root is defined).\n\n> What do you suggest?\n\nThis syntax inspired by git and search plugin for consistency:\n\n``` yaml\nroot /home/toor/blog1/public\ncms /home/toor/blog1/ {\n  command ...\n}\n```\n I like it.\n\n> merging command and args too\n\nGood because it works in the same way as [startup directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/startup).\n  1. New md post\n2. Input content with **\"??\"**\n3. Save. Open browser network debuger. In form data you will see this: `{\"content\":\"\\r\\n\"}:`\n4. Again click save\n\n``` js\n{\"content\":\"jQuery2140322192081483081_1443556381439\\r\\n\"}:\n```\n ^ looks like a JSONP issue. (that jQuery21403.... looks like a JSONP callback function. your handler is probably getting JSONP back but expecting it to be body text or something)\n @mholt :+1:
