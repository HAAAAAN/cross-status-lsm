[{"repo": "AdGuardHome", "type": "elite", "title": "", "number of text": 1209, "text": "  Most likely, the task for it is #391   duplicate of #634  Duplicate of #446   DNS server operates with domains, not full URLs.\r\n\r\nThe only way to filter actual HTTP requests is to implement a proxy. Vote for this feature request if you'd like to have it: #391   Can you show application logs?  Maybe AGH doesn't have permission to write to querylog.json for some reason.  Hi there!\r\n\r\n> I was pretty disappointed to see that domains lists are not currently supported\r\n\r\nThey actually are supported since v0.96. If the rule is just a domain name, it is treated as `0.0.0.0 example.org`. This kind is behavior is expected from us by most of the popular hosts lists (like Energized or Malware domains).\r\n\r\n> Thus it's rather weird to see ||example.com$important be supported, whereas ||example.com$empty,important is not\r\n\r\nGenerally, our approach is simple: if the modifier is not in the list of supported, the whole rule will be discarded. \r\n\r\nThe easiest solution would be to add `$empty` to the list of supported modifiers, but I am not sure if this is the right way. `$empty` makes AdGuard return an empty response instead of blocking the request. This outcome is different from \"blocking\" as it does not look like an error to the page's script. My thinking is that when a filter list maintainer opts to use `$empty` or `noopjs`, they usually do it because simply blocking the request does not help or not enough.\r\n\r\nIf you think that there are some other modifiers that can be added to the list of supported, please tell me which ones. I am thinking about `$document` for both blocking and exception rules.\r\n\r\n> AdGuard Home's hosts file support seems to be identical to that of other hosts-file tools\r\n\r\nBut this is the point! These hosts lists are supposed to be used not just with AdGuard Home, but with any other tool that supports this syntax. Changing semantics on our side will make AdGuard Home different from others and unpredictable for those who create these lists.\r\n\r\nAlso, we do not encourage using hosts files syntax, and we don't use it in the AdGuard SDN filter. It's too limited compared even to the simple basic rules syntax, and the hosts lists tend to be huge as hell.\r\n\r\n> I hereby propose supporting or adding an option for treating www. and non-www. hosts entries the same.\r\n\r\nI guess we could do this for the domains-only lists. Unlike `/etc/hosts` syntax, we're more or less free in how we interpret them. Well, on the other hand, it's not too long until we roll out the experimental MITM proxy as a part of AdGuard Home. Unlike the DNS server, it will be able to apply content blocking filter lists properly. > I have however heard of issues with regards to custom certificates / clients and some apps being tricky to trust them without root - Is this similarly the case with the proxy?\r\n\r\nYeah, there will be some issues on Android, hopefully, we'll find a solution. Things are a little bit easier on iOS.  Subj.\r\n\r\nAlso, expose cache size setting to the yaml configuration.  Currently, they're hard-coded. We should allow changing them via the configuration file.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should be able to control its size in bytes, and not in the number of records.\r\n\r\nAlso, expose cache size setting to the yaml configuration. Consider using https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/fastcache > Fastcache automatically evicts old entries when reaching the maximum cache size set on its creation.\r\n\r\nIt removes *old* entry, instead of removing *least recently used* entry which is what AGH currently does.\r\nWith fastcache we will send more requests over network, than we do now, in case when cache capacity is reached.  Tbh, this is extremely complicated. I'll keep it open as a feature request, though.  > bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted\r\n\r\nCheck if there's another instance of AdGuardHome running in background Then you need to figure what another process is using this port\r\n\r\nUse `netstat -a` Here it is:\r\n```\r\nUDP 0.0.0.0:53 :\r\nUDP [::]:53 :\r\n```\r\n\r\nRead here how to find what process it is:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48198/how-can-you-find-out-which-process-is-listening-on-a-port-on-windows  <!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

I support option b.  We can add these settings related to query log:\r\n1. `query_log_mem_size 100` - how many query log entries we keep in memory before writing to file\r\n2. `query_log_expire 24h` - how much time we keep query log entries in file before they expire and are removed.  By default - 24 hours (this value is currently hard-coded).\r\nIf `expire 0` - don't store data in file at all.\r\n The problem of option b is that it effectively disables statistics. ...Also, we can add the setting with query log file path:\r\n3. `query_log_path ./data/querylog.json`\r\n\r\nRegarding statistics - yes, it's true that currently we won't be able to show full statistics if query log file isn't available, because the statistics data is generated by reading the query log file on startup.  So there are 2 options:\r\n1. Use separate file for statistics (another big feature)\r\n2. Agree with the fact that statistics will only be shown while AGH is running and it will reset on every startup.  > My personal suspicion is that DoH is that persistent HTTPS connections are used and it would stop DNS resolution until the existing connections times out.\r\n\r\nYeah, most likely this is the reason.  Shouldn't be a problem. Will amd64 be enough? As I understand, the library we use does not support FreeBSD:\r\nhttps://github.com/kardianos/service/issues/98  Please save the stderr somewhere, this is necessary to figure why it stopped.

Guys, if you're trying to convert adblock rules to the AG format, this might be useful:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/blob/master/Filters/parser.py\r\n\r\nBasically, here's what you need:\r\n1. Fork https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/tree/master/Filters\r\n2. Clean `exceptions.txt` and `exclusions.txt` and `rules.txt`\r\n3. Edit `filter.template` and include the filter lists you'd like to have there\r\n4. Run `parser.py`  Even after refreshing the homepage? We can convert MAC to IP only if the client uses AGH's built-in DHCP server. Oh, it seems we already have it:\r\n> Please note, that using MAC as identifier is possible only if AdGuard Home is also a DHCP server  Makes sense, thank you for the feature request!  This might be useful for the VPS setup case to see additional details about the IP address by querying the whois database.\r\n\r\nWe can get the organization the IP address belongs to, and the country code as well. \r\n\r\nRelevant library (maybe there are more):\r\nhttps://github.com/domainr/whois\r\n\r\n1. For an IP address, we can get `org-name`, `city`, `country`.\r\n2. We should query and print this information for every client IP (even if we got some info from arp/rdns).\r\n3. This should only be done for public IP addresses only.\r\n  Hi! The problem with high TTL is that you won't be able to easily unblock the domain -- clients will have it cached for the whole hour. It is too low for a VPS installation indeed, but I suppose that if you setup AGH inside your home network, extra DNS queries don't hurt much.  @planet0 hey, thanks for checking it!\r\n\r\nAnd what about these old weird issues you were having? #633 \r\n\r\nDid it go away with the new rapsbian?

I've just tested v0.96-hotfix and UI works fine after adding this filter.\r\nCan you show application logs?  If you have \"Connection is Refused\" error, then I think AGH just crashes.  Could it be due to yesterday's outage?\r\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/ It works okay right now so I guess we can close this indeed:)  Duplicate of #831 \r\n\r\nUpgrade to the latest beta version or switch to the `edge` branch if you're using docker.  I don't fully understand what is the question and what AGH has to do with this\r\n\r\n  Got it, thank you!\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the way it handles `^`.  Well, you know what, this is weird. I see the same clients in my VPS-hosted AGH.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, it might be someone trying DNS amplification attacks and scanning all public DNS servers. I can't see anything like this on our side, this is DNS amplification after all.  The only way to update AGH from v0.92 is to download the newer version, replace the binary, and run it. Make sure that you've replaced the binary.  Wouldn't it be easier to list your ISP ranges?\r\n\r\nWhois your IP address, find what \"org\" it belongs to, then query RIPE database to find all subnets that belong to it. Got it, could you please explain more about this domain idea? Would it somehow point to a dynamic IP? Yep, I got the idea. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that this won't be easy to implement as reverse DNS queries are asynchronous in the current implementation, but let's see how popular this feature request will become.  Guys, is this the full stack trace? I don't see our code in the stack trace, it's hard to figure where it comes from. Is there any issue if you change the upstream to `1.1.1.1` or `tls://1.1.1.1`?\r\n\r\nAs I understand, this happens only with:\r\n1. The `armhf-latest` docker image\r\n2. `macvlan` enabled\r\n3. RPI 3\r\n\r\n Got it, so it's just `macvlan`. This should be easy to reproduce then, thank you! So disabling `systemd-resolved` resolves this? Well, the only thing I don't understand now is what crypto/tls has to do with this all? \ud83e\udd14  Could you please run it with verbose logging enabled? Guys, what about using a different upstream? https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/831#issuecomment-502601441\r\n\r\nDoes it change anything? @vtacquet hmm, so this is not DOH.\r\n\r\nAnother question: do you have \"browsing security\" or \"parental control\" enabled? I'd like to figure out what this goroutine was doing before the panic occurred. Could you please record the verbose log (set verbose: true in the config).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we're trying to reproduce this on our side, but no luck so far. Well, that was easier than I thought, we should've started with the log :)\r\n\r\nThe new docker image will be soon available in the `edge` tag.  Duplicate of #454   Do you mean that you want AGH to listen to multiple IP addresses at once? In theory, you can configure it to listen to 0.0.0.0 and then use Access settings to limit the subnets it accepts DNS queries from: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_x7u8m_AdGuard_Home.png  Well, AGH works on a different level, it is not aware of what process connects to it.\r\n\r\nYou could configure your Firefox to use a different DNS resolver instead.  @arfaWong hi, and thank you!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that AdGuard Home is translated on Oneskyapp, please read the details here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#translate  > \"service\": executable file not found\r\n\r\nMaybe this?\r\nhttps://forum.openwrt.org/t/service-not-found-error/14384/6\r\n\r\nWe'll look into it later, but if there's anyone with OpenWRT who can help, we'd appreciate this. It might be that there's a problem with your openwrt configuration, read the relevant thread that I linked.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am not sure that this is it, maybe some other user with openwrt can come and comment on the issue.   \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 #435   AGH supports common adblock syntax where you can whitelist URLs with rules like `@@||example.org^`. Transforming the anudeepND's whitelist would be fairly easy.  Yeah, this is doable, but not too easy. Let's see how many upvotes it gets.  > however no milestone yet, likely we have to wait long time.\r\n\r\nAs of usual, it depends on the number of upvotes:)  Thank you!\r\n\r\nMerging into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/765  Currently, we cache the `version.json` contents for 8 hours. There should be a way to reload the file contents forcibly.\r\n\r\nHere's how to do it in the UI:\r\n1. Add a \"Refresh icon\" next to the version: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_r0rdb_AdGuard_Home.png (also change \"version\" to \"Version\")\r\n2. Click on this icon should trigger the update check.\r\n3. If a new version is found, show the regular \"new version found\" topline.\r\n4. If nothing found, show notification: \"AdGuard Home is up-to-date.  You can resize the column.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, this is inconvenient indeed.  Marked as low-priority for now. This can be done only when we're 100% sure the update mechanism is safe and stable. @Eyeborgs \r\n> It is also desirable that this feature be customizable to enable and disable it.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly would you like to be customizable?\r\n\r\n@ArchiveBase \r\nGood idea, but again, we'll need to thoroughly test the update procedure before providing the silent update feature.  Yes, otherwise it just does nothing.  Isn't it a duplicate of #454 ?  Well, everything can be changed through config, but anyway, this feature request would not be easy to implement.  The same issue with other global caches there.\r\n**We should not use global objects**\r\n\r\n```\r\n==================\r\nWARNING: DATA RACE\r\nWrite at 0x0000025ac810 by goroutine 36:\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).checkSafeBrowsing()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsfilter/dnsfilter.go:396 +0x693\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).CheckHost()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsfilter/dnsfilter.go:200 +0xc28\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsforward.(*Server).filterDNSRequest()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsforward/dnsforward.go:502 +0x4ed\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsforward.(*Server).handleDNSRequest()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsforward/dnsforward.go:445 +0x167\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsforward.(*Server).handleDNSRequest-fm()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsforward/dnsforward.go:437 +0x8a\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleDNSRequest()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:914 +0xf1c\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:625 +0x666\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).udpPacketLoop.func1()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:593 +0xe9\r\n\r\nPrevious read at 0x0000025ac810 by goroutine 37:\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).checkSafeBrowsing()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsfilter/dnsfilter.go:395 +0x343\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).CheckHost()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsfilter/dnsfilter.go:200 +0xc28\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsforward.(*Server).filterDNSRequest()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsforward/dnsforward.go:502 +0x4ed\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsforward.(*Server).handleDNSRequest()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsforward/dnsforward.go:445 +0x167\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsforward.(*Server).handleDNSRequest-fm()\r\n      adguard-home/dnsforward/dnsforward.go:437 +0x8a\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleDNSRequest()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:914 +0xf1c\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:625 +0x666\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).udpPacketLoop.func1()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:593 +0xe9\r\n\r\nGoroutine 36 (running) created at:\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).udpPacketLoop()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:592 +0x62b\r\n\r\nGoroutine 37 (running) created at:\r\n  github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).udpPacketLoop()\r\n      /Users/ameshkov/Documents/Work/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.14.0/proxy/proxy.go:592 +0x62b\r\n```  \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 ratelimit \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 -- 20rps, \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443. \u041c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e-\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c\u0443 - \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0442\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442-\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442, \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 Disallowed clients. \u0412 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 Access settings \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0430 DNS.

Hi, look for ARM archives here, they should work: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases  Yeah, I saw it. This is a very nice idea indeed, and we could use it for AdGuard DNS.\r\n\r\nHowever, AdGuard Home is a little bit different product that is supposed to control your home devices. There can be several ways of expanding into a \"cloud\" service, and we have not yet decided which one to follow.  The problem is that using `scratch` makes it significantly harder to troubleshoot any issue with the image. \r\n\r\nOther than that, I see no issues with this.   We're looking into it right now actually.\r\n\r\nBasically, we have two options:\r\n1. Use a resolver implementation written in pure Go\r\n2. Use `libunbound` + CGO bindings\r\n\r\n`libunbound` is a stable and reputable software, but the drawback is that it complicates things, and it'd be hard to cross-compile it for every OS. > there could be some handmade security bugs where unbound guys are well known\r\n\r\nWell, there is a much greater chance that there will be bugs in our implementation :) Just in case, here's everything I know about recursors and Go:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/issues/46 Experiments with CGO and unbound took A LOT of our time and the only thing that we understand now -- **we should avoid CGO** if we want to keep AGH truly cross-platform :(\r\n\r\nRe-assigning this issue to v0.98, we'll make a second try now with a resolver written in pure go.  @lordraiden \r\n\r\nHere's how it should look like:\r\n`/abcd.duckdns.org/192.168.1.220`\r\n\r\nSquare brackets just indicate that this part of the server line is optional, you shouldn't include them  Could you please take a screenshot of what you have in the filtering log?\r\nWorks for me just okay:\r\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_d9vz4_adguard-dns__-bash__14238.png Yeah, this will be handled with #818   Guys, this issue will be resolved in v0.96 alongside #535.\r\n\r\nI'll keep it open for now so that we don't forget to re-test it.  @szolin well, the point is that we **should** support it. @szolin yep, I suppose this would also solve this issue.\r\n\r\nWill we be able to include it in v0.96?\r\n\r\n  Sounds like a duplicate of #727 \r\n\r\nThis feature will be available in the upcoming update; hopefully, next week. Ah, my bad, I misread what you want.\r\n\r\nActually, you already can do it, just add these to your custom filtering rules. > Also, if they are added in the filters section then they resolve but appear as blocks domains.\r\n\r\nOkay, I shouldn't hurry that much :)\r\n Also, these two look relevant: #461 #390  Hi! It should be a prefix of the SHA256 hash, not the full hash.\r\n\r\nIt's all here in the source code:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/master/dnsfilter/dnsfilter.go#L673  Hm, this could be really useful for the VPS-hosted AGH. \"Clients\" settings do look relevant to this feature request, but I don't think this is the same entity.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it would be useful to allow having different configurations based on the different server IP addresses (for those who use plain DNS).\r\n\r\n> and in the backend parse the Host request header\r\n\r\nThis would limit this feature to DOH. In the case of DOH or DOT, we should read the TLS connection's SNI extension.  Not at the moment, but I marked this as a feature request. Let's see how many people vote for it. Wow:)  See the reason here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/428#issuecomment-495758858\r\n\r\nIn case if this flag is enabled, we should still indicate that the new version is available, but we shouldn't show the \"Update\" button.\r\n\r\n1. [ ] Command-line flag\r\n2. [ ] Use this flag in the Docker file\r\n3. [ ] Add information about updating the Docker image to the \"How to update\" section on Wiki\r\n4. [ ] Add information about updating the Hass.io add-on to the \"How to update\" section on Wiki\r\n\r\n@frenck could you please help us with the step 4? What should we link there? Recording what we discussed in-private:\r\n\r\n1. This flag is really necessary:)\r\n2. It should completely disable update checks, not just disable the auto-update I've just tried the image from the `edge` tag, and it tries to update anyway.\r\n\r\nI suppose we should mention this flag on Wiki: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/Adguardhome/wiki/Configuration#command-line\r\n\r\nAlso, there's no information about Docker and Hass.io updates on the Wiki page (see the checklist in the issue). The only thing we should write there is that the auto-update is disabled for them.\r\n\r\n  Well, it seems your VPN overrides DNS settings. Maybe your VPN service provider allows using custom DNS, you should ask them.  They use slightly different syntax so I guess no.  1. It should be built automatically every time there's a new commit to `master` pushed to the repository;\r\n2. It should be published to some static server/repo;\r\n3. It should use a different `versions.json` file for updates check;\r\n4. Version should be incremented automatically every time the new version is being built;  I am not sure if this can be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nEvery domain listed in any filter list is marked as blocked, why localhost should be an exception Pointing a hostname to 127.0.0.1 does not necessarily mean blocking. It just means that the client app will try to connect to 127.0.0.1 and if there's no one listening, the connection will fail.\r\n\r\nAlso, a hosts file can redefine `localhost` and point it to some remote IP. So highlighting the fact that there's a line for it in the query log makes sense - you need to be aware of it.  Well, it seems that CloudFlare DNS is not reachable from your place. You should contact your internet service provider and report this issue. @bestpika maybe the issue is with their DNS-over-HTTPS server only?\r\n\r\nWhat does AGH print to the log? @bestpika could you please run AGH with ` -v` parameter so that it printed more information? I can't see what's the root cause of the issue from the log. ```\r\n2019/05/20 17:01:23 17520#67 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.lookup(): failed to lookup for cloudflare-dns.com in 9999 milliseconds using 1.1.1.1:53: i/o timeout\r\n``` Bootstrap DNS is set to 1.1.1.1 and it fails to resolve the IP addresses.\r\nI have no clue why it works using nslookup, though:(\r\n\r\nTry changing bootstrap DNS to 8.8.8.8 and see if there's any change What happened after 4243? @szolin plz take a look, maybe you can see what's wrong here Does it work if you disable browsing security? So there's possibly an issue when:\r\n\r\n1. Parallel resolution is enabled\r\n2. Browsing security is enabled\r\n3. All upstreams require bootstrapping\r\n\r\n@szolin plz don't miss this Not really, it looks as if it randomly fails to resolve the upstream's domain name. I don't know why, though. Try a different bootstrap DNS.\r\n\r\nTry `176.103.130.130` and remove other addresses. Then I have no idea what's wrong, and I cannot reproduce this issue.\r\n\r\nI'll reopen this issue, maybe @szolin will see something It does not matter.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, for the first minute or so, AGH fails to bootstrap the addresses of the upstream servers. Maybe some firewall messes with it, maybe something else, I can only say what I see in the log.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly not a bug, but something specific to your computer configuration. I doubt it Again, it has little to do with AGH itself.\r\n\r\nAs I said, something is not okay with your computer configuration:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/770#issuecomment-493930324 @Onepamopa just in case, what OS are you using? Interesting, two identical issues both on Windows. This might be a bug of golang, we'll take a look at it. Reopened and assigned back to v0.97.\r\n\r\n@szolin could you please take a look at this? @Onepamopa thanks for the log, please wait till the next update.  Yeah, you should be worried about DNS amplification. Any public DNS server eventually becomes a target for such an attack.\r\n\r\nAdGuard Home has default rate limit set to 20rps which is generally enough, but from my experience  DDoSers are still trying to exploit public DNS servers even when the rate limit is low.\r\n\r\nYou will need to monitor the situation and block their IP addresses from time to time. For now, the only way to block an IP address is to use `iptables` on the server. In future versions of AGH, we'll add a configurable blacklist to the settings.  The issue will go away in v0.96 when we start using https://github.com/AdguardTeam/urlfilter library  Tbh, I'd prefer to sort this out by improving logging. It's easy to forget that you disabled logging for some of the clients, and then you just never know what happens with them.  This might be helpful:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/816 I can't reproduce it anymore  Yep, thank you!  Uninstalling the service? It's all there: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Getting-Started#service\r\n\r\nThe command:\r\n`sudo ./AdGuardHome -s uninstall` @All4Gears you need to run it with `sudo`:\r\n`sudo ./AdGuardHome -s uninstall`  Google's DOH server is on `https://dns.google.com/experimental` Yeah, you're right, thank you!  Hi! It just means that the root certificate is missing on your Linux machine.\r\n\r\nAGH looks for it in these locations:\r\nhttps://golang.org/src/crypto/x509/root_linux.go Well, yeah:)\r\n\r\nThere is another possible cause: have you copy/pasted the full chain or the leaf certificate only? If the intermediate certificate is missing, AGH won't be able to validate the chain (it won't be able to connect root to leaf). I am not an expert, but since it's Linux, it should be in one of the places listed here: https://golang.org/src/crypto/x509/root_linux.go  Check if you have \"Safe Search\" enabled in AGH settings. It forces restricted mode on Youtube.  AdGuard Home is not supposed to be running this way.\r\n\r\nYou'd better use a traditional ad blocker instead.  Thank you for reporting this! This needs to be addressed indeed.  Makes perfect sense, thank you!  Nope, it can't be done on the DNS level.  Merged into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/446  I'd still say this is a problem that the log is full of these internal DNS requests.\r\n\r\n@szolin let's modify `dnsfilter.customDialContext` and cache `addrs`.  Please try replacing Cloudflare DNS with a different DNS provider. Most likely, AGH cannot connect to it.  @alexzeitgeist thank you!\r\n\r\n@szolin plz take a look  Marked as a feature request, thank you!\r\n\r\nPlease note, that it uses NXDOMAIN for adblock syntax filter lists only. If you use a hosts file, AGH will respond with the IP address specified there. @szolin considering that it's done in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743, I assigned it to v0.96.\r\n\r\nThe only thing left to be done is updating Wiki: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Configuration#configuration-file  @280blocker thank you!\r\n\r\nI've marked this issue as a feature request. This is doable of course, but not as easy as we'd like to.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the temporary solution would be to use a simple nginx proxy on a different port.  Assigned to v0.97. We should see how the update from 0.95 to 0.96 will go. Hi all, any update on this issue? @jslawler thank you!  Huh, weird, now it's back:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.95-hotfix  First of all, could you please update to v0.95-hotfix and check if it's still there? https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.95-hotfix  \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d? @AlikhanAliev \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0441 SVG  List:\r\nhttps://kb.adguard.com/general/dns-providers\r\n\r\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_owcp6_AdGuard_Home.png\r\n\r\nText:\r\n`Here is a [list of known DNS providers](https://kb.adguard.com/general/dns-providers) to choose from.` Thank you! Plz ping me if there's no answer from him in a couple of days  Uh, I don't quite understand what do you want us to do. Could you please supply a little bit more details? Hmm, that'd be hard to change without breaking other user scenarios.\r\n\r\nIf you have any examples of this done as you like it, please post them here.\r\n\r\n> btw, as you said Adguard home almost perfect, thanks you guys doing great job, Thanks\r\n\r\nThank you!:)  @twu2 hi, how and where do you run AG Home? @twu2 also, could you please try running it with `-v` argument so that we could take a look at the detailed log? @twu2 also, could you please attach your `AdGuardHome.yaml` (delete passwords and keys from it) @twu2 thank you! The hotfix will be ready soon. @twu2 https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.95-hotfix   I just realized that we're passing resolverAddr via global variable and that can be done better.  Got it, thank you! It seems we need to quickly roll out a hotfix. @sugarfunk I've just pushed a fix\r\n\r\nCould you please check if it works okay? The updated build will be available on Docker Hub in 10 minutes (look for `edge` tag). Hmm, this is so weird -- `192.168.86.1:53: i/o timeout` -- this means that my change was applied. Any idea what could be wrong?\r\n\r\nThe original issue seemed legit (according [to this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319662/from-inside-of-a-docker-container-how-do-i-connect-to-the-localhost-of-the-mach/52858101#52858101)), though.\r\n Huh, thanks for the update! We'll re-check it tomorrow just in case then.  Here's what should be configured there:\r\n\r\nTitle: `Access settings`\r\nDescription: `Here you can configure access rules for the AdGuard Home DNS server.`\r\n\r\n1. Requests per second limit.\r\n2. Refuse ANY\r\n3. `Allowed clients` -- a list of CIDR or IP addresses. If configured, AGH will accept requests from these IP addresses only.\r\n4. `Disallowed clients` -- a list of CIDR or IP addresses. If configured, AGH will drop requests from these IP addresses.\r\n5. `Blocked domains` -- don't confuse this with filters. AGH will drop DNS queries with these domains in query's question.\r\n\r\n@szolin please note that these features should be added to `dnsproxy` first.  The idea is to have different client configurations.\r\n\r\nMockups:\r\n* https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_gpo58_Diagrams_-_AGHome_Clients__Moqups.png\r\n* https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_c1xw7_Diagrams_-_AGHome_Clients__Moqups.png\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I missed the `Name` field in the mockups.\r\n\r\nPossible \"client\" identifiers:\r\n\r\n* IP address\r\n* Mac address\r\n\r\n> Mac address is useable only if AGH DHCP server is active.\r\n\r\nWhat can be configured for a client:\r\n1. Blocking domains\r\n2. Browsing security\r\n3. Parental control\r\n4. Safe search Hm, this might complicate things. @szolin thoughts? Just when I started thinking there will be a release without a hotfix following it :)\r\n\r\n@szolin I can confirm, something is broken. @Vansinnet the build with the fix is available in the beta channel - `v0.96-3-g07db`.\r\n\r\nIf nothing serious happens, we'll publish this fix to the release channel. > Since this issue is now closed, should I open an individual feature request for this?\r\n\r\nYeah, unless #809 is what you want, then simply upvote it:)  What about this link?\r\nhttps://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-providers > yeah somethink like that i\u2018d think about, but in a more \u201eincludet\u201c way as i wrote up there \ud83e\udd29\r\n\r\nSo basically you want a beautiful list to choose from?\r\n\r\n> b) any ootions somebody could put more dns server into the list? or could the list autosync in parts with dnscrypt (work do twice makes zero)\r\n\r\nSure, you can PR it here:\r\nhttp://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardKnowledgeBase  See the details and the conversation here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720\r\n\r\nAnd here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1193#issuecomment-576862627  Makes sense, we will add a better explanation.\r\n @IldarKamalov please add this link:\r\nhttps://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering-syntax  @ezbiranik plz take a look\r\n\r\nThe first run might be problematic as we made it mandatory to run the initial configuration wizard under root. To solve this, we will need to provide some default configuration `AdGuardHome.yaml` in the container. > Why do you need root on first run?\r\n\r\nWe want to let the user configure the device -- for instance, set the static IP address. Also, running without root requires additional configuration (`setcap` for instance), and that's problematic for a regular user.\r\n\r\nThis all can be handled properly, but this requires additional work. I've created a feature request for that: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/723 Thank you! Summoning @ezbiranik again as I am not an expert on docker @szolin could you plz merge it properly (bitbucket first)  The only way is to do the following:\r\n1. Click \"Disable protection\" in AGH\r\n2. Go to settings -> enter your ISP DNS addresses instead of what you have there  Well, eventually we will get it, but at the moment it is not ready. There are no clients nor servers implementation, it's pure theory at the moment.\r\n\r\nHopefully, IETF QUIC will become a part of the Go language, it will make things easier.  @xhily what was the problem?\r\n\r\nIt's just this is not okay for AGH to crash, we'd better handle this case.  You mean this?\r\n\r\n![](https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_dy3gk_AdGuard_Home.png) @Zxilly I got the idea, thank you!\r\n\r\nMarked as a feature request, let's see how many people vote for it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, do you have any examples of the software that actually does it? What I am interested in is how exactly do they check if IP is available.\r\n\r\nDo they send ICMP (ping) the address, or do they actually try to connect to ports 80 or 443? Well, let's see how many upvotes does this feature request collect. \r\n\r\nIt is doable, but it is not easy of course.  It seems (#713 #712) people tend to load REALLY HUGE hosts lists, and with our current approach of keeping everything in memory, it leads to serious memory usage.\r\n\r\nHere's what I suggest:\r\n1. Serialize parsed filters to a temporary file on the disk\r\n2. Keep only index structure in-memory (and a small LRU cache with rules which are often used)\r\n3. Deserialize rules on-demand\r\n\r\nI think there are some existing libraries using more or less the same approach.\r\n\r\nUseful libraries:\r\n* https://github.com/recoilme/pudge\r\n* https://github.com/peterbourgon/diskv\r\n* https://github.com/recoilme/slowpoke @skynet01 \r\nYeah, this one will also be addressed by using https://github.com/AdguardTeam/urlfilter @skynet01 not yet ready, but it will be soon No, I am pretty sure this library has nothing to do with memory usage optimization.\r\n\r\nThe memory footprint of the AdGuard SDN at the moment is about 5-8MB, and for hosts-file based filter lists it's even less. The problem is that golang's GC is pretty greedy and if there's memory available, it prefers not to free it.\r\n\r\nYou can try adding `debug.SetGCPercent(10)` to `main.go` and rebuilding AGH, and see if this helps.  Do you mean virtual memory or RSS? How do you measure it?\r\n\r\nThe difference is quite important. Go is known to allocate quite a lot of VSZ, but it does not matter much, what's really important is RSS.\r\n\r\n> RSS is the Resident Set Size and is used to show how much memory is allocated to that process and is in RAM. It does not include memory that is swapped out. It does include memory from shared libraries as long as the pages from those libraries are actually in memory. It does include all stack and heap memory.\r\n\r\n> VSZ is the Virtual Memory Size. It includes all memory that the process can access, including memory that is swapped out, memory that is allocated, but not used, and memory that is from shared libraries.\r\n\r\n And one more question -- what exact format of the list did you use? I mean from this list: \r\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_9stf6_Energized_Protection_-_ad.porn.malware_blocking..png There's already a task for optimizing RAM usage on the filter lists: #714\r\n\r\nClosing this as duplicate. > AdBlock Filter\r\n\r\nThis is the most \"heavy\" format, hosts format will use much less.\r\n\r\n @rfgamaral AdGuard builds in-memory index structures for both of them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of hosts files, the structure is a trivial map while for adblock syntax the structure is much more complicated -> more heavy on ram.  > How heavy on RAM would that be once #714 is done?\r\n\r\nTwice less heavy, but anyway, adblock-based filter list will be heavier than the hosts file-based.\r\n\r\nWe might also allow serializing unused filters on a disk, but I am not sure if it's a right thing to do on RPi -- intense disk operations might hurt the SSD. > To conclude, is there any benefit in using an adblock based filter list or the support for that format is available just for feature completeness and/or flexibility?\r\n\r\nOnly if this filter list was created with advanced capabilities in mind (like AdGuard SDN filter for instance).\r\n\r\nIf this is a hosts file simply converted to adblock syntax, there's no reason to use it.  Could you please attach the `AdguardHome.yaml` file? @no-replies well, what I need is the filters section of the config.\r\n\r\n> Is there a reporting tool like in pihole.\r\n\r\nNope, not yet. > I don't see a reply privately option here either ?\r\n\r\nYou can send it to me directly to `devteam at adguard.com` Well, clearly we should optimize memory usage of the filtering engine.\r\n\r\nMerged into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/714 > Any idea how I can get it to restart?\r\n\r\nJust edit the `.yaml` file manually and remove a few filters from there. @no-replies is there a version of this gravity list that uses hosts files syntax?\r\n\r\nThis one that you linked will be considered an adblock list, and it will be parsed into a heavier structure. What matters is that it should look like this:\r\n`0.0.0.0    example.org`\r\n\r\nIf it is just a list of domains, AGH thinks that this is an adblock list. @no-replies let's wait for #714 then. AGH mustn't be that greedy for RAM as it is now.   @razz100 the issue is actually resolved, but it'll take a few hours for the filter list to be updated on the server Check your DNS cache:\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup 91mobiles.com 176.103.130.130\r\nServer:\t\t176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:\t176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nName:\t91mobiles.com\r\nAddress: 13.126.49.44\r\n``` Can't confirm it:\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup 91mobiles.com 176.103.130.130\r\nServer:\t\t176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:\t176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nName:\t91mobiles.com\r\nAddress: 13.126.49.44\r\n```  Otherwise, reverse proxies might be causing issues like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/709\r\n\r\n@IldarKamalov replace `ensurePUT` with `ensurePOST` in Go code to achieve this. Well, you still had the issue with response code 405, and tbh, you're not the first one with this issue.  Hm, I cannot reproduce this.\r\n\r\nAlso, `405` means \"Method not allowed\". I suspect you have some reverse proxy in front of AdGuard Home that does not accept `PUT` method. Do you have any?  I just don't see any place in the code where we return error code 405.\r\n\r\nAlthough, I guess we should stick to GET and POST to avoid issues with proxies.\r\n\r\n > That solves it?\r\n\r\nI think it does, but we'll have to check once it's ready.\r\n\r\n> However, how do you explain this problem when accessing without the proxy?\r\n\r\nIs it still a 405 error? Then there is still a proxy (no idea how so, though).  Hm, we just did test this on our side, and AGH receives the SIGTERM on docker stop:\r\n```\r\n2019/04/09 08:38:08 [info] Stopping AdGuard Home\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat does it print to the log in your case? It prints everything to stderr by default (unless you set a path to log file in the cconfig yaml) Try `docker logs --follow` (Frankly, I am not a Docker expert either :) ) Hm, so it should've flushed the query log just okay (the message about it is printed if AGH is launched with `-v` argument)  Got it! Please reopen if there are news about it @szolin could there be some race condition when we're stopping AGH? Marking this as a bug then. This one must be resolved in v0.96 Can you show application logs?  127.0.0.1 is the address of your local machine (so for your Mac -- this is the address of it, and for your router, this is the address of your router).\r\n\r\nIf you have AGH installed on your Mac, you might need to use the local address of it instead.  @nightah this makes sense indeed, thank you! We missed one thing here: after AGH started up and loaded the \"Top clients\" list, we should schedule top clients IP addresses for the reverse lookup. I see a lot of unnecessary errors in the log:\r\n```\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:01 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:01 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:01 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:01 [error] not a dns.PTR response\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:01 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:02 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:02 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:02 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n2019/06/04 16:27:03 [error] len(resp.Answer) != 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. First of all, these are not actually errors. Not every IP can be looked up, this is a normal behavior\r\n2. Second, the error message does not explain which of the lookups failed exactly. No rDNS lookups are made for clients that use DOH @Termi79 makes sense.

This seems to be a UI bug, @szolin plz confirm  @rfgamaral hi! A few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Could you please check the network requests in dev tools, do you see `favicon.ico` loading there?\r\n2. Could you please try a different browser just in case? This might be due to a favicons cache (at least in Chrome there's no easy way to clean it) Huh, okay, that's weird, as if nginx fails to proxify this request. There should be something about this in nginx log Hm, we don't write them:( But you can try opening this URL directly without nginx (or executing `curl`) and see what headers does it send.  Looks like a bug to me. Now the question is how to reproduce this on our side:) The issue appeared after we added gzip compression. The easiest way would be to disable gzip handler for `.ico` and see if it fixes the issue. > Thanks, any ETA for v0.96?\r\n\r\nIf nothing goes wrong, this week  @szolin this should be relatively easy to fix, assigned to v0.95  Wouldn't it be better to simply calculate more than avg?\r\n\r\nFor instance, we could calc: min, max, stddev, and median values.  Have you checked this?\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/tree/master/openapi  @toxicman2002 does it work okay when you disable protection completely in AGH?\r\n\r\nAlso, you could try to find the problematic rule by unblocking domains one by one in the query log. If the issue is there even when AGH is disabled, this might be caused by the upstream you're using.\r\n\r\nTry using your ISP's DNS address instead of Cloudflare DNS > I'va added my DNS from my ISP in the \"Upstream DNS\"-section and in the \" bootstrap DNS\"-section.\r\n\r\nAdded or replaced?

Also, the size in your log is right (4.7MB, v0.92 was 3.7).\r\n\r\nJust in case, could you please try this link (this is v0.94 I've just built it on my laptop)?\r\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_q0lqa_AdGuardHome_v0.94_linux_arm.tar.gz  What device/OS are you trying to install AGH on? @tolga7t are you running AGH with `sudo`? `bind: permission denied ` -- this error means that AGH is running under a user with limited privileges.\r\n\r\nIf you were running all AGH commands with sudo, this wouldn't be the case. It means you should type your commands starting with `sudo`: `sudo ./AdGuardHome`  Well, `sudo ./AdGuardHome -s install` should've been enough. Do you still have the issue? It's really hard to diagnose properly:(\r\n\r\nThe error text means that AGH is running without `root` privileges (maybe under a different user?), but I can't say why.\r\n\r\nPlease execute `ps aux | grep AdGuardHome` and check under which user it is running.  It looks as if it is running under root after all.\r\n\r\nWell, I am out of ideas, it can't be happening. Are you sure the error is \"permission denied\" and not smth like \"the address is already in use\"?  > What factors come into play with this calculation?\r\n\r\nThis is the average time spent on processing DNS queries starting at the moment when it enters AGH.\r\n\r\n> As a discussion point, would it be worth having an advanced filtering section do you think where we could filter out latency outliers as well as many other things?\r\n\r\nWell, for one, we should add the \"Elapsed time\" column to the query log, or maybe even add detailed timing there (i.e. see timing in Chrome's developer tools).\r\n\r\nWhat else would you suggest? Let's continue the discussion here and then file feature requests / tasks.\r\n\r\nJust throwing ideas for now, here's what can be possibly useful:\r\n\r\n1. Min, max, stddev, median values (not sure how to display all these without users freaking out).\r\n2. Stats per upstream\r\n3. Detailed timing (what part of the time was spent on filtering, querying upstream, filtering, querying browsing security and parental control web services)\r\n\r\nAlso, there was a feature request about prometheus endpoint, it seems relevant to this discussion: #516 . Generally, I like the idea. Doing all this will require a serious rework of the stats and the dashboard so we should do it in smaller steps.\r\n\r\nHere's what I see in the end (this is the ideal scenario, I just want to see the end goal at this point):\r\n\r\n1. Calculate detailed stats per upstream (requests count, detailed timing, avg/min/max/stdev values)\r\n2. `DNS Queries` value should have a hover-triggered popover with per-upstream queries count. For example:\r\n    ```\r\n    tls://1.1.1.1: 123123\r\n    tls://1.0.0.1: 32121\r\n    ```\r\n3. Avg. processing time should also have a popover with smth like this (I am listing everything here, but we'll need to find a way to fit it properly):\r\n    ```\r\n    tls://1.1.1.1 latency: 123ms\r\n    tls://1.0.0.1 latency: 321ms\r\n    Browsing security web service: 123ms\r\n    Parental control web service: 422ms\r\n    Filtering DNS queries: 1ms\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Add \"processing time\" chart to the dashboard.\r\n   \r\n    We could also unite the current four small charts in a single one, smth like this: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_7pvnw_Area_Chart_Example_-_JSFiddle.png  Well, the only problem I see with this is fitting other modules statistics (we're planning to add mitm proxy, and possibly a VPN/shadowsocks for those who're running AGH on VPS). Although, we will need to straighten up the DNS stats anyway.\r\n\r\nIf there will be no new comments or ideas about this in the next couple of days, I'll split this issue into a number of smaller tasks. @jslawler well, yeah, but the default timeout is 10 sec, so if it shows 130sec avg, there is a case when the request hasn't timed out properly for some reason.\r\n\r\n@LordMerlin if you run AGH with `-v` argument, you'll see lines with `RTT: xxxx` in the log. Please look for unusually high values there.  Yeah, this is a duplicate of #661. \r\n\r\nWe'll soon update the master branch, there are some bugs which are already fixed.  Currently, you cannot. AGH provides a DNS server, and for what you want we'll have to provide a mitm-proxy with filtering capabilities. Spoiler: we're going to do it eventually.  Hm, something has occupied port 68. Most likely, `dhcpcd` or `dhclient`, try disabling them.\r\n\r\nSounds just like this issue: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/657\r\n Duplicate of #657 Merged into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/686  Duplicate of #677   Hi! For hiding Google ads it is necessary to support cosmetic filters. This is not possible on the DNS-level, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we're planning to implement an HTTP proxy eventually, then it will become possible. @cdwmhcc \r\n\r\nAdGuard Home can block ad servers, and it does that pretty well.\r\n\r\nBut it is not as good as the desktop programs. Please mind, that AdGuard Home is a relatively new product. It will evolve eventually. > I want to ask AdGuard how to set up to filter ads, now it works, but can't filter any ads.\r\n\r\nHave you configured your devices to use AdGuard Home as a DNS server?\r\n Both ads on the screenshots require cosmetic filtering which is not supported by AdGuard Home yet.\r\nHowever, I can see that a lot of ad requests were blocked according to the stats.\r\n\r\nPlease be patient, this is a new product, we need time. @cdwmhcc there is a plan to add cosmetic filtering to AGH. It is not about money, the only thing required is time :)  Reminds me of https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/594\r\n\r\nSO is a good example, thank you!  Lock just for this client IP, username, or globally?  > Maybe an easy one but wondering if being over tls would have a negative impact on it.\r\n\r\nWell, it will require a little bit more CPU, but other than that nothing negative.\r\n\r\n> Plus what is the default behavior when parallel queries is not selected with multiple upstreams...\r\n\r\nIt will query upstreams one by one starting from the fastest one.  I'd prefer to have the option of using auto-translate.\r\n\r\nWe'll fix it a little bit differently, by adding a `content-language` tag. Huh, and it seems setting content-language does not fix the issue so we'll have to do what you propose :(  Makes perfect sense!\r\n\r\n> In the world of DNS sinkhole for ads users more often than not believe quantity > quality in regards to filters.\r\n\r\nYeah, that makes me sad  That'd be nice, thank you for the feature request!  Oh, so they have finally added an option to configure it on the network level. Great, thanks for the tip!\r\n\r\nThe corresponding task:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/268  @leon332157 what exact browser version do you use? > PS: This only seems to happen with a configuration Yaml file from older vesion: v0.92, renaming the old configuration and re-configuring fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nSo you were upgrading from v0.92 to v0.94 directly and something went wrong, right?\r\n\r\n@szolin could you please check if we have issues with upgrading from v0.92 to v0.94 I couldn't reproduce the issue with the default yaml config created by v0.92-hotfix2 (linux, firefox 65).\r\nCan you share your config file with us? Can you check whether your system really has a network interface with the name `enp0s25` (in your config file there is a setting `interface_name: enp0s25`) ?\r\nAnd if your network interface name is different, can you set the correct name in `interface_name: enp0s25`?  Does this help?  > i think i'm to stupid, but how could i disable webconfig on httpsport WITHOUT disabling DoT and DoH server...\r\n\r\nWell, the intention was to make the configuration simple, that's why there is none:)\r\n\r\n> any idears to deactivated or a go around? i' not really motivated go code back into nginx - http-proxy - AGH....\r\n\r\nFor the complicated configuration like yours, it is recommended to use nginx, I just don't see any alternative. Also, you already have nginx as a load balancer, why not just prohibit all locations except `/dns-query`?  @adrianh-za are there any \"steps to reproduce\" the issue? Does it happen for the same lists all the time, or the lists are random? The problem is that after filter is updated its name is reset to the value of `! Title` from the filter's contents.  Since those filters don't have their Title set, we reset filter name to an empty string.\r\n\r\nThis bug has appeared in v0.94, thank you for noticing it!  @szolin @IldarKamalov guys, please check what went wrong. Can we temporarily fix this by making some change to https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/master/version.json ?  @saltama hi! quick question: do you have any issues when you use DOH upstreams and not DOT? They rely on the native Go http implementation with it's own connections keep-alive mechanism. > Adguard started by systemd, doesn't resolve anything for 10 minutes or so, then starts working\r\n\r\nBtw, this sounds like another issue, and it is Rapsbian-related. Please check the last comment in this thread:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/633 `write tcp 10.0.0.165:58572->149.112.112.112:853: i/o timeout` -- this one means that AGH failed to initialize a new connection for the pool because of a timeout error.\r\n\r\nTbh, I suppose the issue is not the pooling, but something related to #633. We just need to figure out what exactly is causing this behavior.\r\n\r\nCould you please tell what device are you running, OS version, etc? We'll try to reproduce it on our side. > In that file there are 238 active goroutines, and most of those are either waiting on a mutex or doing tls or http stuff. I've only 3 clients in that network, if it matters.\r\n\r\nThere are several lines like `goroutine 27503 [chan receive, 20 minutes]` which means that those goroutines are waiting for TLS handshake to complete for about 20 minutes - and that's too much.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've made a patch that allows to set user-defined per-process limit in config file.  Is it convenient for you if I send you a binary file for your platform so you can check whether it solves your problems? OK, so you should edit config file and add `rlimit_nofile: <NUMBER>` setting like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nlanguage: en\r\nrlimit_nofile: 8096\r\ndns:\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn both your systems the default value is 1024, so 8096 should be more than enough.\r\n\r\n[AdGuardHome_v0.94-4-g0c86-dirty_linux_arm.tar.gz](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/3014257/AdGuardHome_v0.94-4-g0c86-dirty_linux_arm.tar.gz)\r\nSHA-1: 8e519c4d80397dbb4de1a266877b0399d6845730 > have you added a 30s timeout somewhere too?\r\n\r\nNo, it's definitely something else. Well, I must say that in your log there were a lot of \"too many open files\" errors, and it's hard to predict what kind of consequences they might be causing. So that might be the real cause. > For now i'm not seeing improvements\r\n\r\nWhat's your current `rlimit_nofile` setting value?\r\n\r\n> eg. 1000\r\n\r\nThis is way too low.  You were experiencing problems with 1024 (default), setting this value to 1000 will make it worse. > Your 8096, but i didn't check the log for specific errors.\r\n\r\nIt'd be interesting to check if there are any \"too many open files\" errors now.\r\n\r\n> The fact is that it's hard to replicate... at some point it stops resolving, it could be after a few minutes or after hours, something that makes me think about concurrency/resource/stuff_not_closed issues.\r\n\r\nI'll try running this script on my VPS with AGH, maybe I'll see something So it has been running for 11 hours and I have no issues so far:\r\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_2fx7x_AdGuard_Home.png\r\n\r\nI am guessing this must be something with your Rapsbian, and to reproduce we should have the very same configuration. \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n1. RPi version? \r\n2. What packets are installed? What are their versions?\r\n3. How is your RPi connected to the network? Wi-Fi, ethernet?\r\n\r\nBtw, could it be that your RPi may be losing connectivity at some point (networking restart for instance)? This might explain timeout errors. > Btw, booted up the pi 2 hours ago (my 4 usual tls upstreams+parallel) and checked now, still blocked at 100% cpu with hundred of threads.\r\n\r\nWell, it just means that queries to upstreams are still getting stuck on i/o timeout errors. \r\n\r\nIt sounds as if you have some kind of a rate limiter that starts dropping outgoing packets at some point.\r\n\r\nCould you please check iptables just in case?\r\n* `iptables --list`\r\n* `iptables -t nat --list`\r\n\r\n@szolin am I missing anything here? @saltama and one more thing to try.\r\n\r\nHere I slightly modified your script, now it just makes requests to cloudflare's DOH server directly:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ameshkov/d03f0e4f3014cb642d8766169a6855a6\r\n\r\nCould you please try running it for some time and see if there're any issues with timeout errors? In addition to https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/659#issuecomment-477923873\r\n\r\nThere's one more place where rate limiting might be -- this is your router. Try checking iptables rules there as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, if my script works okay, then the problem is not some rate limiting, and it means something is wrong with AGH (hopefully, it's not some golang issue). > Sure, will keep that running to verify that i still have connectivity toward clouflare.\r\n\r\nHow it goes, are there any issues with my python script? (check the stdout for errors)\r\n Thanks, we'll be waiting! See #633  Awesome, thank you!  Closing as dup of #652   Currently UI automatically executes \"Check for DHCP servers\" command and doesn't allow to switch DHCP server on if something went wrong on server side.\r\nAnd \"Check for DHCP servers\" command doesn't work reliably because it tries to bind on port 68 (which is by default opened by dhcpcd or dhclient daemons).\r\nSo we should rework the process of how we check for another DHCP server running on the system.\r\n\r\n@planet0 As a work-around, you can manually edit yaml config file and set `enabled true` in `dhcp` section. So the task is as follows:\r\nIf client's request is\r\n\r\n`POST /control/dhcp/find_active_dhcp`\r\n\r\nand server responds with\r\n\r\n`{\"error\":...}`\r\n\r\nallow the user to click on button \"Enable DHCP Server\".\r\nAnd show this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe couldn't determine whether an another DHCP server exists in the network.\r\nError details:\r\nCouldn't listen to 192.169.56.1:68, cause: listen udp4 192.169.56.1:68: bind: address already in use\r\n\r\nIf you want to enable DHCP server anyway, make sure that there is no other active DHCP server in your network. Otherwise, it can break the Internet for connected devices!\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: message \"If you want to enable...\" is changed a little bit.\r\n\r\nDon't show the message \"If you want to enable...\" if server responds with {\"found\":false} to request \"POST /control/dhcp/find_active_dhcp\".\r\n\r\nThe message \"Error details\" may be expandable on-click.\r\n I just realized that this means that the port is occupied by the DHCP client, and we should not run DHCP server unless the DHCP client is stopped and IP is set to be static.\r\n\r\n@szolin wouldn't it be better to automate it here? Merged into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/686  Yeah, and I just got this on mobile :(  @IldarKamalov when `0.0.0.0` is selected, you should redirect user to the same `document.location.hostname` she has at the moment.  Weird, I've just analyzed my AGH v0.94 on SSLLabs, and SSL3 is disabled.\r\nDo you have any nginx proxy or smth like that?

My AGH was built with Go 1.11, it's no the same version as the one attached to release. So yeah, this must be a legit issue. @Techguyprivate \r\n\r\nWe don't provide any additional settings at the moment. Generally, the `MinVersion` field of `tls.Config` object needs to be modified: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/master/app.go#L184 \r\n\r\nI guess it does not make much sense to continue supporting TLS 1.1 and below, all the modern browsers use TLS 1.2 or newer.\r\n\r\n@admitrevskiy please note that we should change this in `dnsproxy` as well.  These pages are hosted on the server side, translating them in AGH will be possible when we finish with #454 \r\n\r\n What for the server side, we'll update their translations in due course (update of AG DNS is required, and it will happen later)  Makes sense, thank you!  We should use `https` for both parental control and browsing security web service. Why in the world we have http there?  * `8.8.8.8` -- bootstrap DNS (resolving the IP address of a DOT/DOH resolver). You can configure it in `AdGuardHome.yaml` btw.\r\n* `192.168.1.1\t53` -- this must be your network default resolver which is used when AGH downloads filters updates (we don't use custom resolvers for these connections, maybe we should btw).\r\n* `198.255.78.6\t53` -- no idea, maybe your secondary resolver?\r\n* `::ffff:127.0.0.1\t56331` -- this is localhost.\r\n\r\n* `176.103.133.60\t80` -- `sb.adtidy.org` (browsing security web service, read the explanation in AGH settings). Also, using port 80 is a mistake, we should be using `https` by default for these connections.\r\n\r\nMost likely these are IP addresses of the filter lists servers (check their domains):\r\n* `104.20.30.130\t80` \r\n* `143.215.130.61\t80`\r\n* `143.215.130.61\t80`\r\n* `2606:4700:10::6814:1e82\t9`\r\n\r\nCloudflare IP addresses (853 is the DNS-over-TLS port)\r\n* `1.1.1.1\t853`\r\n* `1.0.0.1\t853`\r\n* `2606:4700:4700::1111\t9`\r\n* `2606:4700:4700::1001\t9`\r\n\r\n @All4Gears \r\n\r\nIdeally, you need to whitelist all of them OR you need to change AGH settings.\r\n\r\nHere's what you can change:\r\n\r\n* `8.8.8.8` -- change it to `1.1.1.1` in `AdGuardHome.yaml`\r\n* `176.103.133.60` -- you can disable \"browsing security\" and \"parental control\" in the settings, in this case, you won't need it.  Fixed: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/91ec996ffbd289798bab98ed426926f0b13a7b76  Hi! This is a timeout error while downloading the file. \r\n\r\nHow long does it take to download it using `wget` or `curl`? Got it, thank you! We'll increase the default timeout, it seems that currently it is less than 1 minute.  Done: #727   Hi! Marked as duplicate of #454 \r\n\r\nPlease vote for existing feature requests if you want us to implement them sooner.  Well, this requires using cosmetic filtering rules, and it is not possible on the DNS level.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we are planning to add a MITM proxy option to AGH, then it will become possible.  This is the first part of a whole set of client management settings we will need to implement.\n\nHere's what we should:\n\n1. Scan the /etc/hosts file\n2. If hostname is configured for the IP address, change how it looks like in the query log and in the \"Top Clients\" section: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_9luee_AdGuard_Home.png Done @tonyklawrence hm, maybe. Could you please file a feature request?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as a temporary solution you can copy/paste your hosts file contents to the AGH custom rules field.  > Couldn't start forwarding DNS server, cause: couldn't listen to UDP socket, cause: listen udp 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use\r\n\r\nHave you stopped AGH prior to updating & starting it?  Got it, thank you for the feature request!\r\n\r\nWhile we're considering it and waiting for people to vote on this feature request, there is a temporary solution, that would require some scripting on your side. You'll need to stop AGH, change the certificate in AdGuardHome.yml, and start AGH back. @via-justa that's awesome! I guess we should consider providing let's encrypt integration natively.  Could you please collect AGH logs (preferably, with verbose logging enabled)?  Tbh, it sounds like some kind of a recursion issue (AGH tries to resolve Cloudflare domain name through itself). What bootstrap DNS server do you have configured? > Oops, you are right. I do have 1.1.1.1 as the bootstrap DNS server, does this mean the bootstrap must be different to the Upstream DNS server\r\n\r\nWell, actually it should've worked just okay, what matters is that bootstrap DNS shouldn't be 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\nCould you please export logs just in case? We want to make a DOH upstream default so it might be important. > I've done it with verbose, but there is quite a bit of metadata.

Have you tried any other DOH server?  Sounds really unusual, I don't understand what can possibly cause all this:( As if something is preventing connecting to non-standard ports or smth like this. @planet0 yeah, I guess we can try that. Btw, have you been using the built-in DHCP in pi-hole and AGH?\r\n\r\n@szolin could you please try doing it? @planet0 btw, any idea where `Koala` postfix comes from in the DNS questions after the service restart?\r\n\r\n```\r\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;adguardteam.github.io.Koala.\tIN\t A\r\n``` Ah, nvm It'd interesting to check a couple more things:\r\n\r\n1. Try using `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query` as a DOH upstream\r\n2. After restart try this command to check connectivity to CF DNS: `openssl s_client -connect 104.16.112.25:443 -servername cloudflare-dns.com`. Make sure that this command is executed under the same user as AGH.\r\n3. Also, I'd like to see what you have in `/etc/resolv.conf` > to use the DNS port \r\n\r\nThe issue is valid for DOH only, right?\r\nIs it okay when you select a plain DNS upstream?\r\n\r\n> yet Pi-hole is able to load instantly\r\n\r\nWere you using it's own DHCP when testing? Do they both (AGH and Pi-Hole) work under the same user?\r\nIs it root? Seems to be some consequence of pi-hole installation, but I still can't understand what's that exactly.\r\n\r\nI do think it needs to be reported to pi-hole and not to cloudflared, they'll be as clueless as we are Hello!\r\n\r\nWhen AGH is installed as a service and DHCP server is enabled, the first run fails because network interface isn't set up yet.  So the system tries to restart the service after some time.\r\n\r\nAfter I've disabled DHCP server in my config, AGH starts quickly after reboot and there are no attempts by OS to restart the service, because it doesn't fail.\r\n\r\nHere's my log:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMar 28 14:43:08 raspberrypi AdGuardHome[347]: 2019/03/28 14:43:08 347#19 [info] Couldn't find IPv4 address of interface eth0 &{Index:2 MTU:1500 Name:eth0 HardwareAddr:b8:27:eb:40:2a:a2 Flags:up|broadcast|multicast}\r\nMar 28 14:43:08 raspberrypi AdGuardHome[347]: 2019/03/28 14:43:08 347#19 [fatal] Couldn't start DHCP server, cause: Couldn't find IPv4 address of interface eth0 &{Index:2 MTU:1500 Name:eth0 HardwareAddr:b8:27:eb:40:2a:a2 Flags:up|broadcast|multicast}\r\nMar 28 14:43:08 raspberrypi systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE\r\nMar 28 14:43:08 raspberrypi systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: Unit entered failed state.\r\nMar 28 14:43:08 raspberrypi systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.\r\nMar 28 14:45:16 raspberrypi systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: Service hold-off time over, scheduling restart.\r\n```\r\n\r\n@planet0 \r\nPlease run this command:\r\n\r\n`grep AdGuard /var/log/daemon.log`\r\n\r\nDo you see any lines similar to 'AdGuardHome.service: Service hold-off time over, scheduling restart.' ?\r\n  In the log file above there are 1228 attempted connections to 4 upstream servers from function AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext() - 4 connections per 1 DNS request, plus 16 times AGH tried to get an update for a filter.\r\n\r\n148 out of those 1228 requests failed with \"i/o timeout\" error after ~3 minutes.\r\nIt means that 1k requests are still pending (and their socket fd's are still opened) while they are waiting for network I/O.\r\n\r\nSo looking at this log I can only see that AGH simply can't reach the Internet servers - they all fail after timeout.\r\nI recommend using a network traffic sniffer like tcpdump or wireshark to ensure that those connection attempts are really delivered to the network interface.  And if they do, we need to check whether any packets from the upstream servers are delivered back to AGH.\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't know where the packets get stuck, so the first step is to find where this issue comes from. @planet0 @saltama I just stumbled upon this comment in the similar issue of CF repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/23#issuecomment-471933889\r\n\r\n> BUT after the connection is restored it still doesn't return DNS responses. I can fix it by pinging 1.0.0.1 (not restarting cloudflared) . This makes me suspect a lower layer issue - routing, perhaps?\r\n\r\nCould you please check if it helps to ping 1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1? > Should these be there in the first place? I mean, if we have another thread trying to make i/o to an unresponding address, should we open more? (also, shouldn't we have some limit?)\r\n\r\n@saltama well, yeah, but it will only fix one of the symptoms, it will not fix the root cause.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the i/o timeout issue you're experiencing is different from this one.\r\n\r\nThere are two different issues:\r\n\r\n1. No connection for the first 5 min after RPi reboot.\r\n2. i/o timeout errors that starting to appear after a few minutes of working without issues.\r\n\r\nWe tried updating our test RPi and installing the same packages, but still, we weren't able to reproduce it. So it seems we really need your help to figure what's wrong.\r\n\r\n@planet0 @saltama could you please collect tcpdump for us?\r\n\r\nHere's what needs to be done:\r\n1. Wait until the issue is reproduced.\r\n2. Run `tcpdump -i IFACE -w FILE.pcap` where IFACE is the name of the network interface, FILE is the dump filename.\r\n3. We'll need this file to analyze. Sure, np.\r\n\r\nBtw, as I recall, you can limit tcpdump to specific IP addresses so that there will be no risk in leaking anything private (communication with DOH/DOT is encrypted anyways). Glad to hear!  Could you please get AGH logs? > Technically not an issue with AdGuard Home, but could there be a way for AdGuard Home to automatically know if port 80 is already used and to offer overwriting or display what is currently using this port, like what netstat seems to do?\r\n\r\nWell, that's what we do during the initial configuration wizard -- AGH checks for port availability.\r\n\r\nHasn't it detected that port 80 is occupied in your case?  Merged into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/685  Duplicate of #454   You can change it in `AdGuardHome.yaml` already.\r\n\r\nSo do you mean that you'd like us to let you change these settings in the UI?  Could you please file two different feature requests? Yeah  @szolin relevant library:\r\nhttps://github.com/lpar/gzipped  Uh, really, thank you!  Well, I prefer the solution proposed in #594. The reason is simple - it's easy to forget about ignored queries, and then miss something really important. Marking this issue as duplicate.\r\n\r\nGuys, please vote for feature requests, that's how we understand what to do in the future.\r\n\r\n> The latter might be a good option for privacy\r\n\r\nWell, it's your own log, and I am not sure if hiding things from yourself has anything to do with privacy :)  We'll be able to print hostnames, there's a feature request for that: #438  @adrianh-za is this issue gone in v0.94 or is it still there?  Well, we anyway will migrate all the existing translations to Crowdin as well so if you use oneskyapp, it won't be lost. We want to migrate everything at once, and it makes the task pretty complicated, maybe in a couple of months we'll be finally able to do it. @MS-PC paging @aalpatkina she can do it. Could you please tell her your details? > I prefer not to give any details, for personal reasons. I only say that my translations are be reviewed and/or approved. Thanks.\r\n\r\nBy details I mean your username on oneskyapp so that she could grant you the proofreader/moderator role :) Her email is `aalpatkina at adguard.com` @aalpatkina please assist.\r\n\r\n@MS-PC Spanish language, right?  Currently, it does not work as `SetControlMessage` returns error on Windows.\n\nFirst of all, we should check if it's really necessary on Win. If it is, check if we can quickly add it: https://github.com/fancybits/go-net/commit/5fe812431d8781a65fd869990e7737ceb98d2221 I've subscribed to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7175, let's wait for them  The current implementation is the same as `fastest` from that list.\r\n\r\nTbh, I am not convinced that there should be a choice of different strategies. I'd prefer to have one that covers most of the use-cases. The question is whether `fastest` is better than other options or not.  Well, the UI is not our top priority at the moment, but we'll take this feature request into account once we start working on the final design.  @mveplus \r\n\r\nThank you! @IldarKamalov will take it from here.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the translation should've been added here: http://translate.adguard.com/collaboration/project?id=153384, and then we import it to the project in due course. Here is some more info on how AdGuard is translated: https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-translations\r\n\r\nHowever, once you've already made a pull request with the translated strings, we'll upload it to oneskyapp manually: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/615 Added in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/10fcfefcfd7220d68880cd735a3844ec4e617555, thank you!  @Zhijie327 thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n@aalpatkina and @IldarKamalov, please take care. Guys, any update on this? Can we download these new strings? Thank you so much!  Sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nI think we have a \"clear log\" feature request already.\r\nWhat for \"reboot\", why would you need it? It does restart the DNS server internally every time you change settings.\r\n\r\n  Do you mean that when you open the admin interface using the HTTP link, it is not getting redirected to HTTPS://adguardhomeadmin ? Well, I need a little bit more info about it.\r\n\r\nDo you use a domain name or an IP address in the HTTP link?\r\nIs the port 3000 open and reachable?\r\nDoes direct HTTPS link work? So just to make sure: do you use `http://domain:3000/` link? Good idea btw, so it might not work right after enabling HTTPS. We'll check it, thank you! @jimitsalvi Hi!\r\nI can't reproduce this issue. Have you faced this problem again? Thank you for the information!\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue for now, please reopen if it happens again, we'll look into it.  try either `c:/install/AdGuardHome` or `c:\\\\install\\\\AdGuardHome` Yeah, on Windows there's an issue with specifying an absolute path which we should fix.\r\n\r\nEven if you make it a valid YAML (by removing quotes or escaping `\\`) it won't work anyway:\r\n```\r\n2019/02/27 15:06:56 cannot create a log file: open c:\\AdGuardHome_v0.93_Windows\\\r\nc:\\adguard.log: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrec\r\nt.\r\n```  > Shortly after installing v0.93, enabling DOT, and adding some custom filters started seeing no memory left for system use.\r\n\r\nJust in case, what exact custom filters have you added?\r\nCould you share your AG config? Also, please show what you have in the output:\r\n`ps aux --sort -rss` @tomiams frankly, I think your issue is different.\r\n\r\n> My filters combine to around 1.2million rules\r\n\r\nI must admit that's A LOT. How many filters do you have installed? \r\n\r\nAre these filters public? Can you share your config file so that I could reproduce it on my side? Ah, got it, so it's huge filters in both cases after all.\r\n\r\nI think I know the reason, v0.93 loads filter from disk more often, and this might be the culprit. @tomiams on a side note:)\r\n\r\n`  bootstrap_dns: tls://1.1.1.1` -- currently, only plain DNS are supported here  Hm, have they finally added this option on a DNS level?\r\n\r\nIt's unclear from this thread if it was implemented or not:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/duckduckgo/comments/8qwzyl/feature_request_allow_network_operators_for_force/ Marking as duplicate of #268  Do you mean some custom hostname?\r\n\r\nFor now, you can add them in the filters settings using the hosts files syntax:\r\n`127.0.0.1 example.org`\r\n\r\nOr do you mean something else?  It does work actually. What client do you use? Well, I've just tested my AGH instance with FF and it works okay.\r\n\r\nHere's what you need to check:\r\n1. Check that you configured the bootstrap address (it's necessary): https://www.ghacks.net/2018/04/02/configure-dns-over-https-in-firefox/\r\n2. Check that you're using a valid certificate and FF trusts it. Yeah, the fact that bootstrap is mandatory is a bit confusing.  Using \"network service\" appears to be problematic in some configurations. We'd better simply use \"local system\".  Well, actually it will be relatively easy to implement as [dnsproxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy) already supports this behavior (see `--all-servers` there).  So you'd like to have some kind of a \"custom filter\"?\r\n\r\nIt'd be helpful if you can give us some examples of other projects with the same feature -- just for us to understand better how it can be implemented. Got it, thank you for the example!  @MS-PC do you have access to an x86 Windows PC?\r\n\r\nI can build it for you, but I need you to perform some quick test to see if it works okay. Here is the Win x86 binary:\r\n[AdGuardHome_v0.93-dirty_Windows_386.zip](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/2909504/AdGuardHome_v0.93-dirty_Windows_386.zip)\r\n @MS-PC huh, you had some issues according to the email notification with the original comment text.\r\n\r\nHave you been able to solve them all? > 1. I had a issue when working with the DNS server, specifically with the pre-defined DNS\r\n\r\nMost likely this is #500 \r\n\r\n> 2. I could not register the AdGuardHome.exe service according to the Wiki.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong? Great, thank you! We'll include x86 binaries in the next release then. Done  > Router (443) -> nginx stream (DNSCRYPT) > DNSCRYPT-Wrapper -> AGH -> Unbound = Running\r\n> Router (443 & /dns-query) -> nginx stream (DoH) > AGH -> Unbound = Running Not\r\n\r\nWell, I need to take a look at the nginx configuration file to figure what's wrong here. I am not an expert as well, but let's wait for @ezbiranik, maybe he can help What do you have on `dohproxy_backend`? Is it some DOH proxy? > Update, now i use for experimental\r\n\r\nWell, frankly, I'd suggest using [dnsproxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy). At least you can enable logging there and see what requests are coming in.\r\n\r\nOr simply use AGH directly:). Great:)    Hi, we haven't tested it on mips yet.\r\n\r\nCan you check if it works if I build it for you?\r\nDo you need mipsle or mips64le? Got it, thank you! I'll send you a binary after v0.93 is released Well, it seems as if you have go modules disabled.\r\n\r\nYou should `git clone` AdGuard to some place outside of your GOPATH and then run `make`\r\n Check `release.sh` to see how we build platform-specific binaries, that will give you the idea on how to build it for MIPS. Oh, please don't close it yet, I am interested in the result:)\r\n\r\nIf it works okay, we might add an official build as well. Just one important thing: MIPS is quite slow so I'd recommend changing upstream settings so that it used some regular plain DNS instead of the encrypted DNS-over-TLS that we have there by default. > It's high cpu usage, so, i back to dnscrypt-proxy.\r\n\r\nHave you changed the upstreams settings as I suggested here?\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/589#issuecomment-465573282\r\n\r\nYou see, DNS-over-TLS would be extremely slow on MIPS CPUs, hence the high cpu usage. Hi, here's a MIPS and MIPSLE binaries I've just built for you:\r\n\r\n[AdGuardHome_v0.93-dirty_linux_mips.tar.gz](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/2909507/AdGuardHome_v0.93-dirty_linux_mips.tar.gz)\r\n[AdGuardHome_v0.93-dirty_linux_mipsle.tar.gz](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/2909508/AdGuardHome_v0.93-dirty_linux_mipsle.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nWhen you run it for the first time, it will use plain DNS by default when MIPS is detected. Could you please try this?\r\n\r\n[AdGuardHome_v0.93-1-gbd31-dirty_linux_mipsle.tar.gz](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/2915667/AdGuardHome_v0.93-1-gbd31-dirty_linux_mipsle.tar.gz)\r\n @qokelate could you please create new issues for both feature requests?  I guess your VPS provider is hetzner as I recognize this type of notifications. They simply do not allow public DNS resolvers so the only viable solution would be to use another VPS provider (or maybe restrict the IP addresses you allow as @mveplus has suggested).\r\n\r\nAdGuard Home by default takes some anti-DNS-amplification measures:\r\n\r\n* Rate-limiter is set to 20 rps\r\n* ANY requests are disabled @ghoshorn just in case, I run my own private AG Home instances on Vultr and Digitalocean, and they never had any issues with it. Well, almost any public DNS resolver can be abused:\r\nhttp://openresolver.com/?ip=8.8.8.8\r\n\r\nThat's why we have strict rate limiting rules, and AGH has it even more stricter by default (~20 rps as I recall).  @hexeth the README is a bit inconsistent at the moment. It will be okay once we release v0.93 update. `latest` should be also okay now  Well, you might be under root already, try running it without sudo You're in the wrong directory, you need to be in the AdGuardHome directory.\r\n\r\nUse `ls -la` command to see what's inside the current directory.\r\nUse `cd ` command to switch to another directory (for instance, `cd AdGuard Home`). Also, about sudo, you shouldn't use colon there, just `sudo ./AdGuardHome`  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1. Run AG Home with the built-in DHCP server\r\n2. Connect to this network from the device 1 (it'll receive the first IP from the configured range)\r\n3. Restart AG Home (the leases table will be cleared)\r\n4. Connect to this network from the device 2\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nDevice 2 receives the next IP from the configured range\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe DHCP server is not aware of the current leases so it will return the same IP that was used for the device 1.  @tuapuikia is it a default nginx configuration? Does it also disable `DELETE` method?\r\n\r\nWe might consider switching everything to `POST` if so  Thank you!\r\n\r\nYeah, makes sense to do it as a part of #454.\r\n  Confirmed, thank you!  What upstream do you have configured in AG Home?\r\n\r\nFrom the description, it reminds me of the bug with handling truncated responses which was fixed in dnsproxy already: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/commit/c26e194b68e47724a7dd08d057737a222fb567d8\r\n\r\nIt'd be better to check it again once we updated the dnsproxy dependency in AG Home. Thank you! What other settings do you have in AdGuard?\r\nSafe search, filter lists, etc?\r\n\r\nDisabling protection makes AdGuard just bypass the DNS queries directly to the upstream.  Questions:\r\n\r\n1. What upstream do you have configured in AdGuardHome? Is there any change when you use a different upstream?\r\n2. Do you see this or related DNS requests in the query log?\r\n3. Try running AG Home with `-v` argument, maybe there will be something useful in the verbose log.\r\n\r\n> Linux adguardhole\r\n\r\nLol \ud83d\ude04   Well, usually it is possible to configure multiple DNS servers in the router DHCP settings. However, one of them will be the primary server, and it will be used most of the time anyway.  @be2clack \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e?\r\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/304050/how-to-avoid-conflicts-between-dnsmasq-and-systemd-resolved  thanks! Will investigate.\r\n\r\nJust in case -- what hardware and OS is that? Thank you. Is there anything common for those clients that have wonky IP's? Hardware? OS? Wifi? Ethernet? @Threefish1024 not yet, debugging DHCP is painful:( We'll try to solve it quickly, v0.94 release won't take as much time as v0.93.\r\n\r\nWhat you describe is most likely due to this bug: #584  @planet0 \r\nCan you enable verbose logging so we can see what's going on with the lease table?\r\nIn your `AdGuardHome.yaml` set `verbose true`.\r\n\r\nAnd then the log will contain info about the current state of leases table, e.g.:\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dhcpd.(*Server).ServeDHCP(): Leases:\r\ngithub.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dhcpd.(*Server).ServeDHCP(): Lease #0: hwaddr 08:00:27:56:2c:6c, ip 192.169.56.2, expiry 0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's see whether it prints correct IP addresses.  > 2 info using npm@3.10.10\r\n> 3 info using node@v6.14.3\r\n\r\nNewer npm/node versions are required to build it. Yeah, it makes sense:) @IldarKamalov let's specify LTS as the minimum supported version, we don't test it with older versions anyway  I cannot reproduce it on my side. Could you please take a look at the Query Log of AG Home and try to figure blocking of which domain is causing it?\r\n\r\nAlso, what filters subscriptions do you have enabled? @KammAndRe screenshots weren't attached to the message, you need to upload them here on Github  It seems something is wrong there:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/546#issuecomment-453898421  Regular expressions are supported, you can add something like this to the custom filtering rules to test it: `/example/`\r\n\r\n@IldarKamalov add this example to the \"Custom filtering rules\" settings:\r\n`/REGEX/ - block access to the domains matching the specified regular expression`  Here's the thread that gave me this idea:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/issues/7\r\n\r\nIf `/32` (IPv4) or `/128` (IPv6) address is specified in the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDNS_Client_Subnet) extension, we might want to use it instead of client address in the query log and stats modules.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we will be able to chain DNS queries keeping information about the actual client. For instance, from a local AdGuard Home or `dnsproxy` to a remote AdGuard Home instance located on a VPS.   I guess this should be marked as a duplicate of #714   Could you please give me some examples of what you are trying to achieve, I don't quite understand the question.\r\n\r\nAG Home will listen to `::1` (both IPv4 and IPv6) by default.\r\nCloudflare IPv6 is an upstream. If your device can connect to it, it will work okay. It does not matter whether you use IPv6 or IPv4 stamp, the DNS responses will be the same. > How are ipv6 queries getting from the laptop to Adguard Home with out a local ipv6.\r\n\r\nYour laptop may, in theory, use an IPv6 server if it is provided by your ISP (and if you're in an IPv6-enabled network). In this case, your AdGuard Home device will likely have an IPv6 address as well which you'll be able to use as a DNS server.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to simply disable IPv6 in your laptop Wi-Fi settings. > Just one more question i'm assuming i would use a ipv6 upstream with adguard home for the IPv6 enabled devices.\r\n\r\nYou can of course, but to be honest, it makes little sense. Regardless of the resolver type, the answers will be the same so it's simply safer to use IPv4 everywhere.  It does cache requests, yes. That sounds like a good idea, thanks! No promises when and if it's gonna be implemented. @thb007 I guess that's what this feature request is about  Please make a new clean pull request without unrelated changes in commit history.  Sounds like a good idea. Thank you for submitting this.   Yes, it should work. We didn't test Asus Tinker Board S specifically, but since it's an ARM processor with Linux, there shouldn't be anything stopping it from working. Just download an ARM binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/latest) and run it.  What browser is it? (specify the browser version please) Tbh, I think our web interface simply does not work with the browsers so old.\r\n\r\n@IldarKamalov can enlighten us on what are the minimum browser versions it supports. > So, I thought I'd put my old Mac Mini to use but only got so far\r\n\r\nYou can open the admin panel from your normal computer (use the old Mac Mini address to do that). Also, you will anyway need to configure the DNS address in your router settings.\r\n\r\nYou see, AG Home is basically a DNS server, it won't do anything automatically.\r\n\r\n> Finally, I was able to add AdGuard on my router but I still see ads all over the place\r\n\r\nExecute this command in the terminal of your main computer: `nslookup ad.doubleclick.net`\r\n\r\nIf your devices are configured properly, you'll see smth like this: `** server can't find ad.doubleclick.net: NXDOMAIN` > However, even though my devices on the network reflect the AdGuard DNS entries, I still get ads like there's no protection. Any idea why this would not work?\r\n\r\nYou need to make sure (somehow) that they really use AG Home. Try opening `ad.doubleclick.net` in the browser, if it is not blocked - something is not okay and they don't use it.  We explained it in the v0.92 release notes:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.92\r\n\r\nBriefly, here's the rationale behind that:\r\n\r\n1. The DNS server is supposed to be a mere part of AdGuard Home. It is the main part at the moment, but it won't be like that forever.\r\n2. If we had continued to use CoreDNS, we would have had to build everything around CoreDNS. It's just CoreDNS is supposed to be the center of a program, and it's hard to embed it.  I think you need to change `192.168.2.25\tpi2 cctv cctv.fritz.box` to:\r\n```\r\n192.168.2.25\tpi2\r\n192.168.2.25\tcctv\r\n192.168.2.25\tcctv.fritz.box\r\n``` Filed a new bug report:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/735\r\n\r\nI suppose this is the root cause.  ```\r\n2019/01/14 03:25:55 Failed to update filter http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt: Get http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt: dial tcp: lookup www.malwaredomainlist.com on [fd00::e228:6dff:fe29:977b]:53: read udp [2003:e3:9f15:7300:d010:e86d:53d0:446f]:52891->[fd00::e228:6dff:fe29:977b]:53: i/o timeout\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the DNS settings of your device, it seems that it is configured to use an invalid DNS server. I am not talking about the DNS servers you have configured in AG Home, I am talking about your device's DNS settings which are different: \r\n`2019/01/14 03:25:55 Failed to update filter http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt: Get http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt: dial tcp: lookup www.malwaredomainlist.com on [fd00::e228:6dff:fe29:977b]:53: read udp [2003:e3:9f15:7300:d010:e86d:53d0:446f]:52891->[fd00::e228:6dff:fe29:977b]:53: i/o timeout` `fd00::e228:6dff:fe29:977b` this one seems to mailfunction. pinging != dns lookup @Bluscream do you still have this issue on v0.95? AGH now uses itself as a DNS resolver for all queries, so in theory, it should've gone away.\r\n\r\nCould you please post a new log file?  First of all, please check what API is available:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/tree/master/openapi\r\n\r\nIf there's something you'd like to be added, please post a comment here with the details on what you'd like to have there and why you need it. @rothgar there's already a feature request for that: #516   You need to add `||il.com^` if you want to block `il.com` and its subdomains Hi!\r\n\r\nAdGuard filter rules follow the standard ad blocking syntax, described [here](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters), [here](https://adblockplus.org/filters) and [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax). We have simplified the syntax and removed features that make no sense in dns context, but essentially we are matching hostnames instead of full urls against the filters. \r\n\r\nSince standard ad blocking syntax defines that wildcard matching in the beginning and end is done by default, you want an anchor at the beginning `||` and end `^`. \r\n\r\nWe also support [hosts format matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)), but you will need to fix your rules by adding an IP address at the beginning of a line. As I recall, the malwaredomains provides `justdomains` list, and there's also firebog.net. Maybe you're right and it makes sense to handle the case of a simple domain name matching. \r\n\r\nI guess we could detect that the line looks like a domain name and automatically prepend `||` to it.\r\n\r\nReopening this issue as a feature request, we'll discuss it a bit later then. No prob, these lines will be discarded.  This is likely to be a duplicate of #521 \r\n\r\nIt'd be great if you can build AG Home from `fix/521` branch and verify it @alexruf @planet0 thank you so much guys!  What did it print to the stdout when it was starting up? I mean could it be that when you first started it, there was no DNS available and that's why it failed to download the filter contents? The problem with 1.1.1.1, in general, is that it is unavailable from some locations due to the history of the IP address. For instance, @hmage home ISP blocks it for some unknown reason. The second problem is that you can't change bootstrap DNS via the web admin interface, so we had to choose the most reliable DNS.\r\n\r\nWe can change the default to `1.1.1.1` or `176.103.130.130` once we expose the bootstrap DNS in the settings UI.  > Looks like the default query_type is ANY which AGH doesn't seem to implement?\r\n\r\nIt's an anti-DNS-amplification measure. You can override it in the AGH config file (look for `refuse_any` there).\r\n\r\nNote that it won't work if cloudflare DNS is set as an upstream as it also refuses ANY requests.  > stopcode: DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION\r\n\r\nThis code indicates that the problem is inside one of your kernel drivers, the operation inside it took too much time. So I guess AG Home could somehow trigger it, but it's not the real cause.\r\n\r\nCan you find the minidump? It'd be better to reproduce it and collect a new minidump\r\n The crash happens in GlassWire network driver:\r\nhttp://www.osronline.com/dump/DA2.cfm\r\n\r\nDPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION means that some operation there took more time than it is allowed.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be reported to GlassWire. @lancelot-moon here's a nice online tool for minidumps analysis:\r\nhttp://www.osronline.com/page.cfm?name=Analyze\r\n\r\nThe crash is caused by glasswire again. > AG Home never caused\r\n\r\nAG Home never caused or cause any crashes simply because it cannot. \r\n\r\nIt works in \"user\" space and the cause of a BSOD is always something (a driver) working in \"kernel\" space. @lancelot-moon yeah, that's your dump:\r\nhttp://www.osronline.com/dump/DA2.cfm\r\n\r\nScroll down to the end of the stack trace, you'll find `gwdrv` there, that's glasswire driver.  ```\r\ntls://101.101.101.101\r\nhttps://dns.twnic.tw/dns-query\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these work okay  AG Home validates the `content-type` response header and checks that it starts with `text/plain`\r\n\r\nThis header is missing in this case so that's why. In order to fix this issue, we'll have to come up with another way of checking the filter list content.  @mquarneti thank you for the contribution!\r\n\r\nI've assigned this PR to the \"Docker image\" milestone. We're going to sort out all the docker-related issues later this month.  Hi!\r\n\r\nCan you post the configuration file? I'm interested whether you changed the ratelimit settings.\r\n\r\nTaking a guess, I think this is because you ran out of vCPU credits (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-credits-baseline-concepts.html). Can you make sure this isn't the case?\r\n\r\nAlso try running `time dig google.com @your.machine.ip.address`. When a DOT upstream is under load, it operates on open connections so things go fast.\r\nWhen night comes and there is no more activity, every new DNS request requires establishing a new TLS connection, it has to go through TLS handshake every time, and this slows things down considerably.\r\n\r\nJust in case, try using a plain DNS upstream instead, do you see any difference? @jimitsalvi it'd help if AGH was running with `-v` argument so that we could see what takes so long in the stdout. Hm, on the other hand, we'd better extend the verbose logging before proceeding. In the current implementation, we won't see how much time does every operation take.\r\n\r\nWe should get back to this issue once https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/531 is done. > Is there some implementation where we could see the RTT downstream from the ADG to clients?\r\n\r\nIt's unclear how much we spend inside `dnsfilter` (we need #531 for that)\r\nAlso, you can check `ping` values to your server to see what's the network's overhead. @dany20mh we already have that info in querylog -- click 'download log' in querylog page and then use json parser to show only long queries Sorry for the huge delay, guys.\r\n\r\nWe've just pushed the new release with extended logging which should be enough to figure if there's any issue: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.93\r\n\r\nAlso, it uses a newer version of `dnsproxy` under the hood that might also help. Interesting, and in my case avg time dropped to about 15ms. You know, the log seems more or less okay.\r\n\r\nThere are 765 requests in the log, the avg processing time of them is 110ms.\r\nThere were five slow requests (2159ms, 3221ms, 7408ms, 11093ms, 16272ms), if you don't count them, the avg time would be around 57ms.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I forgot to ask -- do you have \"malware protection\" or \"parental control\" services enabled. They both use a remote web service, and might slow things down. > I do have \"Use AdGuard browsing security web service\" enabled\r\n\r\nUh, we should add it's timing to the log as well, I don't know why we ignored it:(\r\n\r\n@admitrevskiy could you please extend logging of the dnsFilter module? We just released v0.94 and added more logging there, I think now we'll be able to figure what's wrong with the browsing security/parental control web services. @admitrevskiy plz check the logs. 300ms might be okay, but the local cache should help with it, and following queries should be fast. Yeah, so the initial lookup is so slow that even with the cache, it hurts the average time.\r\n\r\nSo our options are:\r\n1. Make it faster, deploy more servers, etc. Problem: this is expensive.\r\n2. Start using AG DNS to do these checks (AG DNS is deployed all over the world so it will be much faster). Problem: instead of using the nice privacy-oriented algorithm based on hashes prefixes, we'll need to query the domain name.\r\n\r\nTbh, I like the second option more. > I'm guessing then that entries that show 0ms are cached responses?\r\n\r\nYes, you're right. For example for hub2.corp.adobe.com\r\n\r\n2019/03/23 14:20:54 4032#40 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).checkSafeBrowsing(): SafeBrowsing HTTP lookup for hub2.corp.adobe.com; Elapsed time: 331ms\r\n\r\nThe next time you were looking for this host the following log message appeared:\r\n\r\n2019/03/23 14:21:02 4032#85 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).lookupCommon(): hub2.corp.adobe.com: found in the lookup cache\r\n2019/03/23 14:21:02 4032#85 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/dnsfilter.(*Dnsfilter).checkSafeBrowsing(): SafeBrowsing HTTP lookup for hub2.corp.adobe.com; Elapsed time: 0ms\r\n Reassigned to v0.96, the task is too complicated:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/525#issuecomment-476374978\r\n\r\nPriority is set to medium because both of these options are disabled by default.  I am quite sure this is actually a duplicate of #520  Could you please run AG Home with `-v` argument and capture the verbose output? I'd like to see what's wrong there. One more thing, does it work okay if you specify `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query` ? Anyways, if you run AGH like this `AdGuardHome.exe -v` it will print verbose log to the stdout. It's interesting to see what's printed there when something begins to misbehave. Yeah, I see what's going on, thank you!\r\n\r\nThe response over UDP is truncated and to get the proper response, we should retry over TCP:\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup www.youtube.com 10.7.113.140\r\n;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.\r\n;; Connection to 10.7.113.140#53(10.7.113.140) for www.youtube.com failed: connection refused.\r\n``` @hmage the issue is resolved in dnsproxy v0.9.11: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/releases/tag/v0.9.11 Fixed  Thank you for the questions! We'll discuss it once I am back from vacations at the end of January, and see what we're going to do.  > Is it possible to add multiple filter lists at once?\r\n\r\nFor now, you can simply edit the AdGuardHome.yaml configuration file and add them all there.  Could you please run AG Home with -v argument and collect the verbose log? @alexruf hi! I've received your log, thank you!\r\n\r\nJust in case, do you have `go` installed? Can you build a test version of AG Home if I make some changes in a branch? Awesome, I'll get back with instructions then.\r\n\r\nAlso, it'd be easier to experiment with https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy and not AG Home, that's what works under the hood of AG Home anyway. Ah, one more thing, it makes sense to build and run `dnsproxy` right away and see if there's any issue with this configuration:\r\n`./dnsproxy -u tls://1.1.1.1 -v`\r\n\r\nIn this case `dnsproxy` will run with disabled cache and that might be important for this issue Thanks to @alexruf I can now compare logs from `dnsproxy` and `AGH`.\r\n\r\nThere's one interesting detail about it, some of the DNS requests came to `dnsproxy` over `TCP`, and the difference is that AGH does not listen to TCP! That might be important. @alexruf could you please build AGH from this branch and see how it goes?\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/tree/fix/521\r\n\r\nTo build AGH you'll need `go v1.11` and `node v10+` (and `npm v6+`).\r\n\r\nIt's explained here how to build it:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#prerequisites\r\n\r\n@ibksturm as I understand you've got some issues with Netflix as well. Could you please check if you still experience it with v0.92-hotfix1?\r\n Make sure that you clone the repo *not* to gopath\r\n\r\nYou need osx binary? I guess I can build it for you later when I am at the laptop. @alexruf thanks for checking it! @zeus10000 hm, this must be something else, the DNS server currently listens to TCP.\r\n\r\nCould you please enable `verbose` logging and check what's there?  Fixed by https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/ddcfe7c4bf2ac93b965e79e4652d945dd3f47713  > Mutable data like this should well umm go to somewhere mutable like the /data volume?\r\n\r\nYep, that makes sense indeed. > It seems the `last-updated` timestamp of each filter source is stored in teh config file\r\n\r\nResolved in v0.93 btw.\r\n  I've collected all the Docker-related issues and questions in a separate milestone, we'll discuss it with the team once I am back from vacations (~20th of Jan).\r\n\r\nThe current plan is to publish a hotfix release with some major bugs of v0.92 fixed asap: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/milestone/7\r\n\r\nThen we should get back to what's planned on [v0.93](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/milestone/4). Maybe we'll be able to squeeze the Docker-related issues somewhere in between. Well, we've not done multi-stage builds, but we now have the official image that is updated automatically on every new commit to `master` (`edge` tag on Docker Hub), I hope it's enough:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/tag/v0.93  https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/514#issuecomment-467088012  > Does AdGuardHome also have a built-in DHCP server? I notice this in the source code but not seeing any mention of it anywhere else. If so; what is the intended use-cases for this?\r\n\r\nIt does, scroll the settings screen down a bit:)\r\n\r\nThe use case is to run a DHCP server that will define AG Home as the default DNS server for the network.\r\n\r\n> 2) -- Looks like on startup a AdGuardHome.yaml config is generated and seems to use this remote file as it's DNs filter list: https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt\r\n\r\nDepending on what filters are configured, it downloads them on the first startup.\r\n  Marked as duplicate of #505   Check it out here:\r\nhttps://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/issues/66#issuecomment-256740509  Thank you, much better!  This will be easy to solve when #490 is ready  It happens when the tcp connection to the upstream is closed after some time. @hmage I guess we should re-connect automatically right away. Temporary solution: use a DNSCrypt, DOH, or plain DNS upstream. @Vansinnet could you please attach a debug output? Run AG with `-v` Nah, just run the binary directly:\r\n`./AdGuardHome -v`\r\n\r\nAG Home will print the verbose log to the output @Vansinnet yeah that's another bug (with Cloudflare upstream): https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/520 Reopening, this issue will be marked as fixed when we start using the newer dnsproxy version Fixed by https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/ddcfe7c4bf2ac93b965e79e4652d945dd3f47713 @prologic I guess the idea is to help the wife to find a better show by not deploying any fixes :)  Could it be Chrome's DNS cache messing things up?\r\n\r\nI am quite sure `pornhub.com` is resolved to a blocking page when parental control service is enabled.  Hi!\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a bug, thanks for reporting!  Duplicates #490   Please run `AdGuardHome.exe -v` so that it printed the debug output and show what's there.\r\n\r\nAlso, could you please look hover the `(?)` icon to see what rule/filter blocks the request? Yeah, for some reason it fails to establish an encrypted connection with Cloudflare:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/issues/2 I can't reproduce it on my Windows VM though, that's weird What if you use some other upstreams?\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n```\r\ntls://one.one.one.one\r\ntls://dns.adguard.com\r\n``` I must say this is super-weird:) You're on `Windows Server 2012 R2` right? Got it, thank you! We'll try to reproduce it on this Windows version then. It might be a known golang bug, though. This is very likely because your ISP blocks packets to 1.1.1.1.\r\n\r\nYou can confirm this by running `ping 1.1.1.1`. You should be getting ping replies but if your ISP blocks, you won't get any.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case, please contact your ISP to fix routing to 1.1.1.1.\r\n\r\nYou will also be unable to open https://1.1.1.1 in your browser as well, regardless of AdGuardHome running or not.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Using cloudflare dns by hostname works because every hostname resolves to both 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1. Your ISP doesn't block 1.0.0.1 so it gets chosen. Alright. My apologies for jumping to conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt really does seem like a bug that can be fixed. This is a bug of golang and there's no easy way to fix it from our side. @admitrevskiy has filed it to golang repo: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30985  Make sure that you unpacked it properly, from the error it looks as if you have a text file by that path Yep, that's right, since we dropped CoreDNS the overall size is less now.\r\n\r\nI've just re-checked it on my side and everything seems okay:\r\n```\r\nwget https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/download/v0.92/AdGuardHome_v0.92_linux_amd64.tar.gz\r\ntar xvfz AdGuardHome_v0.92_linux_amd64.tar.gz\r\ncd AdGuardHome\r\n./AdGuardHome\r\n``` Try looking inside:\r\n```\r\ncat /mnt/d/Applications/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome | more\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt definitely does not think it's a binary file. Btw have you tried the Windows binary already? Let's wait for @hmage maybe he has any thoughts on the matter Make sure you're running the binary for correct architecture.\r\n\r\nPlease type this:\r\n`uname -a`\r\nand\r\n`file /mnt/d/Applications/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome`\r\n\r\nthe architectures must match.  Hi!\r\n\r\nThis command will fail on >50% of users, because of these problems:\r\n\r\n * This will work only on Linux \u2014 setcap doesn't exist on FreeBSD, Darwin or Windows. \r\n * On Linux it requires `setcap` to be installed \u2014 the package names are different on different flavours of Linux. For example, on CentOS it's `libcap`, on OpenSUSE it's `libcap-progs` but on Debian it's `libcap2-bin`, and it's not installed by default on half of distros.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to keep the readme simple for big majority of users so they can follow it without requiring extra help or knowledge. Using setcap can be documented in the wiki -- you are welcome to add a page about it there.  After implementing #423, we need to polish it, since right now go's cross-platform standard library doesn't support or provide a way to distinguish from which interface the packet has came from on Windows.  DNS-level blocking is not that flexible, you cannot unblock ads on a single website.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is figure which domain breaks the website, and unblock that domain in your user filter. Try using dev tools on your desktop computer and see what domains are blocked, then try unblocking them one by one.  That's a good bug, AG Home mustn't be broken by invalid rules [EDIT]: ignore this comment Next release will have this issue fixed. We've moved off coredns-based system. Resolved in the master branch.  I guess first of all we should write a log file, right?  User rules list is supposed to be short, that's why we simply keep it in the main config. You can add a custom filter if you want to have smth huge?  Hi!\r\n\r\nThe most likely problem -- everything gets stuck at resolving host because they only try port 53, if you can find a way to tell the software on your other computers to use different port, you can run without root.\r\n\r\nAnother way if you don't want to use root but still use port 53 is possible on Linux (and Solus OS is Linux), you can do this:\r\n```\r\nsudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep <path_to_AdGuardHome>\r\n```\r\nReplace `path_to_AdGuardHome` with path to AdGuardHome binary, afterwards, it will be able to bind to port 53 without requiring root.  https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/pull/1  We can backport this for instance:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/blob/master/proxy/proxy.go#L192  The problem with this is that this is a TTL of a DNS client cache, we can't do anything from the server side with it.  @IldarKamalov please do, the fix is trivial   @tomiams thank you so much, this is an awesome instruction!   Source: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/480\r\n\r\n> On the \"Query Log\" page, it would be great to be able to specify a time range, e.g. show only queries from 11:48:00 to 11:49:00\r\n> Also, when I want to see more rows of data and select \"100 rows\" on the bottom of the screen, it would be great if AdGuard would remember that choice.\r\n\r\n  > Is there any reasons that tls://1.1.1.1 is not working?\r\n\r\nHappens with Cloudflare DNS sometimes.\r\n\r\nTo check if it works from your location try smth like that: `nslookup example.org 1.1.1.1`\r\n\r\n> Does AdGuardHome produce a log of the communications/errors with the upstream DNS servers?\r\n\r\nIt prints more info to stdout.\r\n\r\n> Don't they share a similar database of malware domains?\r\n\r\nNo, AdGuard's database is much larger and that's why it is a web service, it's too heavy to be downloaded.\r\n\r\n> On the \"Query Log\" page, it would be great to be able to specify a time range\r\n\r\nMakes sense, thank you! I've created a separate feature request for that: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/481  Yep, that's a bug indeed, thank you!  Hi!\r\n\r\nMy first thought is that probably `client/node_modules` got interrupted and on second run it fails -- happened to me before. \r\n\r\nUntil I can get ahold of a dev who does js, try this: `make clean && make`, it'll nuke `client/node_modules` and npm will try from fresh.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, let me know.  @BaldEagleX02 what's the exact hostname just in case? We'll try reproducing it on our end. Chrome? It might be caching old DNS records, try clearing its own cache:\r\nchrome://net-internals/#dns @BaldEagleX02 \r\n> Hoverer before I had changed the rules it was returning 127.0.0.1. Why?\r\n\r\nIs it possible that you had the same hostname listed in custom rules or additional hosts-format filters that you've added in the settings?\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting the issue either way ^.^  @IldarKamalov plz We're trying to avoid HTML in the strings when it's possible. Please check how it looks in v0.92 (we'll publish it soon) and re-open this or file a new issue if you think it's not okay.  That's actually a good idea, thanks!\r\n\r\nAfter we do #450, we will have access to such data and it will be easy to implement.  What binary did you download? arm? arm64? amd64? i386? Can you try to run it from the terminal instead of systemd?\r\n\r\nJust run it from terminal:\r\n```\r\ncd $HOME/AdGuardHome\r\nsudo ./AdGuardHome\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd show us what it says.\r\n\r\nThat would be greatly appreciated to figure out what's going on. What are the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf`? Is it 127.0.0.1? Breaking commit is 32d4e80c93cba5b3ef4bb96c79f7256b5cb4d913 -- it tries to use DNS _before_ the dns server is up. As a workaround, please change /etc/resolv.conf to point to another server, for example 8.8.8.8 > Seems to only happen on first run/install?\r\n\r\nYep, that's right.\r\n\r\n Resolved in the master branch  > and issue in /#logs when you load external filters and block them, you cannot load anymore this page:\r\n\r\nCould you please provide some exact steps to reproduce this?  How are you launching adguard home? \r\n\r\nIf systemd, could you please provide systemd logs? `journalctl -a > log` and attach the log file to the issue. It was likely a race condition, try building from source newest master and see if the problem still remains. Yep, managed to reproduce the issue. The latest commit 45ae984f3bd7bad1f21c1e8f9910558cc2986cba fixes the issue.  Issue moved to [AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter #23](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/issues/23) via [**ZenHub**](https://www.zenhub.com/)\n  Hi.\r\n\r\nWhat Linux distribution are you using? Debian? Ubuntu? Do you have any linux kernel security installed and activated like SElinux, AppArmor, GrSecurity, SecComp or something similar? @apeng2012 could you please try building AG from the master branch? There were some massive changes lately and it might help @ultimatevn what exact error do you see in the AGH console output?\r\n\r\nAre you running AGH under root? @ultimatevn could you please share your AdGuardHome.yaml?\r\n\r\nTry changing DNS interface from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 for instance.  @marcotuna \r\nYeah, well, this is what we have in mind. Thank you for suggesting Cloudflare as an example, their DNS panel is very nice indeed.  This rule should prevent blocking `googleadapis.l.google.com` (which is a CNAME for `fonts.googleapis.com`), but for some reason, it does not work:\r\n`@@||googleadapis.l.google.com^|` Correct rule is `@@||googleadapis.l.google.com^`, without the `|` in the end. Both are correct  Do you mean an upstream proxy, right? This proxy is supposed to be used when AG downloads filters updates, right?\r\n\r\nI am not sure using it for anything else would be viable @tomiams got it. Makes sense indeed @tomiams  While you wait for the GUI, you can already use upstream HTTP proxy by setting the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable for AdGuardHome:\r\n```\r\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.lan:3128/\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, if there's username and password:\r\n```\r\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@proxy.lan:3128/\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou need to put this environment setting accordingly depending on how you launch AdGuardHome.  What you want will be possible when we implement #445  @TheHasagi plz take care and add to the blacklist @adreporter01 it'd be better to send them directly to `st@adguard.com` then -- just not to fill the GH repo with NSFW links :) I'd better not to just to avoid false positives. The same thing with porn, for instance, 1% of false positives would be a problem.  How can we split lookups by IP when we don't know the IP addresses before doing the actual lookup?\r\n\r\n> The second way is to maintain a list of domains of which you want to resolve from local DNS or foreign DNS. This list changes too often, taking too much effort to maintain.\r\n\r\nIs this the main idea? In this case this is a duplicate of #445  Hm, I was almost sure that I've already created this task, but it appears I have not.\r\n\r\nThank you, we'll do it for sure! @rapdodge this one is not yet assigned to any milestone. We'll be reviewing all the popular feature requests after v0.95 update. @szolin \r\n\r\nFor starters, let's make `safeBrowsingBlockHost` and `parentalBlockHost` configurable -- add them to the `yaml` configuration file.  Actually, AG Home stores log for 24 hours but shows only last 5k records in the dashboard UI.\r\n\r\nThe easy solution would be to make \"Download log file\" return the whole log and not just 5k records. > Also, restarting AdGuardHome should not reset the statistics as is currently the case.\r\n\r\nHm, it actually does not reset stats (it's calculated on the AG Home startup using the current query log for the last 24h).  Safe-search enforced requests were cached on 176.103.130.132/4, this will be resolved shortly, thank you for letting us know!  >  Automatic Check for new version\r\n> Update notifications within the webinterface (and maybe even within connected AG clients)\r\n\r\nThese are done already What's `configurable auto-update` though?  > When you have the \"silent auto-update\" setting enabled it just does the update process in the background and restarts itself everytime a new update was found.\r\n\r\nSilent auto-update should be a separate feature request, that's for sure  Yeah, thx\r\n\r\nDuplicate of #285   @Bluscream upvote the feature request to make it sooner. We choose from the most upvoted.  Makes sense, thank you! @darookee we're going to drop `forward` plugin soon and replace it with our own simple plugin (which will support DoH and DNSCrypt). `forward` is awesome for servers under heavy load, but it limits us in AdGuard Home. Done https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/5b417d9f17e0074dc51a5ff5cf0e6aa6dadff512  Yeah, looks like a duplicate of #395 \r\n\r\nWe should handle it automatically as a part of #425   Uh, that's a huge PR, thank you!\r\n\r\nTbh, we wanted to finalize the dashboard UI first, and add translations a bit later after that. We will reuse this PR partly when it's time: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/442 I see you're supporting this PR, thank you for that!\r\n\r\nIn order for this PR to be merged, there's a few changes that need to be done:\r\n\r\n1. Base language (English) strings need to be added as a separate file: `client/src/__locales/en.js`\r\n2. Every string should have an identifier, e.g. `Blocked malware/phishing` -> `stat_blocked_malware`\r\n3. In the JS files, we should use these identifiers instead of plain English strings\r\n\r\nThe reason for this change is translation automation via adguard.oneskyapp.com or crowdin. If we don't do it and keep using the current approach, every change to the base language will basically add a new string for translation instead of changing the existing one. @IldarKamalov please review and also check out this task: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/442#issuecomment-437709171  Not really :(\r\n\r\nYou need at least 50MB (better 100MB) free space prior to installing AG Home.  First of all, we need to figure out the MAC address corresponding to the IP address.\r\n\r\nThere are several options.\r\n\r\n1. Automatic: in case if AG Home operates as a DHCP server (#423), this is quite easy;\r\n2. Automatic: inspecting ARP cache (`arp -a`);\r\n3. Semi-automatic: using hostnames\r\n4. Manual: Allow configuring mapping in the UI;\r\n\r\nSecond, we need to have a separate settings screen specifically for inspecting known clients & editing their properties. Added hostnames to the list of options, thank you!\r\n @AnthonyBe we're going to implement all 4 options, not just one of them. Guys, no ETA on this yet. I've preliminarily assigned it to milestone 0.93 to emphasize that improving this part of AG Home is one of the most important feature requests, but most likely I'll divide it into several tasks or even create a new milestone dedicated to \"Client management\". You see, it's not just about assigning names. In the future, AGH should let you have different (to some extent) client-specific configurations. First part of this issue will be ready in v0.94 -- using hosts files: #637 \r\n\r\nBut that's not the end, we'll extend it later in v0.95. @rashidjehangir could you please explain where exactly have you added them? Is it the local hosts file? Have you restarted AGH after doing that?\r\n\r\n> The system cannot find the file specified\r\n\r\nWhere does this error come from? Can you please share the AGH log? @rashidjehangir you know, there's a simpler solution, open `http://AGH_ADDRESS/control/clients` URL and check if your IP address is listed there @rashidjehangir check that you didn't forget the port  @rashidjehangir what OS are you on? What's the exact path to the hosts file? @rashidjehangir got it, thank you! Is it 32-bit or 64-bit Windows?\r\n\r\n@szolin could you please check it on a Windows machine? > Another question - do I use a space or a TAB between IP Address and friendly name?\r\n\r\nBoth are okay, It shouldn't matter That's why we're not closing this issue yet:)  So here's what is requested:\r\n\r\n1. General settings (browsing security / safe search / parental control) per client\r\n2. Different filters per client\r\n3. Different DNS servers per client\r\n\r\nNumber 1 is relatively easy. 2 and 3 are quite harder, though. Number 1 is done: #727   The query log shows that that particular request was blocked indeed. But the new requests to that domain will not be blocked. @magnu5 thank you!\r\n\r\nYeah, that's a duplicate of #383, sorry for me being so slow to realize that.  After #425 is done, you'll be able to select a proper net interface during the initial setup.  Most likely this is a duplicate of #414  AG Home does not provide such feature (yet) so the only would be to configure iptables to not allow traffic from untrusted networks.  Yeah, this makes perfect sense, thank you for the suggestion! We were looking into this actually:\r\nhttps://github.com/inconshreveable/go-update Well, you might need to `cp` with sudo as well Try something like this:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/steinwaywhw/a4cd19cda655b8249d908261a62687f8 @frenck makes sense, thank you for mentioning it! @szolin testing instruction:\r\n\r\n1. Build AGH with redefined `versionCheckURL`: `-X main.versionCheckURL=NEW_URL`\r\n2. Publish a test `versions.json` to the `NEW_URL`\r\n3. Prepare and publish somewhere another build that will be \"the test new version\"\r\n4. Run AGH as a service\r\n5. Try the built-in update and check that it works as intended\r\n One more thing to do: \r\n1. Start using `selfupdate_min_version` field from `version.json`\r\n2. Use all files from the `zip`, not just the main binary  Is there any change if you disable protection in AG interface? In this case AG will simply bypass DNS requests to the upstream DNS. I have tried everything and no go. All off, zero filters. Get error. With direct 1.1.1.1 works correct.\r\n\r\nWe might need to introduce some extended logging to figure what's wrong here.\r\nJust in case, please try setting 8.8.8.8 as an upstream and check if there's any change.\r\n\r\n> Nice app, but useless with these small bugs. Like that I can't unblock sites.\r\n\r\nHow so? Could you please give an example?\r\n  Just in case We actually badly need it in v0.91 already -- to avoid additional setup steps for those who use their own VPS for AG Home.  We've learned a lot about most common issues users face while trying to install and use AdGuard Home. Addressing all of them is the most important thing we should do now.\r\n\r\nHere are the improvements I suggest:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a simple installation script for Linux / macOS that will register AdGuard Home as a service and perform necessary pre-configuration.\r\n2. Introduce an official docker image and support `docker pull`\r\n3. Add a \"setup\" page to the web admin interface that will help users configure their devices.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n* [ ] Installation script (linux only): https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/570\r\n* [x] DHCP server: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/423\r\n* [x] Web setup\r\n* [x] Docker image on `hub.docker.com`: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/562\r\n\r\n## Web setup\r\n\r\nIf initial setup is necessary, serve `install.html` page instead of `index.html`.\r\n\r\n### Setup steps\r\n\r\n1.

Resolved in the master branch.\r\n\r\nIt's experimental now so we expect some DHCP-related bugs  It shows stats for the last 24 hours only, not for all time.\r\n\r\nCould you please compare the total value with what's shown on the \"blocked\" chart?  Reproduced. The root cause is that when Pi starts up there's no network connection, the filter update fails and instead of doing nothing it replaces the filters contents with an empty string. Resolved by https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/32d4e80c93cba5b3ef4bb96c79f7256b5cb4d913  Good catch:)\r\n\r\nAds aren't loaded from that domain, but anyway, it makes sense to have it blocked:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/commit/962b11b8ae5fde0b01a49087c6f3e26cbe3dd53e  The behavior is different for the websites blocked by the parental control or browsing security modules (an access denied page) and for the websites blocked by any of the filters.\r\n\r\nWe will add an option to return a \"blocked request\" page for the latter as well (there's a feature request about that). > any news about the custom blocking page?\r\n\r\nNot until we deal with DHCP and web setup #423 #425  > I used port 1024, just added this port to iptables but same problem.\r\n\r\nDid you use port 1024 for the DNS server?\r\n\r\nPlease show me the output of this command:\r\n```\r\nnslookup -port=1024 example.org 192.168.0.28\r\n``` So the DNS server is okay. Are you sure your device supports configuring a DNS server on a non-standard port?  This is a bug indeed, AG does not work properly with DoT when it requires a hostname. Resolved with https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/4a357f1345bed8bb43027236feff0bc4b92de8fc\r\n\r\nHere's how to use it:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/453  Thank you for the contribution!  This is now possible via \"Clients\" settings: #727   Make sure that you've configured your devices to use AG Home:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki#how-do-i-set-up-my-devices-to-use-my-adguard-home  mm? Wow, awesome, thank you! @hmage plz review   Hi @TheRockStarDBA!\r\n\r\nI've answered this question here:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Adguard/comments/9oxj6m/meet_adguard_home_a_way_to_protect_the_entire/e7xeswu/\r\n\r\nAlso, this one is relevant as well:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/9oxdz0/adguard_home_vs_pihole_discussion/e7ynd9g/\r\n\r\nSorry for the links, I'd just like to not copy/paste :)  I suspect that it relies on DNS resolution and the problem might be that Cloudflare DNS does not respond with what Nest expects.\r\n\r\nTry replacing the upstream DNS in AdGuard Home settings with your network default DNS servers. @egarciarivera a few more questions then.\r\n\r\n1. Does it help to click \"Disable protection\" in AdGuard Home?\r\n2. Anything useful in the error message from the Nest app?\r\n3. Do you have the same issue when you sign in to Nest in Safari? Weird, but good that it's solved now:)  @trhdon123 hi! could you please just in case disable all the additional filters and keep the AdGuard SDN filter alone? I am afraid that AG might be misinterpreting some of the exception rules (those starting with `@@`) in easyprivacy/easylist. I just realized that we're troubleshooting it wrong way:)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, please open a terminal/cmd and run this command:\r\n```\r\nnslookup ad.doubleclick.net AG_HOME_IP_ADDRESS\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see something like this:\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup ad.doubleclick.net 192.168.7.2\r\nServer:\t\t192.168.7.2\r\nAddress:\t192.168.7.2#53\r\n\r\n** server can't find ad.doubleclick.net: NXDOMAIN\r\n``` You need to replace AG_HOME_IP_ADDRESS with the real IP address you used for configuring the DNS settings @dfmcvn thank you so much!  Merged into https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/685  Yup, good idea  How many active sockets do you have open on that BPi? Could it be that it's under some load at the moment? I mean it's possible that all this software combined can at some point have more open sockets than the default limit.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution would be to increase this limit:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/880557/socket-accept-too-many-open-files  Duplicate of #375   Hi! Replace `localhost` with your Pi's IP address I guess it can be closed now\r\n\r\n@dfmcvn @evansan thank you so much!  That'd be possible when we migrate from the current basic HTTP authentication to something more complicated  Here're some key points:\r\n\r\n1. AdGuard periodically downloads https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/master/version.json to check if there's a newer version\r\n2. AdGuard periodically checks filters updates\r\n3. If you enable (it's disabled by default) the \"use browsing security service\" option, AdGuard Home connects to the browsing security server and passes an 8-character prefix of the domain name's SHA256 hash. The server responds with a list of full hashes and AG Home checks if there's a match.\r\n4. If you enable (it's also disabled by default) the \"use parental control service\" option, AdGuard Home connects to the parental control web service using the same protocol as in point 3.\r\n\r\nThat's about it I guess. @IldarKamalov please add \"Privacy policy\" link to the footer when AGH privacy notice gets published  I guess even in the current state of AG Home, you can combine it with a proxy/VPN, but that'd require some additional configuration.\r\n\r\nOr would you like us to include a proxy server in AG Home eventually? @hoshsadiq well, here you can take a look at me experimenting with migrating AdGuard filtering engine to Go:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/urlfilter\r\n\r\nThere's even an example that uses `goproxy` (no cosmetic filters yet).\r\n\r\nIt will take quite more time to implement something feasible, though. Also, `goproxy` appears to be rather problematic and not really well maintained. I had to fork it and fix the most pressing issues: https://github.com/ameshkov/goproxy  > Is urlfilter currently used by adguard home?\r\n\r\nIt's not finished so not yet.\r\n\r\nAt first, we will use it's `DNSEngine` instead of the current one (as it brings some really important memory improvements).\r\n\r\nWhat for the proxy implementation, I need to finish with the implementation of cosmetic rules, and only after that, we will add it as an experimental feature to AGH.  Hi @prologic, thanks for a detailed explanation!\r\n\r\nCould you please share an example of the CoreDNS config file you're using? Just for us to better understand your needs.  AdGuard Home does respond with NXDOMAIN for AAAA requests for blocked domains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup -query=AAAA doubleclick.net\r\nServer:\t\t192.168.7.2\r\nAddress:\t192.168.7.2#53\r\n\r\n** server can't find doubleclick.net: NXDOMAIN\r\n```\r\n\r\n> So far I haven\u2019t been able to get IPv6 blocking to work.\r\n\r\nCould you please specify how did you test? > If you only leave the first one on, you get NXDOMAIN. If I'm not mistaking, NXDOMAIN is faster than 127.0.0.1... Something to look into maybe?\r\n\r\nIf a domain is blocked by an adblock-syntax rule like `||example.org`, AG Home returns NXDOMAIN.\r\nIf there's a matching host in one of the hosts files, AG Home returns the IP that's configured by the hosts file.   Done: #727   Another reason for moving everything to the dnsfilter module Fixed in https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/443 @puja108 if we're not able to implement everything we've planned in two weeks, we will publish an intermediate release. The necessary minimum is #423 and #450   Most of the in-app ads - yes.\r\nYoutube ads - most likely no, YT uses first-party domains for loading ads metadata. Blocking them will cripple the YT app itself.  Hi! Could it be that AdGuardHome was already running when you were editing the config file? It needs to be stopped at that moment.  Actually, we should keep this open as it's not just about docker image, but about a hassio addon. @frenck awesome, thank you! It makes sense to wait for v0.91 release as it brings some considerable changes and we'll have to rework the docker image once it's done.\r\n\r\n> Can we hook up on Discord or something else?\r\n\r\nI don't use Discord, but you can reach me by email: `am@adguard.com` or in Telegram  (`@AMeshkov`) if you use it. > Any progress on this? I have everything ready to go, but just missing the configuration storage location refactoring I guess...\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay. I really hope Santa will help us crack the built-in DHCP server issues and we'll push the release next week. @frenck thank you!  Hey guys, Google Chrome might be caching DNS responses, try restarting it  Yay, thank you:) Reopening as with v0.91 release we'll have to rework docker image considerably.\r\n\r\nThe major changes are:\r\n\r\n1. No more Corefile;\r\n2. Changes to the config file structure;\r\n3. Changes to the initial setup; @ewrogers will do, thank you! @integrii we registered an official account on hub.docker.com and prepared everything for automatic images publishing.\r\n\r\nShortly after v0.93 is released, we'll announce the official images as well.\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tag will correspond to the `master` branch (so it will be unstable), and `vXX.XX` tags will be published automatically for every new Github release. Here we go, the `latest` builds are already on docker hub and you can try them:\r\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/adguard/adguardhome\r\n\r\nPlease note, that these builds are automatically pushed there on every `master` change so they might be buggy / unstable. Uh, yeah, this parameter short name was changed in one of the commits.

We will, though:) Lol, apparently, Eugene had enough time :)\r\n\r\nActually, there're a lot of people demanding windows build so we might need to figure a workaround and not wait for it to be fixed in coreDNS. It seems that we'll be able to do it in v0.92 btw.\r\n\r\n> I'm finding that the average processing time is consistently >140ms\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the upstream is too slow. Resolved in the master branch  @ibksturm hey there! What version of `go` do you have? I can confirm that the version in the master branch can be built just okay with the following go versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.10.3 darwin/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go version\r\ngo version go1.11 darwin/amd64\r\n``` > hi andrej (right?)\r\n\r\nYeah:)\r\n\r\n> i'm using 1.7.4 (as in the debian packages), but now i'm compiling go 1.11 from github source...\r\n\r\nYou need to use 1.9+, 1.7 is quite old @ibksturm Bitte :) @hmage ? @OMICRON3069 \r\n\r\nYou have a newer perl that is more strict on regexes. This is a different problem.\r\n\r\nTry again, I've just pushed go modules support and removed perl invocation -- problem won't appear anymore.\r\n\r\nPS: if the problem still persists, open a new issue, commenting on closed issues might end up not being seen.  Works okay with the version which is currently in the master branch Most likely a duplicate of a resolved issue. Plz wait a bit, we're almost ready to publish the stable build of AG. @hoang-rio there's a strange issue with this hosts file list: https://abpvn.com/android/abpvn_adguard_dns.txt\r\n\r\nIt contains lines like `adtimaserver.vn 127.0.0.1` while the proper hosts file must be `127.0.0.1 adtimaserver.vn`.\r\n\r\nAnother option that works in AdGuard products only would be to omit the IP address and make records look like `||adtimaserver.vn^`. Such a rule will cover subdomains as well. The point is that you need to use `https://abpvn.com/android/abpvn.txt` to have these domains blocked > in custom filter rule example so i try revert format of my filter\r\n\r\nThat's our mistake indeed. It is also resolved in the master branch.  Here it is:\r\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_nb1tf_AdGuard_DNS.png\r\n\r\nReproduced on my private server. I am getting it when a request is blocked by a hosts file. @ibksturm what are the exact steps to reproduce it? I can't reproduce it on v0.91  @alectrocute generally, you are right. However, it seems that the way Youtube loads ads it country-specific. For some users, it does use third-party domains.  * Domain: `crashlytics.com`\r\n* Company: Google\r\n\r\n* Domain: `flurry.com`\r\n* Company: Yahoo\r\n\r\n* Domain: `hockeyapp.net`\r\n* Company: Microsoft\r\n\r\n* Domain: `app-measurement.com `\r\n* Company: Google\r\n\r\n* Domain: `appsflyer.com`  1. Show loader when it's loading\r\n2. Fix the sorting issue of the `Time` column (otherwise, it shows yesterday's records first)\r\n  * Tabler\r\n* CoreDNS\r\n* Go\r\n* ReactJs\r\n* NodeJs\r\n* NPM\r\n* What else?  Let's ask @Alex-302 if we can block Deezer ads on the DNS level or is it problematic The \"upgrade\" ad is hard-coded, it cannot be blocked even if you use the AG for Android app :( > For clarification, is it impossible for almost every in app full screen ads? Cause I've see them in some other apps to with Adguard DNS enabled.\r\n\r\nUsually, if an ad is third-party than it's possible to block it one way or another.\r\nIf this is a first-party hardcoded ad like in this case, it cannot be blocked.  @hmage plz extend the API.  Do we really need to resolve it that many times?  This is possible, but it is quite complicated feature so let's wait and see how many upvotes does it get @Threefish4096 \r\n\r\nIt is not on the v0.97 milestone yet, we have a number of more pressing issues. But there's a chance it will be implemented in the future.  False positive indeed, thank you!  Issue moved to [AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter #5](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/issues/5) via [**ZenHub**](https://www.zenhub.com/)\n  Instead of showing last 3 minutes stats, show \"last 24 hours\" in every \"top\" block.  1. [x] Move buttons up (like it's done on the dashboard)\r\n2. [x] Change the mechanism from ring buffer to 2 rotating buckets.\r\n3. [x] Change the label from \"DNS queries log\" to \"Last 5000 DNS queries\"\r\n4. [x] Add a search control to the query log: search input, \"blocked\" checkbox (to filter only the blocked requests).\r\n5. [x] Implement the \"infinite\" scroll feature (show first N records, show the next N when user scrolls down).  Issue moved to [AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter #3](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/issues/3) via [**ZenHub**](https://www.zenhub.com/)\n  @JamesXatu2 thanks for reporting! It's a problem in the code. Will be fixed in v1.0. @JamesXatu2  As a workaround while you wait, you can copy-paste the contents into \"custom filtering rules\" field -- hosts rules work there even now. Fixed in afd1fe21f69e15381a898a11b99ad1ab6a407402. Tests fixed in dd8396cec185cb6c39473351ffa2123f8ffde27c.  1. We can add a Wiki article\n2. Link this article from the \"Filters\" page: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_rq7vi_AdGuard_DNS.png Add these but keep them disabled by default:\r\n\r\n* `AdAway` \r\n    URL=`https://adaway.org/hosts.txt`\r\n* `hpHosts - Ad and Tracking servers only` \r\n    URL=`https://hosts-file.net/ad_servers.txt`\r\n* `MalwareDomainList.com Hosts List`\r\n    URL=`http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt`  Add these buttons to the Query Log as explained here:\nhttps://uploads.adguard.com/up04_mssk9_AdGuard_DNS.png\n\nNotify users what rule was created and where to find it. @IldarKamalov let's do this on JS-side, as @ameshkov proposes.\r\n\r\nLogic is relatively simple.\r\n\r\nIf user clicks 'block' on `www.example.com`:\r\n1. Search in user's custom filtering rules for `@@||www.example.com^$important`, if it exists remove it.\r\n2. If search in previous step gives no results, append rule `||www.example.com^$important` to the end of user's custom rules.\r\n\r\nFor `unblock` on `www.example.com` logic is similar:\r\n1. Search in user's custom filtering rules for `||www.example.com^$important`, if it exists remove it.\r\n2. If search in previous step gives no results, append rule `@@||www.example.com^$important` to the end of user's custom rules.  Done, thank you!\r\n\r\nIt will take some time for DNS server to update the caches.  We need step-by-step instructions on how to set up your own AdGuard DNS server.\r\n\r\n* [x] Guide for VPS  (DigitalOcean, Vultr, etc, etc)\r\n* [x] Guide for Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\nThese guides need to be linked from the README page.  After we rollout the changes in dcbe3dd4051f421553eb7782af67378f3d9ce85b on our servers, the blocking should be gone. New servers are now live,  the website is no longer blocked. Thank you for reporting this @FinnYoung   > urbanairship is not an ad company, right?\r\n\r\nThis is a mobile analytics company and that's why it can't simply be unblocked as this will unblock it for all AdGuard DNS users.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to set up your own AG DNS server and whitelist it there as it's explained in the repo readme. > A question. Can you tell me if urbanairship is added on the list recently or it's been there from before?\r\n\r\nThe company is not new, it was there for quite some time  Units of time vs number of requests shouldn't be on same axis:\r\n\r\n![eln6cfe9z2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/739119/45375128-c5387e00-b5fc-11e8-9955-f52e87f70ce4.png)\r\n  ![screen-shot-2018-09-11-18-36-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/739119/45371499-76d2b180-b5f3-11e8-844e-d22a3e30ba1a.png)\r\n  Hi!\r\n\r\nIt looks like you've downloaded wrong version of go.\r\n\r\nPlease verify this by running `go version`. It should fail with same error (unterminated quoted string).\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, you need to download go for ARMv6, it's on https://golang.org/dl/ if you scroll down a little bit.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the link \u2014 otherwise it wouldn't have been easy to figure out that the problem was because of wrong architecture.\r\n\r\nIf the problem still persists or you have any further questions, please let me know and feel free to reopen this issue. You're welcome! \ud83c\udf89   @As3ro not on the DNS level, unfortunately.  NOTE: This affects adguard DNS servers -- underlying issue has already been fixed in this repository and servers will be updated within short timeframe. New servers rolled out, fixes this and similar issues of subdomains not matching while domains are.  Hi! Not yet, but it's a good idea, I've just filed a feature request: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/issues/326  YouTube Android app? I doubt DNS has ever blocked ads in the YT app, DNS is just not enough for that.  It always returns \"OK 0 filters updated\" immediately even though I have a filter added. This is because `filtering/add_url` returns only after downloading the filter. So immediate request to `filtering/refresh` will return 0 because `filtering/add_url` just downloaded it and refresh will not redownload just-downloaded url.\r\n\r\n@maximtop @IldarKamalov -- could you guys please add confirmation dialog after `filtering/add_url` returns successfully with text `filter downloaded successfully`? Fixed in 81c7dbbc1684622e8b2e05d39dcd4605339ff24f  Can't reproduce it either :(  AG DNS is available on port 5353  @ip2location hi! It comes from EasyPrivacy: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt\r\n\r\nIf it's removed from there, it will be automatically removed from the DNS filter as well.\r\n  It comes from Easyprivacy filter which purpose is to block known trackers and web analytics.\r\n\r\nCould you please explain the purpose of the domain? @danwdart \r\n\r\n> It's a web technology stack and has various test domains for open source development of web services. Nothing about it is tracking-related, nor is it anything to do with analytics, it's just services for web publishers.\r\n\r\nCould you please point me out a place where I can read about it?\r\n\r\n@Alex-302 could you please take care of it? If this is not a tracking domain, it needs to be excluded from AG filters as well.   But we have more than 60 exclusions(a lot of sites) with this domain in Eng filter. Ok  Done.  No, it's a protocol, while sdns is a form of recording DNS server address `DOH` support has been added to `dnsproxy` in v0.9.11: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/releases/tag/v0.9.11\r\n\r\nHere's what we need to do now:\r\n\r\n1. Add new settings section, check the mockup: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_54sep_Diagrams_-_AGHome_Encryption__Moqups.png\r\n2. Use these new settings fields on both Web and DNS server initialization\r\n3. If any certificate in the chain is about to expire (<30 days), show a non-dismissable warning topline with the following text: \"Your SSL certificate is about to expire. Update [Encryption settings](https://example.org/).\"\r\n\r\nValidation rules:\r\n1. Check that the text entered to the \"Certificates\" field is a list of PEM-encoded certificates.\r\n2. Check that the text entered to the \"Private key\" field is a PEM-encoded private key.\r\n3. If server name is specified, check that it matches subaltnames of any of the specified certificates.\r\n4. HTTPS and TLS ports are **different** positive integers in the range of 80-65535. Setting HTTPS or TLS to 0 disables DOH/DOT. Done: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/590  We need to be able to configure \"sdns://*\" URL as an upstream. We have not yet. In the current version, if you want to have a dnscrypt upstream, you need to setup dnscrypt-proxy and use it's address as an upstream in AdGuard Home.

Please vote for this feature request if you'd like us to: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/issues/44 Tbh, I thought that it is clear:\r\n\r\n![](https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_fg8i2_Encryption__AdguardTeamAdGuardHome_Wiki.png)\r\n\r\n> How do I get the hash for http/2 stamp ?\r\n> And how to set so that AGH drops requests without the hash?\r\n\r\nYou mean dnscrypt-proxy like certificate-pinning hashes?\r\n\r\nWe don't support it yet, If you feel that this is important, please file a feature request. Sorry, I don't understand what exact hash do you mean.\r\n\r\nDo you mean a DNS stamp? Or a certificate pinning hash? @no-replies got it.\r\n\r\n`hashi` is purely client-side feature. `dnscrypt-proxy` verifies that your server certificate hash is equal to what was specified in `hashi`.\r\n\r\n> http/2 may be supported (sort of) but dnsstamp doesnt work. I think the issue is the hashi\r\n\r\nIt is optional. If you don't set any hash, `dnscrypt-proxy` will verify the certificate, but it won't check if hashes are matching (at least this is my understand, I guess @jedisct1 can clarify on this better.\r\n\r\n> Is there setting to drop non sdns requests. So that can have Doh on VM with open port but only let users with the sdns connect.\r\n\r\nThis is impossible. In case of HTTP/2, SDNS is internally translated into a simple https URL, so for the server (AG Home) the request looks just like a regular HTTPS request. > won't be able to verify the hash\r\n\r\nThey will if you enter the hash properly.

In the list of filters there were rules with ##, which should not be. And it was breaking the import of rules into iOS. Fixed  done  @ForkedLightning Fixed. Please, check connection to internet with DNSCrypt.  Do you mean IPv6 only? What cellular provider do you have? Might be the case indeed. Let's wait for the DNSCrypt support in AG Pro then.  Actually, we'd better take a look at the HAR file:\r\nhttps://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204410413-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting  Sorry, we had a problem with server on Singapore.

Because we use rules from `adservers.txt` and `spyware.txt` files.\r\n\r\nYou can add the domain in `rule.txt`.  @ameshkov Yes, the Adguard DNS server supports port 5353 for IPv6 > wouldn't it be easy to simply add a feature wherein instead of manually typing in or copy-pasting blacklist entries, one can input a URL, and the app would then automatically pull from and update the blacklist according to the contents of the URL?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely, we should provide an \"import\" feature.  @dibdot \r\nA stable and current version of the filter is located at: https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt  > You're latest PRs on the dnscrypt-proxy repo removed half of your DNS servers from the list of supported DNSCrypt servers : Which DNS servers support DNSCrypt?\r\n\r\nWe just don't want to spam the resolvers list with too many AG servers.

Which port(s) is(are) supported by which type of DNS?\r\n\r\nJust as you said, 53 and 5353 are for regular DNS, 5443 for DNSCrypt.\r\n\r\n> Do you plan on implementing DNSCrypt for other app?\r\n\r\nWe will implement it in AG for iOS. We don't plan to implement it in the desktop apps as there are plenty of other options for both PC&Mac that can be used along with AG.  Talking about AG DNS check on this page: https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html\r\n\r\nWe currently use these two domains to do the check:\r\ndnscheck-default.adguard.com\r\ndnscheck-parental.adguard.com\r\n\r\nThe problem is that they could be cached by Chrome and work even when AG DNS is disabled. Cannot confirm  The plan is to publish the source code once it is out of the beta testing stage. The problem is that while doing the beta test we decided to throw away everything and rewrite it, and that's why it takes so long :(\r\n\r\nCurrent architecture is: `frontend BIND <-> AG DNS server (written in java at the moment) <-> backend BIND --> upstream DNS servers`. AG DNS server is basically a UDP proxy that's able to parse incoming DNS requests and decide whether or not the request should be blocked or modified. It understands ad blocking rules syntax (instead of heavy hosts files).\r\n\r\nThe problem with the current implementation is that you can't simply set it up on a low-end device (router for instance) as all three parts of it are quite heavy. That's why we're rewriting it.  It's not about being intrusive or not, blocking some domains on the DNS-level leads to breaking quite a lot of websites' functionality.\r\n\r\nWhat for AG filters, here's the policy:\r\nhttps://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-filter-policy  Talking about DNS check on adguard.com, right?  The strange thing about it is that it's not on the list of suspicious:\r\nhttps://reports.adguard.com/en/my.screenname.aol.com/report.html\r\n\r\nWe'll check it, thanks for pointing it out!

Of course, we can't include a third-party filter as a rules source right away (easylist is the only exception), but we can come up with some \"staging/review\" approach later.

As soon as it is solved and function properly, the first release will be announced.\r\n\r\n> (b) I assume you will offer Premium services, similar to your Adguard apps for Windows and Androids.\r\n\r\nEventually, we'd like to provide the same functionality OpenDNS provides in their premium package. What for the price and the ETA on this, it's too early to talk about it yet. For instance, it might be offered for free for premium AG users.\r\n\r\n> With our 5 devices (2 PCs, 2 Androids, 1 DD-WRT router) your apps a bit expensive (needs 3 licenses?) but still worth our consideration.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, it can be covered by a 2-device premium license.  We use several public sources (like malwaredomains and such) + our own database: https://adguard.com/en/how-malware-blocked.html#filtersUpdate  Our server is [recursive and not authoritative](https://blog.opendns.com/2014/07/16/difference-authoritative-recursive-dns-nameservers/), so there are quite a few DNS servers in rotation in upstream. It depends on the server location. For instance, Yandex can be used from RU servers only, it'd be odd to use it from US servers.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note, though, that requests to upstream servers are made on behalf of our own server, and then cached on our side. > From your reply, this should not be happening?\r\n\r\nMore than this, most of the IP addresses listed above aren't used directly by us at all. I am not sure how precise is methodology used by dnsleak to detect all of this above.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we can be using some recursive DNS server (like opendns for instance), which, in turn, uses other recursive DNS, and who knows where this chain may lead. Guys, let me please explain how dnsleak does the check.\r\n\r\n1. They make your browser to load something from a unique domain name, generated just for this test purposes. Something like `blahblasdashdashs1023102931.dnsleak.net`\r\n2. Then they go through all known DNS servers and check if this unique domain name is cached by any of them.\r\n3. First DNS server found is considered to be yours.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that they don't have Adguard DNS in their known servers list. So they simply cannot detect us, and due to this they detect one of upstream DNS servers instead.  \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435\r\n```\r\nad.admitad.com\r\n```\r\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0421\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 DNS \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b:\r\n```\r\n@@||ad.admitad.com/*/?subid=*&ulp=\r\n``` @ameshkov \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c ad.admitad.com \u0432 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0440\u0435 DNS? \u0412 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0421\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0438. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u043b\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0435\u043c. > \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0435\r\n\r\n\u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b) \u0421\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u044b \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.\r\n\r\n> \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0430\r\n> nslookup tween-rnd.ru 176.103.130.130\r\n\r\n\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043c.

Just checked `sa.bbc.co.uk` and it is ok. \r\n```\r\n$ nslookup sa.bbc.co.uk 176.103.130.130\r\nServer:\t\t176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:\t176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nName:\tsa.bbc.co.uk\r\nAddress: 77.72.116.213\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan't say the same about `gate.hockeyapp.net`:\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup gate.hockeyapp.net 176.103.130.130\r\nServer:\t\t176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:\t176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nName:\tgate.hockeyapp.net\r\nAddress: 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Alex-302 I've excluded it from the DNS filter.\r\n@sclubone changes should go online in a few hours.\r\n > From a usability perspective, will whitelists be able to sync across devices? Otherwise all settings will nerd to be manually replicated for users with multiple iOS devices.\r\n\r\nWe're working on the sync functionality. The thing is that it requires much time as sync should work across all Adguard products. @Alex-302 try whitelisting `edigitalsurvey.com`  It is in both spyware and easyprivacy filters, and as I understand the purpose is just that: it is used by third-party scripts to obtain user's IP address. You have a point there.\r\n\r\nI guess when https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/pull/84 lands we can exclude it from the DNS filter.\r\n\r\nWhat for spyware filter and easyprivacy, you can disable it on your own. excluded from DNS filter  Resolved already guys  @Alex-302 this is a perfect example of why we need to use `exclusions` sometimes. However, I am not sure if we should really unblock this domain.\r\nLet it break zone.msn.com. > But where I can exit exclusions.txt?\r\n\r\nYou can't yet, unless new code is merged  The issue is resolved now.\n  Can't reproduce  Can't reproduce with default DNS servers and FF 54.\r\nAnyway, that \"something went wrong\" thing was just an anti-adblock kind of message. In fact, it didn't affect the functionality of the site.\r\n  https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/adguard-dns-%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0.12163/page-5#post-109770  Guys, I am sorry for this, again some issues on our side\n The downtime was ~1 hour again. Our reaction time during the weekend is really unacceptable, I am sorry for this.\n Not at all, downtime for more than 10 minutes is not acceptable. DNS downtime ceases the internet access for all its users.\n Poor Dyn:)\n @sandybeachit yep :)  Everything is described here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/issues/77#issuecomment-257735913\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/issues/77#issuecomment-258141148\r\n\r\nWe should re-think the way we apply exceptions.\r\n\r\nThere should be two types of exceptions:\r\n\r\n1. Good old `exceptions.txt`, leave it be.\r\n2. Some `exclusions.txt` file, which will work differently. Strings listed in this file should be filtered out of the source subscriptions during the compilation process. One more thing, we should remove all rules matching more than just a domain\n @Alex-302 please read this issue description, it is important for you as well.\n @Alex-302 you didn't get it.\n\n`exceptions.txt` - we already have it filled by you.\n`exclusions.txt` - new file. It contains a bunch strings (substrings actually). Each line of the DNS filter will be checked against this `exclusions.txt` file and matching lines will be removed.\n\nWe do this to not add unnecessary exceptions. For instance, currently when user enables \"AG DNS\" filter along with other filters, he gets a bunch of exceptions from it, which he does not really need.\n done  @Alex-302 i guess we should block only tracking subdomains\n newrelic is not just a tacking service, it can also be used for monitoring purposes.\n\nSo yes, I suggest replacing an old rule with these two:\n\n```\n||js-agent.newrelic.com^\n||beacon-1.newrelic.com^\n```\n  @mmigi @Alex-302 \r\n\r\nName: `Adguard DNS`\r\nDescription: `Filter used by Adguard DNS`\r\n\r\nWe should also add it's description to \"Filters\" page:\r\nhttps://adguard.com/filters.html @vbagirov @mmigi  let's change filter description.\n\nName: `Adguard DNS filter`\nDescription: `Filter used by Adguard DNS. Basically, it is a compilation of English filter, Social filter, Spyware filter, Mobile ads filter, EasyList and EasyPrivacy, transformed for better`\n\nAlso do the following:\n1. Supply a russian translation.\n2. Fix description in the filter template file: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/blob/master/Filters/filter.template\n3. Change filter's license to `http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/`\n4.

Instead of simply concatenating it with exceptions rules list, we should exclude whitelisted domains from it.\n  We have such page for requests blocked by malware/phishing module and parental control.\n\nThe thing is that we'd prefer not to do it for blocked ad/tracking requests as it will create unnecessary load on our servers (billions additional web requests from all DNS users).\n > manually report every false positive by submitting a ticket each time?\n\nYep, unfortunately it's the only way:(\n\nIt would be much better to report it here on github, though.\n  We don't yet support it.\n\nSome info for devs below:\n\n**RFC**\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-client-subnet-08\n\nGoogle public DNS supports it:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/public-dns-announce/67oxFjSLeUM\n  This site is blocked because it used as analytics/advertising on other sites.\n  @Fridrix we need to see trace to Adguard DNS servers (.130 and .131) as well.\n looks like an obsolete issue\r\nwe've requested more data from the user, will be reopened if still exists  Hi\nDid you check it on Android or Windows?\n I can't reproduce.\nWhich IPs are you using?\n @Alex-302 have you noticed that this is AG DNS repo?:)\n\n@Smultie how have you set up AG DNS? Do you use some sort of a DNS changer app?\n @ameshkov sure:) What's wrong?\n Now I got it, thank you! Unfortunately, this is a known Android issue:(.\n\nDNS changer uses a VPN API in order to change DNS servers. Sometimes Android cannot handle it properly and it breaks \"Download Manager\" app.\n\nThe problem is that the bug is rare and random, that's why it is still open in Android's bug tracker.\n Yep, that's it, sometimes changing DNS servers with a VPN API leads to a broken download manager.\n  Added to DNS filter\n\n```\n@@||bnc.lt^\n```\n  Hi\nThe site works as expected with our DNS, nothing blocked\n<details>\n![image](http://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/5778/UegoXA.png)\n</details>\n @Alex-302 takes care of filtering issues, and we need a dev to answer your question:)\n\nSo, what's going on:\n1. `87.245.196.91` is IP address of one of the Akamai CDN nodes.\n2. So, I guess `pluzz.francetv.fr` uses Akamai CDN.\n3. This particular node is located in Russia.\n4. The reason why AG DNS has resolved it to Russian akamai node is that it appears that you are routed to AG DNS servers located in Russia.\n\nWe currently have servers in two locations only: US and RU. Still waiting for EU and asian servers: #33. The ETA is a few weeks from now.\n Due to CDN nature their IP are often incorrectly blocked, so the right thing to do is to report it to the list authors.\n I'd prefer to have separate issues for each case.\n\nYou see, it'll help with issues search in case if some issue re-occurs.\n  explained here: #110  It makes sense, thank you for the feature request!\n We'll prioritize this issue, guys, thank you!

 Which DNS are you using? Family protection or default?\n Ok, added.\n  Weird, monitoring is silent. We'll check it asap\n Ah, I found the issue.\n\nThe thing is that current resolvers list is out of date, dnscrypt guys haven't yet merged the new data into it.\n\nHere is the current csv:\nhttps://gist.github.com/ameshkov/8cc0da559229f7e0dccd4fe2e1e4f355\n  `http://dw.cbsi.com/redir?`\nAdded to DNS filter:\n\n```\ndw.cbsi.com\n```\n  Yeah, that's a good idea. We'll do it after NL servers will be ready.\n it will be nice to see it on the new website :) @TPS yep it is  Agreed, we'll change it\n  The problem is that it is almost impossible to do on the DNS-level, it has already resolved domain into a \"blocking\" address, you can't just roll it back.\n\nFor false positives the only way is to report it to us and wait for the fix.\n  Added:\n\n```\n||crashlytics.com^\n||adserver.snapads.com^\n||mobileanalytics.*.amazonaws.com^\n||adserver.snapads.com^\n```\n\n> api.branch.io\n\nIt will break some apps.\n\n> iadsdk.apple.com\n\nI can't check it\n I don't know, but is not fast, as with common filters. Maybe 12 hours.\n @Alex-302 I suppose that you should put these rules to the \"Mobile Ads Filter\", don't make it dns specific. All these domains are also used in Android apps, so it could be helpful for AG Android.\n @Stillness-2 could you please what happens if we block Apple ad SDK domain?\n`iadsdk.apple.com`\n I guess we should try blocking these three:\n`googleadapis.l.google.com`\n`www-google-analytics.l.google.com`\n`ssl-google-analytics.l.google.com`\n\nBlocking google tag manager is dangerous, some apps may depend on it.\n`www-googletagmanager.l.google.com`\n Ok. Added to mobile filter:\n\n```\n||googleadapis.l.google.com^$empty\n||www-google-analytics.l.google.com^$empty\n||ssl-google-analytics.l.google.com^$empty\n||adserver.snapads.com^$empty\n||crashlytics.com^$empty\n```\n\nto spyware\n\n```\n||collector.githubapp.com^\n||events-endpoint-*.amazonaws.com^\n```\n\nBut these rule are missed in DNS filter:\n\n```\n||mobileanalytics.*.amazonaws.com^\n||quantcount.com^\n```\n @Alex-302 give it some time, they will be transferred to DNS filter eventually.\n > @ameshkov so these will be added to dns filter for iphone by the auto update correct? Just makikg sure xD\n\nYeah, it's just we do it not very often for DNS.\n ```\n||alog.umeng.com^\n||stats.jpush.cn^\n||log.iyunmai.com^\n||admarvel.*.amazonaws.com^\n||analytics-collector-*.elb.amazonaws.com^\n```\n\nI need a strings from the log for these requests.\n Text lines from the log file.\n @jo2dan23 it would be better to get the whole requests log file. It will be attached to the support email, named \"tunnel.txt\"\n @jo2dan23 could you please tell us your customer ID so that we could find the ticket?\n @jo2dan23 great, thank you! @Alex-302 will take a look at it.\n @ameshkov \n\n> @Alex-302 will take a look at it.\n\nthere are over 5k records. What should I do with it?\n @jo2dan23 please don't remove messages.\nI will check and add domains a little bit later.\n  https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html\n\nUpdate this line:\n`\u2014  Adguard DNS is completely free **for personal use**.

I was not able to reproduce it.\r\nI would really appreciate if you could also give it a try.\r\nYou can use https://dnscrypt.org/#dnscrypt-windows if you want. I think it's up to you. But it was reported without DNSCrypt. Can't reproduce, looks like it's resolved now.\r\n@sandybeachit please let me know if something goes wrong with those notifications at your end  It should be a bit better after we add 2 more US servers.\n\nAs I understand, currently you are using the east coast server, connection to the west coast server will be a bit faster.\n\nWe will add asian servers eventually, it's just we need more time to do it.\n > in witch city ?\n\nYou mean in which asian city? No idea yet.\n\nI am thinking about Singapore, I hope it will allow us cover both Asia and Australia.\n @ookangzheng  We have added 2 servers in Singapore, it has to be better now, please test when you have a chance  Hi! Do you mean there is an anti-adblock message there?\n  @Snapy what do they do for blocked HTTPS websites?\n @Snapy the problem is that when website is accessed via https we can't display the block page content as the block page won't pass https verification.\n Ah, ok, I see.\n\nAll blocked domains are resolved to 146.112.61.106, which in turn simply redirects you to block.opendns.com.\n\nFor plain HTTP it works as intended.\n\nFor HTTPS you'll see certificate error: \n<details>\n![privacy error 2016-09-12 11-26-56](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5947035/18429409/cfb7fa3c-78db-11e6-8252-e3bfe36c3451.png)\n</details>\n\nI guess there's no better option, so we'll do the same.\n @nkartyshov for this page use the same page layout as in AG for Windows parental control module.\n\nAdd a simple javascript there:\n1.

I mean not AG Safari extension, just load the content blocker extracted from iOS.\n @zebrum please re-check it   fix\n  By the time of release we should add the following servers:\n1 NY\n1 SF\n2 Netherlands\n First, let's make the common configuration on all servers (here i mean bind config).\n\nDefault configuration always listens to:\n`176.103.130.130`\n`176.103.130.131`\n\nFamily protection always listens to:\n`176.103.130.132`\n`176.103.130.134`\n After that set up automatic deployments to all the new servers.\n > isn\u00b4t it anycasted anyway?\n\nYep, it is. Currently our servers are located in US and RU. New locations are coming soon.\n @sandybeachit yes, we did yep, we have added 8 new servers and that's it for now :)   Read here the details:\nhttps://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-dns-beta/#comment-2846431854\n\nWe should do something about it.\n It already resolves IPv6 addresses, so this is no issue.\n\nWhat we need is to provide IPv6 DNS servers for those who simply cannot access IPv4.\n Done!\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS\r\n\r\nRegarding DNSCrypt, it will be updated in due course (the pull request was accepted recently, but we need to add one more).  \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b. \nhttp://i80.fastpic.ru/big/2016/0809/e8/c76645bed781c386c5166e40ca6f5ae8.png\n\n\u041e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0434: https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/adguard-dns-%D0%91%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0.12163/page-3#post-95100\n  Source:\nhttps://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/adguard-%D0%9F%D0%A0%D0%9E-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-ios-v1-0-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0.12328/#post-95468\n\nExample:\nhttps://kinovo.me/3419-mehanik2-2016.html\n\nI am not sure about DNS though, it may be broken by other products as well.\n  For instance:\nhttps://www.my5.tv/celebrity-big-brother/season-11/episode-14\n @Alex-302 are you sure AG DNS works through that VPN?\n Open doubleclick.net:)\n @nkartyshov advise something for @Alex-302 to test such geo-restricted cases\n Still can't reproduce with privateinternetaccess.com VPN. Checked both DNS.\nWith Adguard for windows with enabled parental control it also works.\n  https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/adguard-dns-beta.12162/page-3#post-95135\n Done\n  fixed\n  Test web page like this:\nhttps://www.opendns.com/welcome/\n\nI suggest adding such a test block to the DNS overview page:\nhttps://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html\n\nSomething like this:\nhttps://monosnap.com/file/MFbYhCTOK0WrPIXlNxJD1mGM9xjS21\n done\n @nkartyshov it does not work on the russian side:\nhttps://adguard.com/ru/adguard-dns/overview.html\n @nkartyshov now it works on the ru side and does not work on en side.\n\nAlso I guess in @Marko321 case it could work that way because of dns cache.\nTo fix it you should use random subdomains instead.\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```\n$(function() {\n    $.ajax({\n        url: 'https://' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000) + '.dnscheck-default.adguard.com/',\n        method: 'GET',\n        timeout: 3000,\n        success: setDnsMode\n    });\n    $.ajax({\n        url: 'https://' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000) + '.dnscheck-parental.adguard.com/',\n        method: 'GET',\n        timeout: 3000,\n        success: setDnsMode\n    });\n});\n\nfunction setDnsMode(mode) {\n    var dnsCheck = $('.dns-check');\n    $(dnsCheck).find('.fa').removeClass('fa-times').addClass('fa-check');\n    $(dnsCheck).find('.text').hide();\n    if (mode == 'default') {\n        $(dnsCheck).find('#default-mode').show();\n    }\n    if (mode == 'family') {\n        $(dnsCheck).find('#family-mode').show();\n    }\n}\n```\n @Marko321 I fixed the problem. Please, check.\n  What exactly causes this?\n\nAffected domain:\nvmf.edge-apps.net\n @Alex-302 here is a link:\nhttp://www.americatv.com.ar/vivo\n Seems to be resolved with `@@||imasdk.googleapis.com^`\n I've added this rule to exceptions, let's see if it helps\n @Alex-302 the issue is back\n @ameshkov I think it is caused by\n\n```\ngoogleadapis.l.google.com\n```\n\nIt was excluded in DNS filter today. I will check it after rebuild of DNS filter.\n  @andrews05 great idea, thank you!\n @nkartyshov please do both things: Google SafeSearch and YT restricted mode.\n @andrews05 I wonder will it work for the Yahoo search as well?\n @nkartyshov also here is an instruction for Yandex:\nhttps://yandex.ru/support/search/schoolsearch.xml#hosts\n done\n Oh, I see what's the issue \n\n```\n192-168-10-199:~ ameshkov$ nslookup www.google.com\nServer:     176.103.130.132\nAddress:    176.103.130.132#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nwww.google.com  canonical name = forcesafesearch.google.com.\nName:   forcesafesearch.google.com\nAddress: 216.239.38.120\n\n192-168-10-199:~ ameshkov$ nslookup www.google.ru\nServer:     176.103.130.132\nAddress:    176.103.130.132#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   www.GOOGLE.ru\nAddress: 216.58.209.195\n```\n\n@nkartyshov you have forgotten about ALL other google domains.\n @nkartyshov the list of google domains:\nhttps://www.google.com/supported_domains\n @andrews05 I added the missing domains.

So I hereby request adding support for them.\r\n2) As pointed out in #867, entries with most `$` modifier are simply thrown in the bin, instead of being narrowed down to their supported criteria. Thus it's rather weird to see `||example.com$important` be supported, whereas `||example.com$empty,important` is not, despite how `$empty` is even an AdGuard-brand-specific modifier. Examples can potentially be made for entries that rely on e.g `noop-js` and similar super-specific modifiers; those can maybe or maybe not remain ignored.\r\n3) AdGuard Home's hosts file support seems to be identical to that of other hosts-file tools, which leads to the always unfortunate problem that has been inherent to the hosts system for 35 years, in which one needs to know if a domain is prefaced by `www.` or not, and where `127.0.0.1 www.example.com` and `127.0.0.1 example.com` are treated separately. I hereby propose supporting or adding an option for treating `www.` and non-`www.` hosts entries the same.\r\n4) On top of all of the above three, I propose supporting or adding an option to treat domains rules (`example.com`, as in section \u21161) and hosts rules (`127.0.0.1 [www.]example.com`, as in \u21163) as if they were `||example.com^$important`. For a lot of sites that such rules tend to cover, one would sometimes want or have to block way more broadly than just the front page.\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\nI'll use the extremely safe and ad-free Norwegian newssite `nrk.no` as the example for this, for convenience's sake.\r\n\r\n1. Paste any one of either `nrk.no`, `www.nrk.no`, `127.0.0.1 nrk.no`, or `nrk.no^$empty,important` into *Custom filtering rules*.\r\n2. Try to load `nrk.no` on a unit that is using such a rule.\r\n3. See that the page loads normally.\r\n4. Paste `127.0.0.1 www.nrk.no` or `||nrk.no^$important` into *Custom filtering rules*.\r\n5. See that the page now successfully fails to load.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\nUnsure what I'd have to take a screenshot of, in that case.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| v0.97.1 ARM, seemingly 32-bit\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| System, if I understand the question correctly\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| Raspberry Pi 4\r\n| Operating system and version:| Raspbian \"July 2019\"\r\n| Client unit that I tested the syntax support on:| Lenovo K5 Vibe, LineageOS 14.1, using *[DNS Forwarder Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evanhe.dfpro)*\r\n > I guess we could do this for the domains-only lists. Unlike /etc/hosts syntax, we're more or less free in how we interpret them\r\n\r\nNeed to be careful with this. I got caught out with domains such as `www.be` being replaced with ||be^ which blocks all sorts, such as `youtu.be`\r\n\r\nI ended up running a string substitution for www. only where there is another proceeding `. `: `^www\\.(?=(?:[^.\\n]+\\.){1,}[^.\\n]+$)`\r\n >They actually are supported since v0.96. If the rule is just a domain name, it is treated as `0.0.0.0 example.org`.\r\n\r\nOkay, so now that I saw that answer, I decided to use my main PC as a test client instead of my phone (thinking there could be something wrong with the app I used or with *Firefox for Android*), as well as testing with multiple sites that my browsers had far smaller local caches for, I can now confirm that domains really *are* supported. I thank you for clueing me onto it.\r\n\r\n>If you think that there are some other modifiers that can be added to the list of supported, please tell me which ones.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I think `$third-party` and `$~third-party` (and uBO's special versions thereof), `$script`, `$generichide`, `$subdocument`, and `$image` could be worth looking into adding support for.\r\n\r\n>(The stuff about hosts files)\r\n\r\nGood points. I too find the 'hosts' syntax to be woefully inadequate in 2019, but unfortunately a lot of old-timers and Android enthusiasts like Dan Pollock, Steven Black, and Energized base their filterlist making on it.\r\n\r\n>Need to be careful with this. I got caught out with domains such as `www.be` being replaced with ||be^ which blocks all sorts, such as youtu.be\r\n\r\nA workaround that sounds easy enough to my non-technical ears, could be to only clone(?) `www.` entries if it has two period dots instead of one. The main issue with including the options are that as a standard dns request, it's impossible to distinguish first party from third party, whether it's a script etc.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty is that we are applying filters intended mainly to be browser level, network wide. So things such as `||ospserver.net^$third-party` may be fine for your browser, but if you have a Samsung phone then it'll block updates.. And this is just one example. I'm sure the `image` and `script` options will likely include many otherwise legitimate domains.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately DNS based blocking really is rather primitive in comparison to filter lists. You can think of the `filter` support only really as a way to wildcard blacklist / whitelist.\r\n\r\nThis feature alone is incredibly helpful though. It cuts down host file sizes to a fraction of the size if you convert everything to wildcards and remove the subdomains.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the several huge advantages over pihole. That certainly sounds interesting. I have however heard of issues with regards to custom certificates / clients and some apps being tricky to trust them without root - Is this similarly the case with the proxy?\r\n\r\nRegardless I'd be very eager to give this a try providing my RPI 3b could handle it I've ended up created something of an intermission non-automatic compilation list of my own, until more `$` modifiers become processed or bypassed properly: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt\r\n\r\nIt compiles 6 lists whose blocking rules are currently not particularly supported by AdGuard Home: EasyList, uBlock Filters, uBlock Filters - Badware Risks, Nano Defender Integration, Liste FR, and I Don't Care About Cookies. More lists may or may not be added to it. It'll probably be re-synced with the upstream lists every 1-3 weeks.    Can you please give the option to use AdGuard Home as the default gateway and then forward traffic to the real default gateway, this could be set via DHCP. @zero77 hi there\r\n\r\ni think this is definitly not a good idear, arguments are:\r\n\r\nacting as a gateway is mutch more complicated than dns (corebussines  of AGH Guys) or DHCP (still in beta). you have to look at firewall , different connection types (ipv4, ipv4, pppe, mobileshit, isdn etc etc), tunneling stuff (6in4, 4in6 etc). story wanna go forward with vpn solutions (ipsec, openvpn, wireguard and how them all named). and if all things are implement, the magic and mystical unicorn wanna dmz, static routes, portforwarding, port triggering and perhaps triggered port. oooh i forgett acting as NAS, DECt/SIP releaise and so on...\r\n\r\ndon\u2018t missunderstand me, i just think about and got the experience that openwrt (actual 18.06.4) with AGH makes much more sence. \r\n\r\nas a simple calculation, on AGH works about 15...20 people, on openwrt (who\u2018s core job IS acting as a gateway) worked over years about 800...1200 peoples... thats 40..60 time more ressources & knowledge. \r\n\r\nhope you understand my opinion\r\n  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new

you  I'm running adguardhome container in  SBC, system(dietpi/debian OS, at home and office) is install on a TF card, so I want to  lower writes to TF card (to make it live longer). but also want to keep a litle latest logs for analysis.\r\n\r\nis it able to \r\n**(a)** move log file \"_querylog.json_\" to a separate folder, like _/opt/adguardhome/work/logs_ ?  \r\n\r\n(so I can map the sub folder to host OS _/var/log_ folder, it's in RAM and clear every hour) I have tried map the querylog.json with a empty file, container will fail and _docker logs_ is empty\r\n\r\n**OR** \r\n\r\n**(b)** just save some latest logs (like 100 query) in ram and show in web console, and **disable** log write to disk.\r\n\r\nthank you. @ameshkov in dietpi, move whole working to ramdisk(/var/log) will cause filters be deleted with querylogs.json update of my misunderstand about diet-pi ramlog, it won't delete all files in /var/log/, just OS logs will be purged. so my _suggestion **a)**_ will not work as intend. \r\n(querylog.json will persist and use same size physical ram, so it's not a good idea, my bad)\r\n\r\nsuggestions \r\nb) save x lines to ram and show/update in console , c) send query logs to a syslog server\r\n\r\nthank you. for myself, I won't check the statics very often, I can accept statics be reset in short time. \r\nknowing AGH is working will be just fine.  When using DoH upstreams, DNS queries to AGH will timeout when my router switches to the backup internet connection. After few minutes it proceeds to work again. \r\n\r\nThis does not occur when using DoT instead of DoH. My personal suspicion is that with DoH, persistent HTTPS connections are used and it would stop DNS resolution until the existing connections times out.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Test DNS resolution - it works\r\n2. Shut down the main internet connection to cause a failover.\r\n3. Test DNS resolution again - times out\r\n4. Wait a few minutes, DNS resolution works again.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nDNS Resolution should work without timing out on WAN connection failover\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nDNS starts timing out for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\nRouter has 2 internet connections, one fiber connection and a backup LTE.\r\nAGH is installed in a docker container and exposed to network with MACVLAN.\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server: | 0.96-hotfix\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| Docker container w/ MACVLAN\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| Official AGH Docker Image\r\n| Operating system and version:| Docker on Ubuntu 19.04\r\n  I have tested this on FreeBSD and works great, exept for this \"Bug\" #870 \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see the FreeBSD version official supported so i can easy update and install the software.

I'm assuming that AdGuardHome skips over these intentionally, but the user is given no notice of this. In-fact, it's quite misleading as a 'rule count' is displayed (number of lines as opposed to actually processed rules) which leads the user to believe that entries have been found and will be processed accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Extra\r\nI'm aware that your 'AdGuard Simplified Domain Names filter' may well include the filters from these files, but is there no way for AdGuardHome to be able to process these individually? I know that we don't have the flexibility to determine whether the requests are from third-party or not etc, but is it not safe to assume that even if they are listed as third-party, they could be blocked in the same way as `||test.com^`?\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| 0.96-hotfix\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| (Router)\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| Raspberry Pi 3b\r\n| Operating system and version:| Raspbian Buster\r\n > Tbh, it's hard to say what exact issues it will cause.

I appreciate your consideration :-) I personally use prepared hosts file RuAdList + EasyList from repo by raletag (http://cdn.raletag.gq/rueasyhosts.txt). No idea how original filter list is converted into hosts file, but it is definitely useful for me and works perfectly. I suppose there should be some script converting EasyList records into hosts file records, despite most of \"high-level\" logic which is not supported by DNS.\r\n @alexsannikov the problem with converting filters to standard host format is that you won't block all of the subdomains. E.g. `2o7.net`, which is listed in your host file, has plenty of blacklisted sub-domains in other host files, but your host file lists only the top level entry.\r\n\r\nI believe, although I could be wrong, that uBlock Origin classes each standard host file entry as `||something.com^` - Which would enable this list to work properly with the browser extension. But obviously things are processed differently with AdGuard.\r\n\r\nI've extracted what I believe are the appropriate filters (restrictive and whitelist) from various sources over here: https://github.com/mmotti/adguard-home-filters (filters.txt).\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to do it is (in Python, at least):\r\n\r\n1) Run a regex str replace on the filter strings:\r\n```\r\n# Remove lines that don't start with @@|| or ||\r\n'^(?!(?:@@)?\\|\\|).+$': '',\r\n# Remove $third-party suffix\r\n'\\$third-party$': '',\r\n# Remove IP addresses\r\n'^\\|\\|(?:[0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\\^$': '',\r\n# Remove empty lines\r\n'^[\\t\\s]*(?:\\r?\\n|\\r)+': ''\r\n```\r\n2) Match remaining entries against:\r\n( I realise there is little validation here of whether the actual domain is valid)\r\n```\r\nfilters = '^\\|\\|([a-z0-9-_.]+)\\^(?:\\$(?:third-party|document))?$'\r\nwildcards = '^@@\\|\\|([a-z0-9-_.]+)\\^(?:\\||\\$third-party)?$'\r\n```\r\n3) For each filter object: check whether `test.com` is in whitelist, or `.test.com` is in whitelist.\r\n4) Reverse match against the whitelist for the partial string (`.test.com`) to identify the partial domain that matched --> `domain.test.com`\r\n5) Collect verified whitelist items rules only(rules that have a conflicting restrictive filter rule) to an array / set. Otherwise we are importing lots of unnecessary whitelist entries that don't apply to our standard wildcard blocks.\r\n6) Convert filter strings: `test.com` --> `||test.com^`\r\n7) Convert whitelist strings: `domain.test.com` --> `@@||domain.test.com^`\r\n\r\nOr at least that's how I had to do it in Python.\r\n\r\nI know this is probably blatantly obvious to you guys, but if it saves you any time at all, then it's worth me writing it down.\r\n @mmotti You are right, without additional scripting using of plain hosts files is painful. \r\nYou have a great logic to prepare AdGuard Home filter lists from 3rd party hosts files, I personally use similar one: I sort the list and go through line by line. If I have any top-level domain I am leaving this record only and removing all the strings with sub-domains. Finally, I just add || at the beginning and thus all the sub-domains are blocked by default. \r\nThis logic makes sense, 'cause if we block root domain (TLD) it means all sub-domains should be blocked too. I never met requirement to block TLD but unblock sub-domain. \r\nAnyway, as you already explained, we can 'whitelist' some domains/sub-domains with additional \"@@ <domain> $important\" imperative (don't forget about \"important\"!), which has higher priority than any other filter and allows required domain.\r\nAnd yes, ||something.com^ is enough to block whole domain name.\r\nP.S. I don't use pure hosts files, I collapse them (usually 2-3 times or even more), match records for all of them to avoid duplicates, and then add some AdGuard Home regexps (||, @@, ^, $important etc.).\r\nMy post was about the way how to get easily list of domains for blocking in \"pure\" format. Otherwise, some extra logic must be applied to EasyList or any other filtering list in AdBlock format to exclude any unsupported expressions. As I am not programmer, I chose the simplest way :)  @ameshkov Wow, that's cool! Will look into that. Thanks! Just to note with this:\r\nI noticed that `||ospserver.net^$third-party` from EasyPrivacy breaks Samsung phone updates.\r\n\r\nIt may be a one off, but it could also mean that a significant whitelist update could be required or the user will need to be aware that if they aren't using the specially provided AdGuard filter, that they may need to be more active with whitelisting.  If you assign a specific name to the client instead of his IP (via MAC address), then it is not displayed on the \"top clients\" board. Adguard Home version: v0.96-hotfix (See the screenshot)\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n![img](https://uploads.adguard.com/TheHasagi9ub82.jpg)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n @ameshkov Even if I restart from terminal Then we should make a better description/explanation about Client settings/add client via MAC  Hi guys!, will it be possible to add in the future an option to block the ip that try to access the force to the dashboard? it could be useful in vps where anyelse can try to make brute force.\r\nsomething similar to fail2ban.\r\n\r\nalso have the possibility to unblock the ip from cli or the yaml file.   The default value of blocked_response_ttl is too short.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default value of blocked_response_ttl is very short (10 seconds), so the blocking domain information is queried many times.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf blocked_response_ttl is long, information on blocked domains is cached for a long time, which stabilizes the block performance.\r\n\r\nI think it is better to set as long as 3600-18000 seconds (1-5 hours).\r\n I can understand the disadvantages you point out, but I still think that 10 seconds is too short.\r\nSince the optimal value varies depending on the usage environment, I also respect your opinion.\r\n\r\nThank you for your reply.  Raspbian released Buster lately: https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/buster-the-new-version-of-raspbian/\r\n\r\n<s>I just upgraded</s> on my Pi 3 B+ ...

Every single page and domain must be checked for this ever and ever again. Not an intelligent solution, sorry.  I've using Adguard home from the begining till now, but there are some strange request of DNS lookup from my query...\r\n\r\nStrange client like\uff1a\r\neml-srv.info (185.222.211.12)\r\nhosting-by.directwebhost.org (45.227.253.242)\r\ncustomer.worldstream.nl (91.229.23.68)\r\n141.98.80.54\r\ncustomer.worldstream.nl (62.112.9.43)\r\nswim.diverseenvironment.com (185.211.245.198)\r\n\r\nWhich lots of query request I don'n know who are them, I'm not sure these query will make my computer slow, or make my computer like a middle server to attach other website.\r\nCan I block these user I don't know? Thank you.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35817374/59687089-546b6580-920f-11e9-93e2-8b253d45e450.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35817374/59688053-94324d00-920f-11e9-992f-37e734bf1420.png)\r\n You should block unwanted clients via Access configuration settings.\r\nIf a DNS server can be accessed from the Internet - it's normal if someone else starts using it.  Running adguard home on raspbian.\r\n\r\nI had 0.92 hotfix 2. There is a messae saying that there is an update available (0.96) but i cant see a way to update it.\r\n\r\nI even removed the service, the AdGuardHome folder and downloaded 0.96, ran tjhrough installation but its still showing as 0.92 with an update available and the filers are still there.\r\n\r\nI thought the filters are stored in AdGuardHome/Data so how are they still in the webui after i have deleted the folder  I have a backup DNS running in the cloud and would like to restrict it, but I don't know the potential range of my ISP in case my IP changes, so I would like to restrict to any IP's that are from a certain domain to let through.\r\n ISP's like comcast have 30 million+ users, and I'm unaware of a way to know which ranges belong to which area, so it'd be hard to limit it that way. basically, instead of having to find every *.comcast.net subnet, be able to allow *.comcast.net.\r\n\r\nThe other idea is to be able to use 'blah.dyndns.org' as a host, instead of an IP, which will resolve to the allowed IP. I need exactly this feature. I have a remote computer I want to use my Adguard Home DNS server on, but the remote computer has a dynamic IP. I set up a dynamic DNS for it and it works well. It would be nice if you could enter the DNS into \"allowed clients\", then Adguard would use the upstream or bootstrap DNS servers to resolve it and then use the resulting IP as the allowed client.\r\n\r\nI would actually prefer to do it via Windows Firewall, but that only allows IP addresses or ranges. It seems like a script should be possible to resolve the dynamic DNS, then update the resulting IP as a firewall rule. But I don't have the skill to write one! :\\ _Edit - I found one here: [https://bit.ly/2LG30Rz](https://bit.ly/2LG30Rz), I'll try it out later._  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure

Found the issue. It is related to systemd-resolved. On Hypriot the systemd-resolved is bound to 127.0.0.1:53 and this crashes Adguard with macvlan support (even so Adguard is starting on an 192.168.1.x ip). Without macvlan it just says the port is in use, but since macvlan is bound to another IP this should not crash. this is what I did to solve it:\r\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved\r\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\r\nsudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved\r\n\r\nto answer your question: yes yeah, that is what put me on the wrong track... \r\n Even starting systemd-resolved when Adguard is running (with macvlan) doesn't crash it anymore, maybe the start of Adguard tries to open the wrong ip/port combo ? Disregard that statement, it just went down with signal 2 I don't want to spoil the party, but I don't run systemd-resolved in my system. It has been hard disabled and DNS management by the NetworkManager has been disabled as well, still, I run into this.\r\n\r\nEdit: Nevermind, @vtacquet told already to disregard. @ameshkov I can test it... nevertheless, I do not have a reproduction trigger, as in, it occurs rarely at my end.

Suggestion. Currently it is only possible to whitelist domains using the 'Custom filtering rules'  form. It would be nice if we could add whitelist lists that are dynamically updated just as blacklist lists. For reference see the lists here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist\r\nhttps://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist/tree/master/domains\r\n\r\n I would really like this feature, as although I have manually added the domains to the custom area (30 minutes later), now I need to constantly check my sources for any updates or changes made in case more are discovered or domains change (Microsoft & Facebook does that a lot).\r\n\r\nSince those lists are in a format just like the blocking ones, I would love to be able to have it automated.  Hi!\r\n\r\nI have a request for a new feature. I'd like to be able to individually set a different DNS for a client than the globally set one. One of the reasons I'd like to do this is because the AdGuard parental control/secure browsing modules are so slow (I get over 1000 ms increased average proccessing time when I enable them) that I want to use a DNS with built in family protection for the devices my childen use. At the same time I don't want family filter for all devices, so using for instance AdGuard family DNS globally isn't an option. \r\n\r\nMaybe an option like this:\r\n\r\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46295914/59148650-f4551200-8a0b-11e9-901a-ebb863c9e957.png)\r\n\r\n ![Upstream DNS-\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46345396/59149041-0db08b00-8a19-11e9-9846-abfd057a9590.png)\r\nI think that would be better. Yes, you got my idea perfectly right!\r\n\r\nIs my idea doable or would it require too much effort? It would definitely solve my issues with the slow Parental/Secure browsing modules if I could instead set a specific client to use a family protected DNS. I'd like to expand the \"User Profiles\" feature and have the possibility to configure EVERYTHING for each user. It may include EVERY option available in global settings, as well as chance to choose which filter lists to apply to this user, which upstream DNS to use, and any specific settings which must be applied to this particular profile.\r\nUnfortunately, now \"User Profiles\" feature works differently I expected. I wanted to use it to disable some access for children devices, applying some custom filters to the kid's profile (for example, not to give access to any social networks), but leave access to other users globally. Currently, I cannot choose/allow the specific filter to specific user (maybe I use it wrongly?).\r\nAgain: User's Profile for specific device must have as much settings as possible, fully replicating the Global settings featureset plus Filters plus maybe some specific settings applicable to this profile only (for example, don't log this user's activities). The list of settings must be extendable for future expansion.\r\nJust my two cents.\r\nThanks.  - This feature shouldn't affect to low-end devices disk or ram\r\n- Detect blocklists changes automatically\r\n You can have a web server running on 127.0.0.1 and serving those lists. Then 'add filter' like you would do for any other online list and use the localhost address in the URL field. Have different files for categorization. @anindyamaiti complex task :) I was just giving an alternate solution that will work right now, because I didn't see any response from the devs yet.\r\n\r\nAlso, setting up a web server is not as complex as you make it sound. It takes couple of package installations and less than 5 minutes of time. I recommend trying out [`lighttpd`](https://www.lighttpd.net/) if you have resource constraints:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get update`\r\n`sudo apt-get install lighttpd`  I've been using this service file with Systemd on Fedora since I started using this project earlier this year. It's always worked for me. I left the commented Exec lines because that's how it's documented to behave as a service, but I found them not necessary.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Unit]\r\nDescription=AdGuard Home\r\nDocumentation=https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome\r\nAfter=network.target\r\n\r\n[Service]\r\nType=simple\r\nUser=root\r\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/AdGuardHome\r\nExecStart=/opt/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome\r\n#KillSignal=SIGINT\r\n#ExecStart=/opt/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome -s start\r\n#ExecRestart=/opt/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome -s restart\r\n#ExecStop=/opt/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome -s stop\r\nRestart=on-failure\r\n\r\n[Install]\r\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\r\n```  **Let's do some enhancement**\r\n\r\n- \u2610 **Check program updates automatically** (enabled by default)\r\n (or \u2610 **Check for program updates every 8 hours/days**) \r\n[already adguardhome v0.96 check updates and notify user]\r\n  note: necessary 'Check Update' or above mentioned 'Refresh' button too.\r\n\r\n- \u2610 **Automatically download program updates**\r\n _(if checked, program updates will be automatically downloaded.

It should also send an email to root summarizing the update and any settings change that may have resulted from it. Finally, add an entry in the wiki about how to set up postfix to redirect root email. It is also desirable that this feature be customizable to enable and disable it. https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/815#issuecomment-500097216 @ameshkov \r\nI love when I have everything under control and for this I want so that I can turn off this \"silent automatic update\" feature or turn it on myself.  does parallel queries speed up dns only when there are 2 or more upstreams specified?  - [ ] Redirect all blocked requests that don't have `$drop` rule to a local webserver which serves a proper \"Blocked by AdguardHome\" page with \"unblock\" and \"unblock this time\" buttons\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3318223/59064548-d02def80-88aa-11e9-903d-a7378bbb2fca.png)\r\n\r\n<hr>  It would be nice to separate webui and service. Would allow you to run service only. Would require all webui options to be changeable through config (or cli?).   This race is a minor issue actually (it does no harm).

Can you create a version of this software optimized for arm v7? \r\nIt you can't ,can you Tell me how to do? Thanks  Take a look to this service\r\nhttps://www.nextdns.io/\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/bt2o66/we_are_launching_nextdnsio_a_combination_of/\r\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20012687\r\nYou could do the same, monetize the protect, make money and speed up the development  Hello all, I wanted to point out a few things regarding docker. Happy to raise a PR but wanted to check if you guys are on board with this. Looking at the main [Dockerfile](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/6261fb79abdef52889a2f87b1330225ea1c3c696/Dockerfile).\r\n\r\n> ```FROM alpine:latest```\r\n\r\nCan be removed and set to `FROM scratch`. This will allow it to have even less unnecessary things in the container. From what I can see, the only thing that's really required is the `ca-certificates`, however, this can be installed, and then copied from a previous build (iirc simply copying /etc/ssl is plentiful).\r\n\r\n> ```RUN setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+eip' /opt/adguardhome/AdGuardHome```\r\n\r\nthis capability is unnecessary as this only applies inside the container. But why is it important for the service within the container to be bound to ports lower than 1024? What really matters is the port it's assigned to on the host, because at the end of the day, the port on the host is what will be talked to by the clients.\r\nSuggestion: remove the who capabilities piece, and simply bind to ports everything above 1024 (e.g. 1053, 1067 etc). Then suggest within the docker run command to do the correct bindings (i.e. `docker run -p 53:1053` etc).\r\n\r\n> ```nobody```\r\n\r\nObviously, since alpine doesn't exist, the user/group \"nobody\" won't exist anymore either. This is easy to circumvent, simply create a file called `passwd.minimal` (or whatever you wanna call it), and add it into the container: `ADD passwd.minimal /etc/passwd`. This way you'll be able to use `USER nobody` and continue to keep the file permissions as `nobody`. \r\n\r\n> ```COPY --from=build --chown=nobody:nogroup /src/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome /opt/adguardhome/AdGuardHome```\r\n\r\nIf the first two things are addressed, the location of the binary and configs are now redundant and don't matter. No need to create `/opt/AdGuardHome` dir etc. Simply just copy the file to `/adguardhome` and set that to the entrypoint.\r\n\r\nThe above should allow for a container that only contains the binaries and the ssl certificates. And while using Alpine often is better than using alternative base images, the above massively reduces attack surface compared to even alpine linux, and further prevents vulnerabilities such as the recent CVE-2019-5021. There are multiple ways of debugging that. There's a tool called injecto though that hasn't been updated in a while, alternatively you can get your hands dirty and run other containers in the same namespace, giving you full access to the adh image. There are also tools like docker dive which allow you to inspect layers for an image.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, considering it's the only binary, most debugging can be done using the logs which obviously can be retrieved using the docker logs command.  Right now Adguard just fwd the DNS requests to \"public\" DNS of our choice.\r\nIt would be nice to have the ability to call directly to the root servers acting as a DNS resolver.\r\nI think it will improve privacy a lot but maybe it wont be as fast, but is a tradeoff  Maybe you already know this list, but it can give you some idea of what solutions are out there.\r\nhttps://doh.defaultroutes.de/implementations.html\r\n hi there\r\n\r\ni had similar thinks when i start with ibksturm.synology.me....\r\na) being a resolver to root\r\nb) being a forwarder\r\n\r\ni choose a combination. opennic i running with nsd a copy of root and iana forward\r\n\r\nmy reasons are:\r\n- opennic local copy: cause being a duplicate of the hole alt. dns system and it isn\u2018t speed \u201eimportant\u201c\r\n- iana forwards because\r\n - speed, forwarding is much faster than resolving (i use resolving only as fallback)\r\n - privacy reason, all forwards are over tls 853. unbound change in the actualy modified config over 6 dns server, where the fastest ist weighted to 40%.\r\n i also wrote months ago to the iana guys a mail where i could get encryted root server. the answer was that all root servers are for reason unencrypted and thats at the moment not a option in their roadmap\r\n- les data traffic. if you\u2018ve got over 1.5 mio request / 24h you will think about.... keynote: myisp had also think about and installed on street side a new fiberswitch station \ud83d\udc4d it seams that i crushed hole neighbourhood :) \r\n\r\nback to original question\r\n\r\ni think it would be better for future of project if you wrote it complettly newly on Go.\r\n\r\n+ you \u201e know\u201c better what your code do\r\n+ you could splitt it into a side project as dnsproxy\r\n+ as you wrote its easyier to compile\r\n\r\n- there could be some handmade security bugs where unbound guys are well known\r\n\r\n\r\nmaybe if i thinking loud, is there any reference on unbound websides? or maybe theguys from unbound had allready done a Go project. Wrote them a mail  wouldn costs a lot... just trying to help you guys\r\n\r\ngreets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n @ameshkov da, thats what i would say ^^ \r\n\r\nso what i mean generally, maybe the unbound people could / should / would peer review your opensourcecode\r\n\r\n\r\nmaking a more secure internet belongs to every one thats more than i know ^^ anyway i have go back to business  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I have configure upstreams DNS servers with this\r\n[/abcd.duckdns.org/]192.168.1.220\r\nwhen I resolver this abcd.duckdns.org it gives me an error page\r\nIt's a website hosted in my network I want local queries to redirect to the IP.\r\n\r\nWhen I test the servers I get this error \r\nServer \"[/abcd.duckdns.org/]192.168.1.220\": could not be used, please check that you've written it correctly\r\n\r\n192.168.1.220 it's a nginx server. with piholes wortks.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nIt should give me the website behind\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nwhen I resolver this abcd.duckdns.org it gives me an error page\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\nRunning docker latest version\r\n Now I get this error\r\n\r\nServer \"/abcd.duckdns.org/192.168.1.220\": could not be used, please check that you've written it correctly\r\n\r\nError: control/set_upstreams_config | wrong upstreams specification: address /abcd.duckdns.org/192.168.1.220: missing port in address | 400\r\n\r\nAnd if I put  /abcd.duckdns.org/192.168.1.220:443\r\n\r\nError: control/set_upstreams_config | wrong upstreams specification: /abcd.duckdns.org/192.168.1.220 is not a valid IP | 400\r\n\r\n @lordraiden hi!\r\nThe right way to specify upstream per host is [/abcd.duckdns.org/]192.168.1.220\r\n\r\nI think that you get an error because it's the only one upstream server which you specified. It means that you should specify any other upstream to resolve all queries except for abcd.duckdns.org Sorry I feel stupid right now\r\n\r\nThis is my configuration, it doesn't matter if I use [] or not it doesnt work, I get the same errors\r\nWhat I want is adguard home to resolve 192.168.1.220 when this domain is called abcd.duckdns.org. How can I do this?\r\n@ameshkov @admitrevskiy \r\n\r\n> 1.1.1.1\r\n9.9.9.9\r\n/abcd.duckdns.org/192.168.1.220\r\ntls://1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com\r\nhttps://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query @lordraiden I don't understand what's going on, your configuration with `[]` looks correct :)\r\n\r\nLet's clarify: your goal is to resolve `abcd.duckdns.org` with `192.168.1.220` upstream `or` you'd like to be redirected to `192.168.1.220` when try to resolve `abcd.duckdns.org`?\r\n\r\n-If you try to reach the goal \u21161 - please, send me verbose logs (run AGHome with -v option)\r\n-If you try to reach the goal \u21162 - upstream-per-domain specification is not the right place to do it @admitrevskiy \r\nI'm trying n\u00ba2, how can I do it? Try the following:\r\n\r\n-Go to `Filters` -> `Custom filtering rules`\r\n-Add this rule: `192.168.1.220 abcd.duckdns.org`\r\n\r\nPlease, let me know if something goes wrong. @admitrevskiy  \r\nIt doesn't work, if I do a nslookup it says that the domain doesn't exits, in pihole can be done by editing the settings with this solution\r\nhttps://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/howto-using-pi-hole-as-lan-dns-server/533\r\n\r\n@ameshkov this is must have and it should be available to configure in the interface For some reason now it works. Thanks a lot for the patience. \r\nBTW nice update the 0.96, I hope this proyect will continue growing, better analytics would be awesome @ameshkov @admitrevskiy \r\nOne more thing, when I add the rule in the filter log appears as something blocked by the filter while actually is just a redirection, maybe you could change in the interface the way this is treated and change the color from red to blue or something\r\n\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17175395/59145711-0624be00-89e8-11e9-8a3d-2bf23a1e08d6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Load this block list https://dbl.oisd.nl/\r\n2. this is blocked raw.githubusercontent.com\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should not block it because that domain is not in that list.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAllow\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n\r\nRunning in docker latest version\r\n I had this same issue. It's because entries in a list are treated as regex and that list contains \"ntent.com\", which matches \"raw.githubusercontent.com\".\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have better handling of lists in this format.   <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

I think it's better to change `/remove_url` input format to json.\r\n2. fix `/add_url` openapi format  I currently have many devices configured on my local network and it would be great if AdGuard would be allow me to configure these hostname/ip mappings and resolve them so that I can use the hostnames in my browser rather than IPs.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to add these and mount them in /etc/hosts so that they are resolved in the AdGuard UI, but the DNS server does not honour these.  Also, if they are added in the filters section then they resolve but appear as blocks domains.\r\n\r\nUsing Pi-hole I could either mount a separate dnsmasq config or override /etc/hosts.\r\n\r\nI am also running this in docker on a Synology NAS using MACVLAN network driver.  \"...will check if domain is blacklisted by the browsing security web service.

Currently, AdGuard Home has only one configuration for every client. It'd be nice if we could define different configurations based on the requested subdomain. For example:\r\n\r\nclient1.adguarddns.com loads filters and/or settings as configured for client1\r\nclient2.adguarddns.com loads filters and/or settings as configured for client2\r\netc.\r\n\r\nwith\r\nadguarddns.com being the default.\r\n  @ameshkov I just saw the latest commits regarding support for \"clients\"  (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/727). Seems like now it's a lot easier to add subdomain-based client configurations... basically, we would need to add a textfield to add a subdomain in the client configuration, and in the backend parse the [Host request header](https://godoc.org/net/http#Request.Host). Of course, added logic would be needed, for example to prevent using the same subdomain for two different clients.  Can it support DHCPv6 RA+SLAAC Vote +1 vote +1 vote+1 vote +1  > Command-line flag\r\n\r\nI have some doubts whether it's really necessary:\r\n* Can't we detect at initialization that we're running under Docker?\r\n* Why would user want to click on \"Update Now\" button, if he already knows that AGH under Docker can't be updated this way?\r\n* Can't we use configuration setting instead?  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->  When AdGuardHome DNS is into the MAC it gets kicked out or erased or deleted when the MAC connects to VPN.

It's like there are no bootstrap DNS servers at all.\r\n\r\nIf I place a tls://1.1.1.1 in Upstream DNS - I got resolve and adguard processes the system's DNS queries. Windows 10 64 bit Still does not work, this issue should not be closed.\r\n\r\nWhen SYSTEM resolver is set to AGH (127.0.0.1), AGH will not resolve the host names of Upstream DNS servers. Bootstrap DNS servers not working in this case.\r\n Steps to reproduce:\r\n1. Set up AGH with the following Upstream DNS servers:\r\nhttps://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query\r\nsdns://AgUAAAAAAAAAACAe9iTP_15r07rd8_3b_epWVGfjdymdx-5mdRZvMAzBuQ5kbnMuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ0vZXhwZXJpbWVudGFs\r\n\r\n2. Set your desired bootstrap DNS servers.\r\n3. Save settings.\r\n4. Open network card's properties, go to TCP/IP and set DNS servers to: 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\n5. System immediately looses DNS.\r\n6. Open DNS serttings of AGH and click: \"Test upstreams\".\r\n7. You will see red popups showing \"Unable to resolve xyz whatever\".\r\n\r\nThis indicates the bootstrap DNS servers are NOT USED AT ALL to resolve hostnames for upstream DNS servers. @Onepamopa Can you attach new logs with v0.96-hotfix? @szolin I will do that tomorrow. I see what is going on - it's related to IPv6. I have IPv6 disabled on my network card, but adguard tries to connect using IPv6:\r\n`2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#256 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): Dialing to [2606:4700::6810:f8f9]:443\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#178 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): dialer failed to initialize connection to [2606:4700::6810:f8f9]:443, in 10000 milliseconds, cause: dial tcp [2606:4700::6810:f8f9]:443: i/o timeout\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#178 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): Dialing to [2606:4700::6810:f9f9]:443\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#58 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): dialer failed to initialize connection to [2606:4700:4700::1111]:853, in 10001 milliseconds, cause: dial tcp [2606:4700:4700::1111]:853: i/o timeout\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#58 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): Dialing to [2606:4700:4700::1001]:853\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#43 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): dialer failed to initialize connection to [2606:4700:4700::1001]:853, in 10001 milliseconds, cause: dial tcp [2606:4700:4700::1001]:853: i/o timeout\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#43 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): Dialing to [2606:4700:4700::1111]:853\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#49 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): dialer failed to initialize connection to [2606:4700:4700::1111]:853, in 10000 milliseconds, cause: dial tcp [2606:4700:4700::1111]:853: i/o timeout\r\n2019/06/13 17:11:13 19420#49 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): Dialing to [2606:4700:4700::1001]:853`\r\n\r\nI suggest an option to enable/disable IPv6. @szolin @ameshkov  Please attach the complete log, we need to see why there are no IPv4 addresses which AGH can use. @Onepamopa   Hi!\r\nAdGuard Home safe on public internet?\r\nI want use without VPN, but i'm worried about DNS Amplification and other vulnerabilities.\r\nI have a reason to be worry, or AdGuardHome safe on public internet?\r\n I believe DNS-over-TLS and/or DNS over HTTPS mitigate spoofing and amplification for DoS.

To better understand and analyze the traffic for that specific client by looking at the log and the \"top queried domains\" and \"top blocked domains\".\r\n\r\nYes, I could filter the requests and when #636 is fixed it would even be easier. However, enabling protection/logging for a single client would make ALL statistics about that client only, giving you a better overview of what's going on, traffic wise, on that client.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? But this is not just about the logging itself... The dashboard also contains some interesting information to understand what's going on with a particular client on your network. Like the top most accessed/blocked domains. If you improve logging filtering in a way that I can see all that information (not just access/block logging) in a single screen, that would work for me too.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really matters to me _how you do it_, as long as I can filter everything (access/block log, dashboard/statistics and etc) for a particular client so I can have a better overview of what's going with that client on my network. That's my feature request :)  ```\r\n$ sudo ./AdGuardHome -s install\r\n$ sudo ./AdGuardHome -s status\r\n2019/05/17 16:58:00 [info] Service control action: status\r\n2019/05/17 16:58:00 [fatal] failed to get service status: the service is not installed\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocalhost audit[1]: SERVICE_START pid=1 uid=0 auid=4294967295 ses=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 msg='unit=AdGuardHome comm=\"systemd\" exe=\"/usr/lib/systemd/systemd\" hostname=? addr=? terminal=? res=success'\r\nlocalhost audit[19480]: AVC avc:  denied  { create } for  pid=19480 comm=\"(uardHome)\" name=\"AdGuardHome.out\" scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:var_log_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0\r\nlocalhost systemd[19480]: AdGuardHome.service: Failed to set up standard output: Permission denied\r\nlocalhost systemd[19480]: AdGuardHome.service: Failed at step STDOUT spawning AdGuardHome: Permission denied\r\nlocalhost systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=209/STDOUT\r\nlocalhost systemd[1]: AdGuardHome.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.\r\n\r\n...\r\nSELinux is preventing (uardHome) from create access on the file AdGuardHome.out.\r\n...\r\n\r\nRaw Audit Messages\r\ntype=AVC msg=audit(1558101329.83:2701): avc:  denied  { create } for  pid=8210 comm=\"(uardHome)\" name=\"AdGuardHome.out\" scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:var_log_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0\r\n\r\n\r\nHash: (uardHome),init_t,var_log_t,file,create\r\n\r\n```  The `AdGuardHome.yaml` config file contains a couple of plain text secrets (like the auth password and SSL certificate private key) but the file is readable by every user on the system.

Also see [issue #742 ](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/742).\r\n\r\nAt least in my non-scientific testing on an Android device, this mode works better than the default NXDOMAIN filtering, as it reduces the number of repeated dns queries.\r\n\r\nIt is enabled by adding `null_filter: true` to the dns section of AdGuardHome.yaml, for example:\r\n```\r\n...\r\ndns:\r\n  bind_host: 0.0.0.0\r\n  port: 53\r\n  protection_enabled: true\r\n  filtering_enabled: true\r\n  null_filter: true\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~Note that also host entries in filter lists with 127.0.0.1 will be answered with the unspecified address. This is intentional as 0.0.0.0 seems more compatible accross different operation systems than 127.0.0.1.~~\r\n\r\nLastly, an option for this feature would still have to be added to the UI frontend. I had some difficulty adding the React code to my Goland project for debugging.. :p # [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#743](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/7d2df263359c95d8e31e0319d0d15c93e4ceb886?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.03%`.\n> The diff coverage is `100%`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=W2NOcPrY5v&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master     #743      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   29.84%   29.87%   +0.03%     \n==========================================\n  Files          31       31              \n  Lines        4292     4294       +2     \n==========================================\n+ Hits         1281     1283       +2     \n  Misses       2863     2863              \n  Partials      148      148\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage \u0394 | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [config.go](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-Y29uZmlnLmdv) | `1.38% <\u00f8> (\u00f8)` | :arrow_up: |\n| [dnsforward/dnsforward.go](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZG5zZm9yd2FyZC9kbnNmb3J3YXJkLmdv) | `68.42% <100%> (+0.25%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `\u0394 = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `\u00f8 = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/743?src=pr&el=footer).

Not sure if the ymal changed? Something in the persistent worked in 94 but not 95\r\n I had time to work on it again. I had to change the interfaces to remove the docker interface. Once I deleted persistent, and used just the Ethernet interface (host ports) then it worked. I dont understand why this works, but it does.   I just want to add to this feature request that you should allow multiple IPs for the identifier and not just one. For instance, I have some clients on my network that make requests both in IPv4 and IPv6 and would love to categorized them both as the same client.\r\n\r\nThere's also another similar situation that is when you're using a VPN to access your home network or redirecting all traffic through your home connection. I have my VPN configured to use the AdGuard DNS server and all clients are identified by the VPN IP instead. So I need at least 2 IPv4 and one IPv6 identifier for a particular client.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the IP field could support a mix of IPv4/IPv6 addresses and you could allow for that field to be a list of IPs, separated by commas, and not just a single IP.\r\n\r\nFood for thought :) I think we can support a list of IP addresses per client, but not in the upcoming release.  We should start with just a single IP per client. Hello!\r\n\r\nThis feature is not working for me in 0.96. The client I have configured is filtered according to global rules (no security module, no parental controls and no enforced Safe Search), even though I set client to this:\r\n\r\n![2019-06-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46295914/59053620-1fb3f180-8892-11e9-9186-5623c6a8b37f.png)\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue or is there anything wrong on my end?\r\n\r\n\r\n > \r\n> \r\n> I think we can support a list of IP addresses per client, but not in the upcoming release.

Dobri dem Guys\r\n\r\nan hour ago i had an idear about resolvers under the shower\r\n\r\n\r\nidear:\r\n\r\ni think there should 2 option\r\n\r\na) default servers as now (doh cloudflare and maybe tls / doh / dnsc quad9) without user interogation\r\n\r\nb) extended\r\n- inputfield as it is now\r\n- klick by multiplechoise list (ordered by plain udp /plain tcp/ dnscrypt / doh / tls)\r\n\r\nmaybe with selectboxes dnssec, filters and protocol\r\n\r\nfrank @jedisct1 got some knowledge from dnscrypt-proxy about filtering\r\n\r\nok if i thinking forward, with this idear, there should be one or more public lists with server which you could link to... example dnsprivacy.org or dnscrypt-resolvers...\r\n\r\nmaybe the baselist are in a equal format as frank do it... so people could put their servers on frank lists and you link  (dnsc, doh) to it and / or you maintain your own list (dnscrypt / doh / tls)\r\n\r\njust thinking loud, maybe its an option, maybe not :)\r\n\r\nlet us talk about\r\n\r\ngreets and happy easter monday pretty cool!\r\n\r\nyeah somethink like that i\u2018d think about, but in a more \u201eincludet\u201c way as i wrote up there \ud83e\udd29\r\n\r\nb) any ootions somebody could put more dns server into the list? or could the list autosync in parts with dnscrypt (work do twice makes zero)\r\n\r\n yeah exact, just in other words but exactly what i mean hi there\r\n\r\ni did some work an ad some doh, dot and dnsc servers\r\n\r\nhope they are usefull   AdGuard Home is a DNS filter.\r\nAs this is not complete filtering solution, several features are not applicable for filter rules (i.e. cosmetic filters, 3rd party stuff etc.). \r\nCould you explain in the new article how to build own filters and how to use regular expressions for this purpose?\r\nI understand that AdGuard has well documentation on their web site, but as I mentioned above only DNS-related filtering may be applied for AG Home, and we need to know exact scope.\r\nThanks.  Containers security best practices say we should not run anything as root. In fact, this is actually enforced in some OpenStack distributions.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes AdguardHome run as `nobody`.\r\n\r\nA drawback is that volume writing will happen as non-root (obviously), and thus file permissions will show their ugly head in the face of the user when she tries to mount a local directory in the container.  \r\nSince the target user is advanced enough to use Docker, I think this is a reasonable tradeoff. # [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#720](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/cedab695c2819eaca8e49e069af9b613a0023abb?src=pr&el=desc) will **increase** coverage by `0.01%`.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=W2NOcPrY5v&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@            Coverage Diff             @@\n##           master     #720      +/-   ##\n==========================================\n+ Coverage   29.83%   29.84%   +0.01%     \n==========================================\n  Files          31       31              \n  Lines        4294     4292       -2     \n==========================================\n  Hits         1281     1281              \n+ Misses       2864     2863       -1     \n+ Partials      149      148       -1\n```\n\n\n| [Impacted Files](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720?src=pr&el=tree) | Coverage \u0394 | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [dnsfilter/dnsfilter.go](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720/diff?src=pr&el=tree#diff-ZG5zZmlsdGVyL2Ruc2ZpbHRlci5nbw==) | `70.2% <0%> (+0.26%)` | :arrow_up: |\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `\u0394 = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `\u00f8 = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/720?src=pr&el=footer).

Read the [comment docs](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/pull-request-comments).\n Beware putting a default `AdGuardHome.yml` in the container will be useless if the user mounts `/opt/adguardhome/config` (which is recommended to persist configuration).\r\nWhy do you need root on first run? I've cleaned up a bit the Dockerfile and removed the `nobody` user for now. Also introduced a sample docker-compose file for easy copy'n'paste.\r\nThe binary and directories are still owned by `nobody`, which is usually not a problem for the `root` user. ;-) The `setcap` ensures we can easily change the runtime user after first launch.\r\n\r\nSo now there is no functional difference compared to the currently published Docker version (100% backward compatible), but it enables more flexibility where it matters.  Extremely sorry for asking such a question, but I use adguardhome on linux mint. Sometimes, I need to have my isp dns , that unsecured cause when my data cap end , it prompted me to recharge . But with adguard , the prompt or redirection doesn't happen. It happen only when using my isp default dns , that unsecure, plain . Also sometimes , it is required for some local stuffs like streaming ,accessing certain website or  features. \r\n\r\nSo my basic question is how to disable adguardhome or dns for \r\n\r\n1. Quickly . With a few clicks.\r\n\r\n2. For a short period of time.\r\n\r\nDoing  just  ,  \" ./AdGuardHome -s stop \" ( without the bracket of course) , stops the adguardhome service, but my net stops. I have to either enable or start  systemd-resolved , then restart my computer. I haven't found any reliable , fast ,easy way to quickly stop, disable for a short time & then enable it  again. \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for your free service in advacnce.  Does AdGuardHome support dns over quic ? \r\n\r\nIf not , can we have dns ove quic support  ? \r\n\r\n\r\nI read that dns over quic is fast , with low latency . It is basically dns over udp but secure.    <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\nadd dns \r\n\r\npanic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference\r\n[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x2 pc=0x89eb26]\r\n\r\ngoroutine 54 [running]:\r\ngithub.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).logDNSMessage(0xc00008d200, 0x0)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.12.0/proxy/proxy.go:903 +0x26\r\ngithub.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleDNSRequest(0xc00008d200, 0xc001974500, 0x1f, 0x1f)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.12.0/proxy/proxy.go:851 +0x178\r\ngithub.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket(0xc00008d200, 0xc00197c100, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0xc0e340, 0xc001925a40, 0xc001571b80)\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.12.0/proxy/proxy.go:583 +0x219\r\ncreated by github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).udpPacketLoop\r\n        /home/travis/gopath/pkg/mod/github.com/!adguard!team/dnsproxy@v0.12.0/proxy/proxy.go:553 +0x322\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15966687/56058463-09a71a80-5d94-11e9-92f0-d5f3f08058ab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n<!--- drag and drop, upload or paste your screenshot to this area-->\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| (e.g. v1.0)\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| (System/Router/IoT)\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| (e.g. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)\r\n| Operating system and version:| (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04.1)\r\nCENTOS 7 X64 Sorry, I found the problem.

Test depends on protocol (HTTP/HTTPS/TCP/UDP/etc.);\r\n2. ICMP may be measured, not sure about others protocols;\r\n3. Idea sounds good, looks like some simplified PfR (Performance Routing);\r\nbut:\r\n1. Realization of the check may be difficult enough;\r\n2. Fastest response doesn't guarantee fastest service (back-end may be overloaded, for example);\r\n3. Anyway, it must be a user's choice to turn this feature on.  The Project \"SmartDNS\" 's document in English\r\nhttps://github.com/pymumu/smartdns/blob/master/ReadMe_en.md  Just a quick Update & a Question. \r\n\r\nIts not just large filter lists but when the yaml gets large as it has:\r\n\r\nBLOCKLIST (Entries added here from gui block command)\r\ne.g ||baddomain.com^ \r\n\r\nREGEX \r\ne.g /^(.*adwords).*/ # \r\n\r\nWHITELIST\r\ne.g @@||gooddomain.com^$important\r\n\r\nIt be better if GUI had three sections (one for each) and saved in files rather than yaml.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I assume that as Filters and hosts blocklists supports basic adblock rules and hosts files syntax that I could copy the entries from YAML, put them into files and add to Filters and hosts Since we are on topic of host files, would also be nice if you can add host aliases like in normal host files ex:\r\n192.168.1.1 router.loc  router.com\r\n\r\nI have many local resources that have different names. Thank you all again :)  nice, is this already live? If yes how do we use it. by default AdGuard Simplified Domain Names filter enable its use around 20mb\r\nafter enable this two filter( hpHosts - Ad and Tracking servers only,MalwareDomainList.com ) it goes to 42mb,imagine if add more filter!\r\nits can not optimized with bellow link?\r\nhttps://github.com/jedisct1/fpst\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have opened two issues in these past days that I assumed it was a problem with AdGuard and not my fault, but it actually was my fault (kinda). I'm referring to these two:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/703\r\n- https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/709\r\n\r\nBoth were caused due to me AdGuard Home setup. I'm using this in a Synology NAS with Docker and after a basic observation of memory usage I decided to impose a memory limit of **128MB** to AdGuard's container (as I do to all my containers). This limit was not enough and caused the issues above. Removing the limit, and the problems mentioned on those issues don't even exist (sorry about that guys).\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\n\r\nA default installation of AdGuard Home under Docker does not that much memory, 128MB seemed just fine. However, as soon as I added Energized Ultimate Protection list (a 19MB list with more than 800,000 rules), the container memory usage spiked to **more than 300MB**. Doesn't feel right, does it?\r\n\r\nAlso, at the time of writing my AdGuard Home container is using 281MB and for testing purposes I'm adding `||example.org^` as a custom filter rule. Pressed the \"Apply\" button and the container just spiked to **more than 500MB**. What!? Removed the filter, pressed the \"Apply\" button again and memory usage is still above 500MB.\r\n\r\nYou can now understand why was having issue #703 (while uploading such large list) and issue #709 (while adding/removing custom filter rules) with just 128MB allocated to this container.\r\n\r\nFor now I just disabled the memory limit for this container but I'm not feeling very comfortable with this, especially judging by the observations above. I'm afraid AdGuard Home container's will use too much memory of my host and bring it to a halt (Docker itself uses all the memory from the host if it can, there's not limits).\r\n\r\nSo, two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is this memory usage under Docker considered normal or could this be memory leaks? (issue title)\r\n2. What's a sensible memory limit one could use for AdGuard Home Docker container? I mean RAM. I have same problem, after 30 minute adguarhome container crashing. Sorry for the delay, was on vacation.\r\n\r\n> How do you measure it?\r\n\r\nMemory usage is reported by the Docker engine.\r\n\r\n> And one more question -- what exact format of the list did you use?\r\n\r\nAdBlock Filter > \r\n> \r\n> > AdBlock Filter\r\n> \r\n> This is the most \"heavy\" format, hosts format will use much less.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"heavy\"? AdBlock Filter takes 19M while RAW hosts takes 23M.\r\n > In the case of hosts files, the structure is a trivial map while for adblock syntax the structure is much more complicated -> more heavy on ram.\r\n\r\nHow heavy on RAM would that be once #714 is done? > Twice less heavy, but anyway, adblock-based filter list will be heavier than the hosts file-based.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, is there any benefit in using an adblock based filter list or the support for that format is available just for feature completeness and/or flexibility?

pihole. Yaml file contains all rules, links, private key etc  I don't see a reply privately option here either ? Thanks but prefer not too. \r\n\r\nI added whitelist rules, regex and all was ok. Then started to add filter lists and only did about 10 and it died. And it won't restart. \r\n Any idea how I can get it to restart? I guess delete the .txt \r\n\r\nOn another topic it takes ages to set up through GUI. It would be easier if there was a way to add a lists of filter files, whitelist files, regex.  OK will do.\r\nFYI it was clean build and was setting up;\r\nWas trying to add 50+ filter links ( which would result in approx 2m when cleaned)\r\n100 regex lines\r\n100+ whitelist lines\r\n100+ blacklist lines I thought that it was having a number of lists or those with malformed entries that caused the issue but seems that even [one host list](https://github.com/no-replies/blocklist/raw/master/gravity) will do it. sorry yes I should've mentioned. It gets converted by a script. But you have got me thinking; Possible causes:\r\nError Adblock list / error in regex\r\nhost file in .txt being added to Adblock list because its a .txt even though in host format well most are 0.0.0.0 but a few are 127.0.0.1 but that should be ok\r\n\r\nfor example here is another large'ish 127.0.0.1 which will cause the error\r\n [@ookangzheng](https://gitlab.com/ookangzheng/dbl-oisd-nl/raw/master/dblzero.txt)  Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm using Adguard DNS servers ( 176.103.130.130\r\n176.103.130.131 ) with my WiFi modem configuration i.e 192.168.1.1.\r\n\r\nEverything was working fine but of late it is giving trouble with legit sites.\r\n\r\nFor example this legit mobile site is not opening with Adguard DNS server :  https://www.91mobiles.com/ . I get DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN error on trying to access this site.\r\n\r\nWhat is the issue here? I have checked everything on my end. The site promptly opens up when I use 4g on my phone!\r\n\r\nPlease look into it and rectify the error. This must be happening with other sites as well! @razz100 https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter/pull/59 Why have you closed the thread/issue without resolving it? Ok. Thanks. Pardon my ignorance. Sorry. It is been more than 21 hours, you said few hours, and the issue is still there. I still cannot access 91mobiles.com from your DNS servers.\r\n\r\nHow much you will need to fix it? Thanks. Hi,\r\n\r\nThe issue with the mentioned site Was solved but from today onwards the issue has came back!!\r\n\r\nSite not opening with adguard on!! Opening only after disabiling it!!\r\n\r\nPlease look into it.\r\n\r\nThanks.  I just want to add that the reverse proxy **was not** the cause for the #709 issue (I'll be opening a new issue about the actual problem). Feel free to still make the change to `POST` instead of `PUT` if you think that makes sense. I think \"405\" response code can only occur when proxy server has cached the content we sent.  And when a client tries to execute the same request once again, proxy server fails to respond because PUT method isn't supported for static content.  Normally a proxy shouldn't cache a response to PUT request.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we should disable caching of our response content to API methods (via Cache-Control). In our code we have this:\r\n`http.Error(w, \"This request must be \"+method, http.StatusMethodNotAllowed)`\r\nSo in case someone issues `GET /control/filtering/set_rules` request, we will reply with 405 error.  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

Editing custom filtering rules manually and clicking \"Apply\", returns the same 405 error and my AdGuard Home Docker container crashes. Rules seem to be saved to the config file but it still crashes and returns 405 errors. Yes, I do have a reverse proxy in front of AdGuard (there are no options to configure what's allowed or not). However, I also tested this connected directly to the source IP:PORT, same issue. > Although, I guess we should stick to GET and POST to avoid issues with proxies.\r\n\r\nThat solves it?\r\n\r\nHowever, how do you explain this problem when accessing without the proxy? Actually, I have a different error:\r\n\r\n##### `http://192.168.0.253:3000` (direct connection)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96476/55955439-5c2fec00-5c59-11e9-948a-68cfea7982d3.png)\r\n\r\nThe `PUT` request doesn't even finish here...\r\n\r\n##### `https://adguard.custom.domain/` (nginx reverse proxy)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96476/55955497-81bcf580-5c59-11e9-99df-b2504926058d.png)\r\n\r\nThe `PUT` request returns `405`.\r\n\r\nI just did further testing and I'm almost positive the problem **is not** the reverse proxy...\r\n\r\nI installed AdGuard Home in a second work and I no longer had this issue. In fact, this new container also \"fixed\" issue #703 that I opened a few days ago. This is probably a problem in my network setup.\r\n\r\nWhat's the difference between these 2 containers? Well, this new Docker container network was set to `host` while the other one was using the `macvlan` driver. The idea here was to have a specific IP (different from the container host) for the DNS server:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96476/55956260-723eac00-5c5b-11e9-9f0c-3d83af592210.png)\r\n\r\nThis is probably causing all these issues, I'm just not sure exactly what it is...\r\n Ok, I'm really confused about a lot of things right now and I'm not sure what's going. Please allow me to do further testing and review all this properly. I'll post back my results when I'm bit more sure of what is actually working and what is not. Closing since the actual issue was #713.  When running AdGuard Home on Raspberry Pi in docker container, upon stopping the docker container, AdGuard Home is not saving logs before stopping.

The odd thing is the log file has a large gap which is probably the gap I saw in query log.

Download and extract AdGuardHome_v0.94_linux_amd64.tar.gz, Proxmox LXC Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS container running on a PC.\r\n2. Start and configure the DHCP, \" DHCP server (experimental!) \" \r\n3. \"Enable DHCP server\" is inactive, there is another active DHCP server on the network the default router.1, turning it off doe snot make any difference -  \"Enable DHCP server\" is greyed out and inactive. \r\n![01-AGH-DHCP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4037132/55582714-15ea0280-5718-11e9-8f16-5d5d178baac5.png)\r\n![02-AGH-DHCP-after-check-for DHCP is pressed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4037132/55582729-200c0100-5718-11e9-86ac-2b7296c0de9f.png)\r\n5.

Load any AdGuard Home page.\r\n2. Observe that the `favicon.ico` is not show.\r\n\r\nIt could be relevant that I'm accessing AdGuard Home through a local NGINX reverse proxy that points a specific hostname (HTTPS only) on my network to `<ADGUARD_IP>:3000`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAdGuard favicon should be displayed in browsers tabs.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nAdGuard favicon IS NOT displayed in browsers tabs.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n<!--- drag and drop, upload or paste your screenshot to this area-->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96476/55405423-f1442e00-5551-11e9-9bdb-57ae7fa0eb3e.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| (e.g. v0.94) 1.

Maybe a problem with the machine where I'm installing this originally... Can't think of a reason for causing this though. I also do not see the favicon on Raspberry PI and docker.\r\n\r\n@ameshkov If you log onto my AGHome with link I sent you yesterday in Telegram, you'll notice the icon does not show. @rfgamaral @adrianh-za Hello!\r\nCan you check this once again with the latest AGH version?\r\nIt looks like a network issue, so in order to isolate it, please use `curl` command on the same machine where AGH is running, try it several times, is it 100% reproducible? @szolin \r\n\r\nI do not know how to execute the curl command you require.  Please can you post it for me and then I shall execute it a little later.\r\n\r\nThat said, running 0.95 (no hotfix) the icon is not showing on any browser, be it on my home network or connecting externally.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5121135/56974816-df18d800-6b6f-11e9-859a-8d603aaf810a.png)\r\n Try this command (another user has posted it earlier here):\r\n`curl --user \"username:password\" http://<AGH_IP>:<AGH_PORT>/favicon.ico --output favicon.ico` > \r\n> \r\n> @rfgamaral @adrianh-za Hello!\r\n> Can you check this once again with the latest AGH version?\r\n> It looks like a network issue, so in order to isolate it, please use `curl` command on the same machine where AGH is running, try it several times, is it 100% reproducible?\r\n\r\nUsing the latest here (0.95-hotfix) and it still happens, same as above. Tried running `curl` multiple times, always the same issue:\r\n\r\n> curl: (18) transfer closed with 512 bytes remaining to read Try to set `bind_host: 0.0.0.0` in AdGuardHome.yaml file (so AGH will listen on all network interfaces) and run the same curl command but now using 127.0.0.1 as AGH address?  We'll see whether the issue persists on loopback interface.\r\n\r\n`curl --user \"username:password\" http://127.0.0.1:3000/favicon.ico --output favicon.ico` That command with username/password returns the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100    14  100    14    0     0   3611      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  4666\r\n```\r\n\r\nand without \r\n\r\n```\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100    14  100    14    0     0   3034      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  4666\r\n```\r\n `Total` value should be 15086.  Most likely that you have a wrong IP address in your curl command.  You should use the address that AGH is running on. Unfortunately the IP is correct.  See the putty dump below with IP and docker containers that are running.\r\n\r\n```\r\nLinux RPi-Black 4.14.98-v7+ #1200 SMP Tue Feb 12 20:27:48 GMT 2019 armv7l\r\n\r\nThe programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;\r\nthe exact distribution terms for each program are described in the\r\nindividual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.\r\n\r\nDebian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent\r\npermitted by applicable law.\r\nLast login: Mon Apr 29 22:14:00 2019 from 192.168.10.113\r\n\r\npi@RPi-Black:~ $ curl --user \"######:######\" http://192.168.10.14:3000/favicon.ico --output favicon.ico\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100    14  100    14    0     0   3611      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  4666\r\n\r\npi@RPi-Black:~ $ curl  http://192.168.10.14:3000/favicon.ico --output favicon.ico\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100    14  100    14    0     0   3034      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  4666\r\n\r\npi@RPi-Black:~ $ docker ps -a\r\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES\r\n1ce6b3fddd47        mrhadenough/rpi-socks5-server      \"/socks5 --restart=u\u2026\"   6 days ago          Up 22 hours         0.0.0.0:1080->1080/tcp   socks5-rpi\r\n12c8539b5d7c        adguard/adguardhome:armhf-latest   \"/opt/adguardhome/Ad\u2026\"   6 days ago          Up 26 hours                                  adguardhome\r\n7e74d495e70b        tkoopman/shellinabox-rpi           \"/usr/bin/entry.sh /\u2026\"   2 weeks ago         Up 26 hours         0.0.0.0:4200->4200/tcp   shell-in-a-box\r\n20195a6ea2f4        michaelmiklis/rpi-monitor:latest   \"/usr/bin/entry.sh /\u2026\"   2 weeks ago         Up 26 hours         0.0.0.0:8888->8888/tcp   rpi-monitor\r\n\r\npi@RPi-Black:~ $\r\n```\r\n\r\nand screenshot of same IP address\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5121135/56983612-548ea380-6b84-11e9-8140-e3e8a8e42fce.png)\r\n > \r\n> \r\n> Try to set `bind_host: 0.0.0.0` in AdGuardHome.yaml file (so AGH will listen on all network interfaces) and run the same curl command but now using 127.0.0.1 as AGH address?

Extra thought will need to be put into this to factor in all the possible outcomes though.\r\n\r\nIt's more likely that you won't just be able to trim the top and bottom percentage of DNS request time as there will be other factors that likely come into play to make the calculation accurate per each user. Further discussion will be needed. Maybe you could separate the \"Adguard security web service\" time into separate value as well?  This relates to #691 in respect to the amount of viewable data being requested by users.\r\n\r\nAs the AGH project proceeds, users are requesting large amounts of data to be displayed in a multitude of forms.\r\nTo deal with future ambiguous requests of viewable data I recommend some form of api to deal with these requests and allow users to create and export their own data. > Have you checked this?\r\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/tree/master/openapi\r\n\r\nI have now - That should do the trick just fine. Now to push that information on to the rest of the population. ;)  Hello,\r\n\r\ni've installed Adguard Home 0.94 on my Raspberry Pi 3+ (OS Raspbian). It works well, when i change the DNS- Server in my Fritz!Box 7590 to the Adguard-Server. I have access to my Somfy Tahoma but i've no connection to my Buderus Oil-Heater OUTSIDE my Lan. Normaly, the Oilheater connects to wa2.mz36-qrmzh6.bosch.de and i can access the heater with the Buderus-App \"MyDevice\".\r\n\r\nThe ports 5222 & 5223 are open (is needed say Buderus).\r\n\r\nInsinde my LAN, i can access the Heater. Adguard block something i think.\r\n\r\nNormally, my Miele-Dryer connects to their server (Miele.com) and with the Miele@home-App i can see the status of the dryer. But when i set the DNS to my Adguard-Server is no connection inside and outside my Lan.\r\n\r\nI've unblockrules to both server but this dosn't work. Any ideas why my Somfy Tahoma works and Miele & Buderus not?\r\n\r\nWhat can i do?\r\n\r\nPS: My ISP is Deutsche Telekom.\r\nPPS: Sorry for my bad english ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks, Oli\r\n Hello!\r\nCan you attach logs?  You can use this command to create a log file:\r\n\r\n`grep AdGuardHome /var/log/daemon.log >aghome.log`\r\n\r\nI'll look for requests to miele.com and wa2.mz36-qrmzh6.bosch.de there.  Or you can try to find the necessary information by yourself and send us only the relevant lines.\r\n\r\nAlso, it' would be better if you use `verbose: true` setting in .yaml config file. Hi,\r\nhere are the logs from bosch and miele. I hope,  it can help you to find the failure..\r\n\r\nThanks, Oli\r\n\r\n[miele+bosch.txt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/3035555/miele%2Bbosch.txt)\r\n Hi ameshkov,\r\n\r\ni disabled AGH and its's still the same. No connection with bosch outside my lan. Can it be raspian? Its a brand new clean installaltion. Shouldni unblock with \"@@||wa2-mz36-qrmzh6.bosch.de^\" or what do you mean? That doesn't work :-(. I'va added my DNS from my ISP in the \"Upstream DNS\"-section and in the \" bootstrap DNS\"-section.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why all other work fine but miele and bosch not :-((  Hello, guys. The banner of the update notification still there after I update AdGuardHome from 0.93 to 0.94. Is this kind of bug....\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35817374/55301940-9f2bdb80-5471-11e9-8611-9102cd762aeb.png)\r\n  Hi! I will be nice if Adguard could resolve local names or has de capability to set a domain that can be redirected to a local server there is still this option... look at the manual \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Configuration#upstreams-for-domains\r\n\r\n**Example:** \r\n\r\n`[/yourdomaine/]aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd` many thanks @ibksturm !! I will try and see how it works. do you know If I set my local domain in this way the list of my local computers will show the names instead of IPs?

When installing, during one of the steps, there is a message that says **\"Port 53 is not available for binding -- this will make DNs clients unable to contact AdGuard Home.\"** Putting in 5353 instead doesn't help. No matter what port I use, I get to the next page where I enter my UN and PW, then when I click next I get an error that says \"Error: control/install/configure | Impossible to listen on IP:port 0.0.0.0:53 due to listen udp 0.0.0.0:53: bind: permission denied | 400\" Choosing a different interface doesn't change results either.

I'd say for the most part this can be ignored, when analysing the query log there were a lot of outliers. As a discussion point, would it be worth having an advanced filtering section do you think where we could filter out latency outliers as well as many other things? A good measurement for the \"normality\" is the mode i suppose (instead of the simple average that doesn't consider how many data points are near that value). In addition, it could make sense to add the standard deviation or something similar. But hey, not sure if the average user will be able to interpret that.\r\n\r\nThe first time i saw that my reaction was that it was impossible to understand how much of that time is due to upstream dns resolution and how much to the filtering adguard does (my guess is that the filtering is quite fast and just a small part of the total). > This is the average time spent on processing DNS queries starting at the moment when it enters AGH.\r\n\r\nOkay, so quite a simple calculation with no fancy additions. Thanks.\r\n\r\n> Well, for one, we should add the \"Elapsed time\" column to the query log, or maybe even add detailed timing there (i.e. see timing in Chrome's developer tools).\r\n\r\nI like the way you're heading there however I feel we're moving into a field now where AGH is going to need a basic and detailed view in the Query Log (and eventually other sections).\r\n\r\nIf you do add this data view, I can see a lot of other requests being made for viewable data so it might end up being easier in the long run to create a system within AGH for users to create their own data exports based off wildcards.\r\n\r\nI'll raise these 2 suggestions as issues regardless so they're not lost.\r\n\r\n> What else would you suggest?\r\n\r\nI think a [trimmed mean](https://www.easycalculation.com/statistics/learn-trimmed-mean.php) should come into play for the average processing time, instead of simply the mean of all DNS requests.\r\n\r\nBasically, trim the top and bottom (for theories sake)20% of DNS request time data and give the mean on the remainder. Extra thought will need to be put into this to factor in all the possible outcomes though.\r\n\r\nI'll raise the idea as an issue for discussion as I think this is something that could be improved on.\r\n > Let's continue the discussion here and then file feature requests / tasks.\r\n> \r\n> Just throwing ideas for now, here's what can be possibly useful:\r\n> \r\n>     Min, max, stddev, median values (not sure how to display all these without users freaking out).\r\n>     Stats per upstream\r\n>     Detailed timing (what part of the time was spent on filtering, querying upstream, filtering, querying browsing security and parental control web services)\r\n> \r\n> Also, there was a feature request about prometheus endpoint, it seems relevant to this discussion: #516 .\r\n\r\nIn regards to calculating processing time I think simplification should be the focus when designing a product to cater to the the general public.\r\n\r\nWith simplicity in mind, having a 1-line number like you do now is about as simple as it gets, however we are seeing inaccuracies.\r\nAfter thinking on this a bit I can think of 2 ways to attack this and they can both actually work together.\r\n\r\n1. A 1-line calculation based off all the values you've mentioned with a hover overlay (?) of the statistic breakdown for that calculation.\r\n2. A line graph displaying x=query processing time(ms), y=interval (selectable by user). Of course, a calculation would have to come into play here as each interval on the graph could potentially have thousands of queries. The 1-line calculation would come in handy here as well, not only displaying the details from the 1-line calculation but the amount of queries at that time as well.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"569\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-02 at 19 47 02\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6005161/55393267-79afd800-552c-11e9-86a3-b0358e53dbb9.png\">\r\n\r\nI personally like the combination of both these ideas together, it's user friendly and provides all the extra information for the tech nerds.\r\n\r\nFor an incredibly well put together presentation of similar data, see [Discord's status page](https://discord.statuspage.io/), provided by [Statuspage](https://www.statuspage.io/powered-by).\r\nThis is a paid service, however there are many other [open source solutions](https://cachethq.io/) which could be utilised for your own use.\r\n\r\nThoughts? > Generally, I like the idea. Doing all this will require a serious rework of the stats and the dashboard so we should do it in smaller steps.\r\n> \r\n> Here's what I see in the end (this is the ideal scenario, I just want to see the end goal at this point):\r\n> \r\n> 1. Calculate detailed stats per upstream (requests count, detailed timing, avg/min/max/stdev values)\r\n> 2. `DNS Queries` value should have a hover-triggered popover with per-upstream queries count. For example:\r\n>    ```\r\n>    tls://1.1.1.1: 123123\r\n>    tls://1.0.0.1: 32121\r\n>    ```\r\n> 3. Avg. processing time should also have a popover with smth like this (I am listing everything here, but we'll need to find a way to fit it properly):\r\n>    ```\r\n>    tls://1.1.1.1 latency: 123ms\r\n>    tls://1.0.0.1 latency: 321ms\r\n>    Browsing security web service: 123ms\r\n>    Parental control web service: 422ms\r\n>    Filtering DNS queries: 1ms\r\n>    ```\r\n> 4. Add \"processing time\" chart to the dashboard.\r\n>    We could also unite the current four small charts in a single one, smth like this: https://uploads.adguard.com/up04_7pvnw_Area_Chart_Example_-_JSFiddle.png\r\n\r\nI agree on all points, and I know the UI designer is going to do a fantastic Hulk green job with it. ;)\r\n\r\nIt was never going to be an easy solution, but rather a long term solution I could definitely see AGH ending up with in the end (depending on what the end result desired is, AIO package?).\r\n\r\nI'm happy with that result - unless anyone else wants to chime in, I'd consider this ready to be give a label/priority. I'll keep the conversation going.\r\nWhat kind of strange behavior? Why such a huge time lag?\r\n\"Average processing time | 129215.53\" > I'll keep the conversation going.\r\n> What kind of strange behavior? Why such a huge time lag?\r\n> \"Average processing time | 129215.53\"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of factors that come into play with this. As it's an average processing time a high latency is not a direct correlation with an issue.\r\nFor example, let's say you have 5 requests:\r\n\r\n- 20ms\r\n- 23ms\r\n- 10ms\r\n- 50ms\r\n- 20,000ms\r\nThe average of these 5 requests would be 4103ms. Here you see the average processing time appears high, however likely due to 1 timeout request or slow request, when removed there's actually no issue at all with the performance of, in this case, AdGuard Home.  As you can see from the AdGuardHome.yaml export below, only 1 of the 4 filters that come default with AdGuardHome have a name set.\r\nI'd suggest adding a name for the remaining 3.\r\nThe list of names should be:\r\n\r\n1. AdGuard Simplified Domain Names filter\r\n2. AdAway default blocklist\r\n3. hpHosts - Ad and Tracking servers only\r\n4. MalwareDomainList.com Hosts List\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilters:\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt\r\n  name: AdGuard Simplified Domain Names filter\r\n  id: 1\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://adaway.org/hosts.txt\r\n  name: \"\"\r\n  id: 2\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://hosts-file.net/ad_servers.txt\r\n  name: \"\"\r\n  id: 3\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt\r\n  name: \"\"\r\n  id: 4\r\n``` I solve this problem with the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- AdGuardHome/filter.go.orig\r\n+++ AdGuardHome/filter.go\r\n@@ -236,7 +236,9 @@\r\n \r\n \t\t\tlog.Info(\"Updated filter #%d.

After doing a wipe of my Raspberry Pi I have been unable to get the Pi(AGH) to act as a DHCP server.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Enable DHCP  post-setup on AGH\r\n2. Disable router DHCP server\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nAdGuardHome to act as DHCP server.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nInternet and AGH is inaccessible.\r\nCouldn't listen to 192.168.178.60:68, cause: listen udp4 192.168.178.60:68: bind: address already in use\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1195\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-29 at 05 11 32\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6005161/55185950-61873400-518d-11e9-8dd8-2cf5926c565d.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1177\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-03-29 at 05 11 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6005161/55185954-64822480-518d-11e9-9a1b-dfb343914cb1.png\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n```\r\nAdGuard.yaml\r\nbind_host: 0.0.0.0\r\nbind_port: 80\r\nauth_name: pi\r\nauth_pass: \r\nlanguage: \"\"\r\ndns:\r\n  bind_host: 0.0.0.0\r\n  port: 53\r\n  protection_enabled: true\r\n  filtering_enabled: true\r\n  blocked_response_ttl: 10\r\n  querylog_enabled: true\r\n  ratelimit: 20\r\n  ratelimit_whitelist: []\r\n  refuse_any: true\r\n  bootstrap_dns:\r\n  - 1.1.1.1:53\r\n  all_servers: true\r\n  parental_sensitivity: 13\r\n  parental_enabled: false\r\n  safesearch_enabled: false\r\n  safebrowsing_enabled: true\r\n  upstream_dns:\r\n  - https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query\r\n  - tls://dns.adguard.com\r\ntls:\r\n  enabled: false\r\n  server_name: \"\"\r\n  force_https: false\r\n  port_https: 443\r\n  port_dns_over_tls: 853\r\n  certificate_chain: \"\"\r\n  private_key: \"\"\r\nfilters:\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt\r\n  name: AdGuard Simplified Domain Names filter\r\n  id: 1\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://adaway.org/hosts.txt\r\n  name: \"\"\r\n  id: 2\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://hosts-file.net/ad_servers.txt\r\n  name: \"\"\r\n  id: 3\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt\r\n  name: \"\"\r\n  id: 4\r\nuser_rules:\r\n- \"\"\r\ndhcp:\r\n  enabled: true\r\n  interface_name: eth0\r\n  gateway_ip: 192.168.178.1\r\n  subnet_mask: 255.255.255.0\r\n  range_start: 192.168.178.20\r\n  range_end: 192.168.178.200\r\n  lease_duration: 864000\r\n  icmp_timeout_msec: 0\r\nlog_file: \"\"\r\nverbose: false\r\nschema_version: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| 0.94\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, Fritz Box 7290\r\n| Operating system and version:| Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.8 (stretch)\r\n > Hm, something has occupied port 68.

In terminal, type `netstat -pln`, you should expect to see something along the lines of: `udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*`,\r\n2. In terminal, type `sudo fuser -k 68/udp`, this will close the port allowing AGH to use it for the DHCP server,\r\n3. To confirm, in terminal type `netstat -pln`, step 1's output should be missing,\r\n4. Proceed with enabling DHCP server in AGH.\r\n\r\nConsider this issue completed on my end @ameshkov.

Is there a rough time? Can pay for subscriptions  @ameshkov Now there are applications that can be installed on the route, but I only love AdGuard, I can't wait to use it right away. Thank you very much for developing and sharing such a great adguardhome, it would be great if you have planned time!  With AGH's DHCP server being so close to a stable release a better way of handling query log client searches will be needed on large-scale systems ranging from the tens to the thousands.\r\n\r\nI suggest something along the lines of this - pulled from Stack Overflow while doing some research.\r\n> 1. Create a simple search mechanism where you match the start of a name **(you already have this)**\r\n> 2. Make use of categories (if any are available) and multiple combo boxes to narrow selection\r\n> 3. Same as above, some sort of tree structure with a categorical hierarchy\r\n> 4. A shortcuts control where there is a link or a button for letter of the alphabet (meta-category)\r\n  Possibility of adding enhancement to lockout the web interface for a period of time after username and password has been incorrectly entered a number of times? i would block for 5min after 10 attempts on IP Lvl > Lock just for this client IP, username, or globally?\r\n\r\nNot sure to be honest.  I guess as a first phase, globally would be easiest.  Maybe per IP can be a phase 2 approach?\r\n\r\n  Will enabling parallel queries speed up 2 dns over tls upstreams.\r\n\r\nMaybe an easy one but wondering if being over tls would have a negative impact on it.\r\n\r\nPlus what is the default behavior when parallel queries is not selected with multiple upstreams...   Chrome with `de, de-de, en, en-us` language ordering keeps nagging for a translation from portuguese to german. This would disable any nagging, not sure why they do not respect the html[lang] attribute in this case even the content is clearly english.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-03-26 12-37-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/681514/54996094-aada5680-4fc8-11e9-8ba9-d28b67951c1f.png)\r\n # [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/671?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#671](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/671?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/395ddb7b3caf97c4c281badf0882dc3baf7f3b88?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/671/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=W2NOcPrY5v&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/671?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@          Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master    #671   +/-   ##\n======================================\n  Coverage    32.7%   32.7%           \n======================================\n  Files          27      27           \n  Lines        3914    3914           \n======================================\n  Hits         1280    1280           \n  Misses       2487    2487           \n  Partials      147     147\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/671?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `\u0394 = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `\u00f8 = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/671?src=pr&el=footer).

Hi, sorry for ignoring the issue template but let me just describe what has been broken with the last few releases.\r\nI **really** want to use adguard as my main dns considering all the features it has but while 0.92-hotfixX was barely usable for me, I can't use the last two releases without restarting adguard every hour or so (cpu at 100%, stops responding) and sometimes multiple restarts are needed to make it resolve something.\r\n\r\nTo make it short, with 0.94 i'm seeing a huge number of i/o timeout errors, that start appearing **sometimes at startup, other times after a while (sooner if parallel enabled) and in *extremely(10%)* rare occasions don't manifest themselves at all.**\r\nDescribing/debugging this kind of issues is a bit hard, so bear with me if sometimes the description below will seem a bit incoherent, but I think the root cause can be found in how the connection pool has been implemented.\r\n\r\nThis should be quite easy to replicate even on a laptop or docker container, enabling parallel to reach the breaking point sooner. Testing this on a raspberry with 512mb of ram made seeing these issues easier i guess.\r\n\r\nSetup: I'm running it on a raspberry pi zero (debian stretch, 512mb ram), using the binaries you provide. AdGuardHome configured as a systemd service to start automatically at boot, no other significant services are active.\r\n\r\nLet me recap what i was seeing in the latest releases:\r\n\r\n### 0.92:\r\nIssues with some type of upstream servers, fixed with the hotfixes. \r\nAdguard started by systemd, doesn't resolve anything for 10 minutes or so, then starts working. Most of the times restarting it fixes the issue. Looking at the verbose log i noticed that the first few upstream connections were failing with high RTT (60-120 seconds)\r\n\r\n### 0.93\r\nStill not responding for 10 minutes. After half an hour the process takes 100% of the cpu and stops responding. Restarting helps, but only for another 30 minutes. Didn't test it much in this case, i was just waiting for the next release.\r\n\r\n### 0.94\r\nDid you introduce connection pooling in addition to the parallel query mechanism? \r\nBecause now I can see messages hinting to the fact that an upstream dns connection has been reused.\r\nBut the pooling mechanism appears to be broken.\r\nUnder various circumstances, I can't see connections being reused anymore and a new connection is created every time AdGuardHome receives a new connection. Something that makes adguard unresponsive after a while.\r\n\r\nThis is what i'm seeing in a typical session, with parallel enabled to make it easier to reach the point where the errors appear, but as said above, even with parallel off, sometimes the i/o timeout error you see below will start right away:\r\n\r\n1. It looks like there is some sort of pooling mechanism for upstream dns server connections since sometimes I see these messages:\r\n    \r\n        2019/03/23 08:12:03 5629#372 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.(*TLSPool).Get(): \r\n        Returning existing connection to 9.9.9.9:853 with updated deadLine\r\n    \r\n     BUT after a short while the log is full of normal successful connection attempts without reuse,like if the pool just didn't have any reusable connection available anymore:\r\n    \r\n        2019/03/23 07:56:03 3787#4781 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): \r\n        Dialing to 1.0.0.1:853 2019/03/23 07:56:04 3787#4722 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/upstream.createDialContext.func1(): \r\n        dialer successfully initialize connection to 1.0.0.1:853 in 553 milliseconds\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

But we are not getting rid of these connections correctly since the number of open files reach the allowed limit.\r\n\r\nI would add a mechanism to keep the pool fresh removing closed/stalled/that_are_way_over_the_deadline_you_set/otherwise_dead connections periodically and limit the number of maximum connections that can be created.\r\nIdeally, the pool should contain a number of connections proportional to the number of upstream servers (1,2,3 connection each?) and NOT allow the creation of additional connections. If the pool is full, you wait. Creating additional connections when the pool is full does not make sense.\r\n\r\nClients of the pool should be able to perform request only sequentially (request order must be preserved). The freshness mechanism should flush completely(or by ip) stuck pools (pool that have had all their connection leased to some client for too much time) when no client has been able to get a connection for a reasonable amount of time (e.g. few seconds?).\r\nAlso, loss of overall connectivity should be handled properly (stop the pool from creating connections and flush the old one it has? reply with failures to every dns request adguard receives?)\r\n\r\n With only DoH it either (50/50) works (I'm not sure for how long, but it seems more stable) or not work at all from the beginning with this result for *every* query:\r\n\r\n        2019/03/23 12:19:20 7481#245 [debug] github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/proxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket(): \r\n        error handling DNS (udp) request: talking to dnsUpstream failed, \r\n        cause: all upstreams failed to exchange, \r\n        cause: couldn't do a POST request to 'https://dns.quad9.net:443/dns-query', \r\n        cause: Post https://dns.quad9.net:443/dns-query: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection \r\n        (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) (hidden: couldn't do a POST request to 'https://cloudflare-dns.com:443/dns-query', \r\n        cause: Post https://cloudflare-dns.com:443/dns-query: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection\r\n        (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers))\r\n\r\nAlso, in this case I don't see the familiar \"Returning existing connection\" message anymore.\r\nIf connections are handled differently for DoH, this could be another additional issue. Raspberry Pi Zero W, latest Raspbian Stretch.\r\nYep, the second issue is the one described in #633, unresponding for 5 minutes regardless of DoH/DoT, and then it starts working.\r\nDon't know about the other one since it seems newer.\r\nWill post some comments on the other thread and try to see if I can discover something else.\r\n I had it configured with quad9/cloudflare DoH and after a day or so i've noticed that one of the adguard threads(of 8 listed by Top) was using 100% cpu as usual. \r\nThis is the result of sending a manual SIGSEGV to that thread, could be useful to spot something unusual (i know, a bit crude ;D).\r\nPlease note that it was running since yesterday but 15 minutes or so before sending the SIGSEGV i changed the configuration from parallel to non parallel (this is reflected in the age of some of the goroutines).\r\n\r\n[adguardhome.log.txt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/3012260/agh.log.txt)\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nIn that file there are 238 active goroutines, and most of those are either waiting on a mutex or doing tls or http stuff. I've only 3 clients in that network, if it matters.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the errors i've already listed, this morning i've also seen an error related to the source of randomness being empty (something like \"urandom has no other randoms, waiting 60s\") that i had never seen before (omitted from the log, it happened a few hours before what's shown there).\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"too many open files\" error, the pi zero has some limits that are half of what bigger Raspberry Pis have.\r\n\r\nOn a Pi Zero:\r\n```\r\nraspberrypi:~ $ ulimit -a\r\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) 0\r\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\r\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\r\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\r\npending signals                 (-i) 3780\r\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64\r\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\r\nopen files                      (-n) 1024\r\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\r\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\r\nreal-time priority              (-r) 0\r\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\r\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\r\nmax user processes              (-u) 3780\r\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\r\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\r\nraspberrypi:~ $ ulimit -Hn\r\n1048576\r\nraspberrypi:~ $ ulimit -Sn\r\n1024\r\nraspberrypi:~ $ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\r\n48258\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a Pi3:\r\n\r\n```\r\npi3:~$ ulimit -a\r\ncore file size          (blocks, -c) 0\r\ndata seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited\r\nscheduling priority             (-e) 0\r\nfile size               (blocks, -f) unlimited\r\npending signals                 (-i) 7345\r\nmax locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64\r\nmax memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited\r\nopen files                      (-n) 1024\r\npipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8\r\nPOSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200\r\nreal-time priority              (-r) 2\r\nstack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192\r\ncpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited\r\nmax user processes              (-u) 7345\r\nvirtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited\r\nfile locks                      (-x) unlimited\r\npi3:~$ ulimit -Hn\r\n1048576\r\npi3:~$ ulimit -Sn\r\n1024\r\npi3:~$ cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max\r\n93882\r\n``` Sure! Put it somewhere and I'll try it (arm, not arm64). Testing it now, have you added a 30s timeout somewhere too? The cpu usage drops back to normal levels after 30s when it stalls at 100% (if not, this is something new i noticed now that i look at it closely). For now i'm not seeing improvements, i could try tweaking a bit the limit value (eg. 1000) while running it with verbose and see what happens.\r\nYeah, i agree that this kind of errors could cause a lot of different weird side-effects... > What's your current rlimit_nofile setting value?\r\n\r\nYour 8096, but i didn't check the log for specific errors.\r\n\r\nI'm redoing the tests (starting with 8k and then increasing, even if increasing the limit is just a workaround) with this script that tries to resolve random domains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\nimport socket\r\nimport random\r\nimport string\r\nimport argparse\r\nimport functools\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    print = functools.partial(print, flush=True)\r\n    \r\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Simple stress test for DNS server')\r\n    parser.add_argument('delay', metavar='N', type=float, \r\n                   help='delay between each attempt') #even 0.5 is enough\r\n\r\n\r\n    args = parser.parse_args()\r\n    delay = args.delay\r\n    random.seed()\r\n    i=0\r\n    print(f\"Resolving random domains:\")\r\n    while True:\r\n        i +=1\r\n        addr = ''.join(random.sample(string.ascii_letters + string.digits,16)) + \"dnstest.com\"\r\n        try:\r\n            res = socket.gethostbyname(addr)\r\n        except socket.gaierror:\r\n            pass\r\n        print(\".\",end=\"\")\r\n        if i%20 == 0:\r\n            print(\"\")\r\n        sleep(delay) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact is that it's hard to replicate... at some point it stops resolving, it could be after a few minutes or after hours, something that makes me think about concurrency/resource/stuff_not_closed issues. >So it has been running for 11 hours and I have no issues so far\r\nIf you are using a VPS i have no problem believing that :)\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi Zero W, Raspbian Stretch (the only OS readily available), [package list](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/3021557/pkglist.txt.zip).\r\nRaspberry connected via onboard wifi.\r\n\r\n> Btw, could it be that your RPi may be losing connectivity at some point (networking restart for instance)? This might explain timeout errors.\r\nPossible, and what if adguardhome wasn't able to recover correctly from those errors or from too many errors while communicating with the upstream dns?\r\n\r\nBtw, booted up the pi 2 hours ago (my 4 usual tls upstreams+parallel) and checked now, still blocked at 100% cpu with hundred of threads. ```\r\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo iptables --list\r\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo iptables -t nat --list\r\nChain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n\r\nChain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)\r\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\r\n```\r\nI'm trying to record a video of it, but as expected, when you look at it the issue doesn't happen... Sure, will keep that running to verify that i still have connectivity toward clouflare.\r\nThe router is a dsl modem with a minimal cli/os, don't think it supports complex rules like rate limiting. I won't be able to test anything for a few days, but don't despair, I'll report back soon. @saltama Regarding i/o timeout errors you are experiencing - please take a look at what tcpdump shows for a connection that is hanging.  Or send your tcpdump data and I can try to get the related information from it.  We need to link the AGH logs with TCP connection and see what is really taking so long there. Sorry for not reporting back... I'm verifying if this issue disappeared in Buster too. \r\nFor now it seems possible that's the case.

When allowing AdGuard Home to be used for DHCP, it is impossible to enable it from the Web Interface, as it tells me that the port is already in use.\r\n\r\n`Couldn't listen to 192.168.0.2:68, cause: listen udp4 192.168.0.2:68: bind: address already in use`\r\n\r\nThe port is in use by 0.0.0.0:68. Restarting AdGuard Home after configuring the DHCP still binds port 68 to 0.0.0.0 regardless of the interface selected.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice for the DHCP settings to determine where port 68 will be used, instead of following what the bind address is, since you already ask the user what interface you want the DHCP server to run on.\r\n\r\neg. If I select eth0 which shows me the IPv4 and IPv6 address, clicking on Save should unbind port 68 from 0.0.0.0 and bind it to the IPv4 address when enabled.\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

We would either like to reconfigure it to a different IP or localhost (using SSH tunneling to access it). As the default setup suggests to start a container with `host` network, this would bind to all interfaces, all public ones included.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir -p testconfig\r\ndocker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:80 -v `pwd`/testconfig:/opt/adguardhome/conf --rm adguard/adguardhome \r\n```\r\n\r\nsetup with default values, kill server.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngrep \"bind_host\" testconfig/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n```\r\nshow current setup to be bound to 0.0.0.0.\r\n\r\nReconfigure the server to bind the webinterface to localhost\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsed -i 's/^bind_host: 0.0.0.0/bind_host: 127.0.0.1/' testconfig/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nrestart the server with the same line as above. kill it again. the configuration will be back to 0.0.0.0 exposing the interface on all interfaces despite the fact you just reconfigured them.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the hardcoded `-h 0.0.0.0` argument on the Dockerfile CMD line. From my understanding this value is set to 0.0.0.0 by default in the config.go and this argument should no longer serve any purpose.\r\n\r\nThis would be the easiest fix, a more sophisticated one would be using getenv() in go and configure fixed stuff through docker environment variables.\r\n # [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/649?src=pr&el=h1) Report\n> Merging [#649](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/649?src=pr&el=desc) into [master](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/commit/5b417d9f17e0074dc51a5ff5cf0e6aa6dadff512?src=pr&el=desc) will **not change** coverage.\n> The diff coverage is `n/a`.\n\n[![Impacted file tree graph](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/649/graphs/tree.svg?width=650&token=W2NOcPrY5v&height=150&src=pr)](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/649?src=pr&el=tree)\n\n```diff\n@@           Coverage Diff           @@\n##           master     #649   +/-   ##\n=======================================\n  Coverage   33.05%   33.05%           \n=======================================\n  Files          26       26           \n  Lines        3869     3869           \n=======================================\n  Hits         1279     1279           \n  Misses       2444     2444           \n  Partials      146      146\n```\n\n\n\n------\n\n[Continue to review full report at Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/649?src=pr&el=continue).\n> **Legend** - [Click here to learn more](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/codecov-delta)\n> `\u0394 = absolute <relative> (impact)`, `\u00f8 = not affected`, `? = missing data`\n> Powered by [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/pull/649?src=pr&el=footer).

I'm using Caddy as a frontend proxy + let's encrypt client. \r\nI would like to share the certificate I get from Caddy and use it for DoT instead of updating the certificate every time it gets rotated.\r\n\r\nHaving an option to point to a file in the file system to get the certificate will allow mounting the certificates from Caddy.\r\nYou can see my implementation [here](https://github.com/via-justa/pi-services) If anyone else has that need, I created a wrapper that implements automatic certificates using let's encrypt.\r\nhttps://github.com/via-justa/Adguard-home @ameshkov as of now, I couldn't find a let's encrypt go package that supports let's encrypt DNS-01 challenge so the implementation will be limited to HTTP challenge with them and it won't work if you're behind an FW, that's why I didn't use the builtin packages.\r\nMy next task will be to implement dynamic DNS registration so it would be a one stop shop for everything DNS related.\r\nIf I'll have the time, I'll see if I can get it to work with the acme package (I think that it does support DNS-01 challenge) and let you know. Maybe you'll find some insperation from it :) \r\n Just had the same problem using docker. Not sure integration of LetsEncrypt will solve anything as certbot is widely available and easy to use (and has DNS plugins for many service providers like cloudflare, digitalocean and such).\r\n\r\nI think it would be awesome if you could just provide a path to a chain and key file. Keep the text inputs in the admin GUI, but instead of storing them in the JSON, just save the files into something like `./conf/AdGuardHome.fullchain.pem` and `./conf/AdGuardHome.key.pem` and reload/reread them from there. Maybe even move it to `./ssl` or `./certs`.\r\n\r\nThat solves alot of use cases:\r\n- Static installs can just symlink the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/whatever/*.pem` files\r\n- Docker setups can mount the files in read-only mode through volumes like `/etc/letsencrypt/live/whatever/fullchain.pem:/opt/adguardhome/conf/AdGuardHome.fullchaim.pem:r`\r\n- Manual users can just paste it in the web GUI.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this:\r\n- Make sure you never display the private key in the web GUI, just say if there is one installed.\r\n- Ensure go reloads the file all 24h if you do not want to monitor for file changes. The short lifetime of 90 days on LetsEncrypt produces some insecurities and manual work right now. I agree the way to use SSL certificate file instead of .yaml settings file. As this product is for home users and not for power users like us, it should have a user friendly solution, using a file require the user to understand how certificates works and how to get them and export them in the right way (e.g. pem files) and with the right permissions.\nIntegrating Let's Encrypt will allow the regular user have the benefits of SSL without the need to understand how the mechanism works. Adding a default DDNS service like xip.io or duck dns will also remove the need to create the DNS name and will, in theory, provide the option to enable DoT with a tick box same as enabling the filters or DHCP.\n\nIn my opinion, using a file will be much less user friendly. But I agree that the key should not be visible in clear text via the web interface.\n\nBest regards,\nNir Tal\n\n________________________________\nFrom: alexsannikov <notifications@github.com>\nSent: Tuesday, March 26, 2019 2:04:43 PM\nTo: AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome\nCc: via-justa; Mention\nSubject: Re: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome] Setting certificate from file instead the GUI (#634)\n\n\nI agree the way to use SSL certificate file instead of .yaml settings file.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/634#issuecomment-476619864>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AYh12kkYwFFwITXSe_BI3jWbUkfP60_7ks5vahrrgaJpZM4bnOa8>.\n @via-justa I'm not sure labeling it for home users or integrate LetsEncrypt will solve anything.\r\n\r\nUsing it at home (raspberry/pihole whatever) has no requirement for SSL except outbound and there is no reason why a home user would go through the hassle to encrypt LAN DNS queries.\r\n\r\nLetsEncrypt would just introduce alot of use cases, dependencies and require alot of technical knowledge. You need to setup DDNS, you need to expose the proper ports (if you even can and the router gives you the options) and route them to the correct device. Otherwise the http challenge will not work. Installing or self signing a certificate file is the first tutorial you can find besides propper port forwarding when it comes to guides.\r\n\r\nSwitching the GUI to inputs and storing the input into files would change nothing UI wise right now and give any other user the option to configure the service properly.\r\n\r\n @adrianrudnik You can do it without opening ports, you can use the DNS-01 challenge as you can see in my implementation (I'm running it via caddy client). \r\nIn addition, as far as I can see, you'll need DDNS or a domain and public IP never the less so I'm trying to see how removing the need to worry about the certificate creates use cases and not reduce them. \r\nRunning DoT over a self-signed certificate is as useful as running a pure DNS, that's why the AdGuard guys don't allow it. \r\n\r\nI can think of a few reasons why a home user will want to use DoT and not all of them use Pi, running it on DigitalOcean is as easy if not even easier than running it on a Pi. I can tell you that the main reason I like to implement it is to make sure my ISP is not playing with my DNS results and I'm running it externally.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, if you work with a file, there are too many changes that need to be implemented and too many things that the user can do wrong when providing the certificate (and as it's not via the GUI, he won't get the indication of what's wrong). In my opinion, it's not a good idea but it's not my decision, I'm a user like you :smile:   I really like the ability to select an file, this because i'm having an Nginx server with reverse proxy set to the adguard home. My Nginx server (jail) is handling the certificates for all (sub)domains. So if i just can point from AdGuard Home to the location my Nginx server has put the files it would be great! vote +1 I too think that an option to use certificate file path would be simple enough for all DoH users (Let's Encrypt or otherwise). If 'home' users are smart enough to copy-paste contents of those files, they sure can enter a path to those files instead.  When setting the Upstream DNS servers from the default TLS to Cloudflare's DoH (https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query), rebooting the Pi causes AdGuard Home to behave unexpectedly once booted.\r\n\r\nNo clients can use DNS, the DNS requests all timeout. Trying to visit the admin page causes the settings page to freeze and not load for a very long time, with errors about timeouts for version checks to github. If I can get it to eventually load, I need to clear the DoH entry so it reverts back to the default TLS entries.\r\n\r\nOnce it uses TLS again, all clients can use DNS fine and the AdGuard Home admin interface works normally again.\r\n\r\nSo DNS-over-HTTPS does not work for me once I restart the Pi. Oops, you are right. I do have 1.1.1.1 as the bootstrap DNS server, does this mean the bootstrap must be different to the Upstream DNS server, or can I use IP addresses instead of the domain name, since the default TLS works at the moment?\r\n\r\neg. instead of `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`, I set\r\n`https://1.1.1.1/dns-query` and\r\n `https://1.0.0.1/dns-query` > Could you please export logs just in case? We want to make a DOH upstream default so it might be important.\r\n\r\nI've done it with verbose, but there is quite a bit of metadata. Could I email it to you so it's not public on here?\r\n\r\nFrom what I see, if you set the DoH without rebooting, it can work fine:\r\n`2019/03/12 09:51:22 [42] proxy.exchangeWithUpstream(): upstream https://cloudflare-dns.com:443/dns-query successfully finished exchange of ;adguardteam.github.io`\r\n\r\nBut once rebooted you get this instead:\r\n`2019/03/12 09:54:18 [40] proxy.exchangeWithUpstream(): upstream https://cloudflare-dns.com:443/dns-query failed to exchange ;sb.adtidy.org.`\r\n\r\nAnd since the admin interface relies on external connections, it also suffers. Thank you, sent it now. > Is this how it behaves every time or is it just after rebooting the pi?\r\n\r\nOnce I save the settings for the DoH server to overwrite the existing TLS defaults, it can still function (as you saw in the logs). But, once I either restart the service or restart the Pi, all DNS stops working no matter what I do. Once I set it back to TLS defaults and restart the service or Pi, all is working again. I tried to use Quad9's DoH and the same issue occurred. Unfortunately I also managed to completely break the entire AdGuard Home service as the default Cloudflare TLS also stopped working and rebooting the Pi wasn't doing anything either. Deleting the .yaml file and setting it up again still didn't work. Reinstalling the service didn't work either.\r\n\r\nI reinstalled Pi-hole and the DNS started to work again without a reboot.\r\n\r\nI think I need to try using AdGuard Home with a fresh install of Raspbian and not from a previous Pi-hole installation, and revisit this another time. It might be how much Pi-hole modifies or configs the Pi, but I won't know until I fresh install... does any over at AdGuard have a Raspberry Pi that could replicate installing Pi-hole, uninstalling it and then trying to run AdGuard Home for this? > Btw, have you been using the built-in DHCP in pi-hole and AGH?\r\n\r\nFor Pi-hole I was using the built-in DHCP as it works really good, for this instance I used my TP-Link to manage DHCP for using AdGuard Home as there are still some bugs to iron out, and no ability for static leases from memory.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing I can think of is that I was able to use '[cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared)' alongside Pi-hole so I could use DNS-over-HTTPS for 1.1.1.1, with this guide: https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns-over-https/\r\n\r\nIt was working really well.\r\n\r\nI did uninstall the service and remove all cloudflared files before trying AdGuard Home, but the fact that cloudflared can work for DoH and not AdGuard Home is confusing. It was the DHCP Domain name, yeah. Okay, I've played around with it some more after uninstalling Pi-hole again.\r\n\r\nI found the root issue, and it's that when I reboot the Pi, AdGuard Home is unable to use the DNS port for about 5 minutes (I timed it with a stopwatch).\r\n\r\nOnce 5 minutes passes, all DNS traffic works and the version checks in the Admin page pass, and I can also change to use and test upstream for any DNS, so both `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query` and `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query` works. I used v0.92-hotfix1 so I can see the banner appear for the new version. I can stop and restart AdGuard Home afterwards and it works straight away.\r\n\r\nIt's not related to the install or uninstall of the service, as running directly via `sudo ./AdGuardHome --host 192.168.0.2` produces the same results (and was useful for testing).\r\n\r\nThis is why setting the DoH was working before rebooting when I opened this issue. Something on this Pi isn't letting AdGuard Home work for 5 minutes after booting up, yet Pi-hole is able to load instantly.\r\n\r\n> 3\\. Also, I'd like to see what you have in `/etc/resolv.conf`\r\n\r\nPi-hole forces this to be 127.0.0.1 and leaves the static config on the Pi, but removing the static entry afterwards defaults resolv.conf to the IP of the Pi, in my case 192.168.0.2. Changing it to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 doesn't help during these 5 minutes regardless. It got to the point where nothing was working, including regular upstreams or changing the bootstrap. After 5 minutes, all DNS types can work.\r\n\r\nPi-hole was still using the TP-Link DHCP device, I simply ran the install command and once finished, dns started to work. Rebooting the Pi also works seconds after finishing boot.\r\n\r\nAnother thought I had is that I had a few \u2018apt-get\u2019 updates on the Pi, perhaps one of them has changed the behaviour of Raspbian in the last few weeks since I last used AdGuard Home. > Do they both (AGH and Pi-Hole) work under the same user?\r\n> Is it root?\r\n\r\nAdGuard Home doesn't require any user setup does it, it just uses the person's regular user account (eg. default 'pi')?\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see and from looking at their [install script](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh), I believe Pi-hole uses their own user (cloudflared does too).\r\n\r\n[Line 1708](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/ba1e94d3d9cf1894e0b5adca3e92738d21897568/automated%20install/basic-install.sh#L1708) in that script adds a user 'pihole'.\r\n\r\nAlso looking at this issue over at Pi-hole (https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues/1547), they mention that they use setcaps for binding ports, which I personally do not understand but might shed some light in how they operate it. They also seem to use root for some actions.\r\n\r\n> FTLDNS now runs as non-root but with setcap's for binding to lower ports and that's a big exposure reduced. I think this is a wider non-AGH related issue, as I have had the same issue with cloudflared. Others are experiencing the same issue as me, so I suspect something Pi related and not an issue with AdGuard Home.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/23 This is a greater issue, as it is Raspbian related.\r\n\r\nI fresh installed Raspbian from NOOBS, seemed to be a package from Nov 2018.\r\nAdGuard Home working perfect, cloudflared working perfect.\r\n\r\nNow I updated my Pi to the latest, and the same issue has occurred right away with AdGuard Home.\r\n\r\nI took note of what was updated for reference:\r\n\r\n``\r\napt apt-transport-https apt-utils base-files bluez-firmware curl gnupg gnupg-agent gpgv libapt-inst2.0 libapt-pkg5.0\r\n  libc-bin libc-dev-bin libc-l10n libc6 libc6-dbg libc6-dev libcurl3 libcurl3-gnutls libpam-systemd libperl5.24\r\n  libpolkit-agent-1-0 libpolkit-backend-1-0 libpolkit-gobject-1-0 libraspberrypi-bin libraspberrypi-dev\r\n  libraspberrypi-doc libraspberrypi0 libssl1.0.2 libssl1.1 libsystemd0 libudev1 libwbclient0 libxapian30 locales\r\n  multiarch-support openssh-client openssh-server openssh-sftp-server openssl perl perl-base perl-modules-5.24\r\n  policykit-1 python-rpi.gpio python3-six raspberrypi-bootloader raspberrypi-kernel raspberrypi-sys-mods raspi-config\r\n  raspi-copies-and-fills samba-common ssh systemd systemd-sysv tzdata udev wireless-regdb wpasupplicant\r\n``\r\n\r\n@ameshkov, so it seems like it could be easily replicated now, just update Raspbian to the latest versions via `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`, then `sudo reboot` and watch AdGuard Home not work for 5 minutes. \ud83d\ude22  Also need to figure out why services like _AGH_ and _cloudflared_ experience this issue, but _Pi-hole_ is able to avoid this 'bug' somehow in its functionality. Might help determine what exactly is the cause. I've seen the same issue since 0.92 too (the first version i tried) and while i had installed pi-hole first too I doubt that pi-hole could be the cause (can't imagine how?!). Regarding the user, i'm starting it with root, i guess they are using `cap_net_bind_service` to be able to open the privileged 53 port with another user.\r\n\r\n @szolin are you on an up to date Raspbian build and packages via apt-get? I can replicate the issue every time on fresh raspbian installs+ installing AGH + updating + rebooting, regardless of DHCP being enabled or not.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll need to check the log as soon as I can to see what there is regarding AGH. Same here, i've never enabled DHCP since i'm using the one on my router.\r\nI have configured the service like this:\r\n```\r\n[Unit]\r\nDescription=AdGuardHome DNS\r\nAfter=network.target

threads as shown in htop (vs the usual 8). And this is the log of the service after a reboot, but WITH verbose enabled: \r\n[adh3.log.txt.zip](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/3018487/adh3.log.txt.zip)\r\n\r\nNot much too see other than some requests failing after 200s. Still hundreds of threads in htop.\r\nBoth these tests are using only tls and parallel enabled.\r\n\r\nBut... i got it working right at boot with two DoH servers and no parallel, first time ever.\r\n\r\nEdit: Tried again after 2 minutes, it stopped working again. :( > Could you please check if it helps to ping 1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1?\r\n\r\nDoesn't work for me, the pings go through but adguard is still blocked(after 20 mins it still is) with the hundreds of threads.\r\n\r\n> It means that 1k requests are still pending (and their socket fd's are still opened) while they are waiting for network I/O.\r\n\r\nShould these be there in the first place? I mean, if we have another thread trying to make i/o to an unresponding address, should we open more? (also, shouldn't we have some limit?)\r\nBut ok, i don't even know what creates those threads and why so... nevermind.\r\n\r\n> I recommend using a network traffic sniffer like tcpdump or wireshark to ensure that those connection attempts are really delivered to the network interface.\r\n\r\nAs last resort yes.  Quickly adding that it is possible to ping 1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1 during this time, but it doesn\u2019t affect AGH regardless until 5 minutes after boot.\r\n\r\nIt was the same behaviour with cloudflared, I couldn\u2019t do anything to fix it until 5 minutes as well for cloudflared to start working. > There are two different issues:\r\n\r\n100% agree.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to send you the dump only when I'll be able to isolate the router and the pi0 in a somewhat proper testbed. Need some time to be able to set it up. Haven't had the chance to test it yet, but Raspbian had a [new update released on April 8](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/release_notes.txt), I would like to see if that has made any changes regarding this issue.\r\n\r\nForgot to mention, I'm running Raspbian Lite instead of the desktop version. Tried with cloudflared, still experiencing the same issue even with the recent updates for Raspbian and cloudflared. Going to assume that AdGuard Home would still experience the same issue then. Mentioned it at https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/91. @planet0 Does the issue still persist?  If yes, how about that tcpdump data for DNS requests?  You can use tcpdump's filters (IPs, ports) and give us only related information. @szolin I haven't forgotten about this! I've found some time to work on this now - <s>would you be able to help me figure out how to get the required tcpdump data from a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Lite?</s>\r\n\r\nEdit: Oops, I forgot about the instructions that @ameshkov provided above. Will get onto this, still sending to `devteam[at]adguard.com`? Some good news @szolin @ameshkov, it seems that with Raspbian Buster, I no longer need to wait 5 minutes on boot - network connections are going through just fine.  \ud83c\udf89  Can confirm this too!  If I edit the port for the admin interface in the .yaml file to 80, AdGuard Home cannot run. Trying to run `AdGuardHome -s start` causes the admin interface to not work. Running `AdGuardHome -s status` causes this output: `failed to get service status: the service is not installed`.\r\n\r\nIf I edit the .yaml file back to the original port set during install/wizard and start the service, everything runs normally again. ```\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 AdGuard Home, version v0.93\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.run(): Current working directory is /home/pi/AdGuardHome\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 AdGuard Home is running as a service\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.upgradeConfig(): got schema version 2\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 Reading config file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): Loading filter 1 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): File /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt, id 1, length 519780\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): Loading filter 1552200124 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): File /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1552200124.txt, id 1552200124, le$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): Loading filter 1552200125 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): File /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1552200125.txt, id 1552200125, le$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): Loading filter 1552200126 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*filter).load(): File /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1552200126.txt, id 1552200126, le$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] main.(*configuration).write(): Writing YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] dnsforward.(*Server).initDNSFilter(): Creating dnsfilter\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] dnsforward.(*Server).startInternal(): Loading stats from querylog\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 file \"/home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/querylog.json\": read 10489 entries in 1.276985771s, 121.745\u00b5s/entry$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Start DNS server periodic jobs\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Starting the DNS proxy server\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Ratelimit is enabled and set to 20 rps\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 The server is configured to refuse ANY requests\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 DNS cache is enabled\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Creating the UDP server socket\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Listening to udp://192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Creating the TCP server socket\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Listening to tcp://192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Entering the tcp listener loop on 192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Entering the UDP listener loop on 192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:12 [6] dnsforward.(*Server).startInternal(): Loading stats from querylog\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 file \"/home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/querylog.json\": read 10489 entries in 1.276985771s, 121.745\u00b5s/entry$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Start DNS server periodic jobs\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Starting the DNS proxy server\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Ratelimit is enabled and set to 20 rps\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 The server is configured to refuse ANY requests\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 DNS cache is enabled\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Creating the UDP server socket\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Listening to udp://192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Creating the TCP server socket\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Listening to tcp://192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Entering the tcp listener loop on 192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Entering the UDP listener loop on 192.168.0.2:53\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 Go to http://192.168.0.2:80\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 [13] main.(*filter).update(): Downloading update for filter 1 from https://adguardteam.github.io/Ad$\r\n2019/03/11 06:42:13 listen tcp 192.168.0.2:80: bind: address already in use\r\n```\r\nAnd then it stops there. Okay, I figured it out, uninstalling Pi-hole does not completely remove itself, and it leaves `lighttpd` installed and active, hence why port 80 was still used.\r\n\r\nTo figure this out I ran `sudo netstat -tulpn` which listed all open ports on the Pi, and port 80 was linked to lighttpd. Once I ran `sudo apt-get remove lighttpd`, port 80 was available again and AdGuard can use it.\r\n\r\nTechnically not an issue with AdGuard Home, but could there be a way for AdGuard Home to automatically know if port 80 is already used and to offer overwriting or display what is currently using this port, like what netstat seems to do? I just predict a lot of Pi-hole users will be eventually trying AdGuard Home out and this will currently be an issue. > Well, that's what we do during the initial configuration wizard -- AGH checks for port availability.\r\n\r\nYou are right, I was thinking afterwards when you edit the .yaml file and you run `sudo ./AdGuardHome -s start`, you're never going to know the error unless you enable logging. That is normal behaviour though, so nevermind. This issue will be good reference though if anyone else tried to use port 80 after the wizard.  Following the Wiki steps for Raspberry Pi, there is a missing step:\r\n\r\nBefore you can run `sudo ./AdGuardHome -s install`, you need to run `cd AdGuardHome` into the AdGuardHome folder that was unpacked, otherwise you will get a `sudo: ./AdGuardHome: command not found` error without doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, after running the installation script, it would be nice if it had a little more detail on what it did, eg. \"AdGuard Home is now creating a service...\", \"AdGuard Home installation was successful. AdGuard Home is now running and will automatically run on startup.\". Then following it up by telling the user to visit the IP 192.X.X.X:3000 via a web browser to continue setup for the wizard.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, during the web browser setup wizard, it ran into its own error if port 80 is already is use. Since we are visiting the setup via port 3000 already, when clicking next and it can't bind port 80 (Pi-hole leaves this occupied after uninstalling), it tries to use port 3000 instead, and you get a 'port already in use' error. You cannot continue setup unless you change it to a different port, so this should either be that the Wizard uses a different port for setup and allows port 3000 for the Web Interface, or vice versa.  This feature allows everything in the blocklist (to be NXDOMAIN) redirected to a page that contains a notification that \"this site\" is blocked  This feature allows administrators to change port 80 (used by administration pages) to other ports (like 8080, etc) > \r\n> \r\n> You can change it in `AdGuardHome.yaml` already.\r\n> \r\n> So do you mean that you'd like us to let you change these settings in the UI?\r\n\r\nYes, a GUI version like we add filter, disable filter, and turn on the filter, for easy way.  1. Add GUI feature on dashboard can change port for administrator dashboard from port 80 to another port (like 8080)\r\n2. Make 2 level administration (login button), if not login, non login user can look \"Dashboard\" & \"Query Log\" but cannot change any configuration\r\n3. If a domain blocked on filterlist, administrator can change the redirect to a blocked page (not show NXDOMAIN) > Could you please file two different feature requests?\r\n\r\non separate? you mean? > \r\n> \r\n> Yeah\r\n\r\nOkay.  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

Of course, this would also be a nice feature for privacy to give user opertunity to not log certain domain queries.\r\n\r\nReason being, I have a device from [Efergy](https://efergy.com/engage-online-monitoring/) that monitors my house's power consumption and sends the info to the cloud, but it seems to do a call every 15 to 20 seconds filling up the query log.  Unfortunately, I have no control of the device as it is a block box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I think this \"do not log\" is just like a filter in Fiddler.\r\nI've mention about 1 week ago. Maybe you can take a look.\r\nThe author says this feature will be implement in next version...\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/594 Indeed!\r\n\r\nI suppose the decision is either to log all DNS queries and then hide what you do not want to see, or mark DNS queries as \"private\" meaning they never get logged in the first place.  The latter might be a good option for privacy seeing that Adgaurd is basically about privacy, while the first is enhanced filter capabilities of the query log.\r\n\r\nGuess we have to wait for @ameshkov weigh in :)  Add the device hostname that is doing the DNS query to the query log.  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

The DNS query would be sent to the router who then would query it against the DNS address of 192.168.10.13 (AdGuard) as configured,  I then think AdGuard take the request, and would try query the DNS by pushing it back to 192.168.10.1 (router) as this is the DNS address in its DHCP.  Does this make sense?\r\n\r\nSince I made the change, no more funny logs are appearing.\r\n Unfortunately it came back, and it seems to be an issue with missing IPv6 records.\r\n\r\nAdguard is trying to check the filter lists, probably doing a periodic update check.  When hitting each filter's URL, if the DNS record for the filter does not have an AAAA (IPv6) entry, it seems to go into loop and retries once per minute for that filter.  Also, this only seems to occur when Adguard is using itself as the DNS server.\r\n\r\nInfo:\r\n- Raspberry Pi 3 where Adguard runs is 192.168.10.13\r\n- Router DHCP (reserved IP of 192.168.10.13) gives the Raspberry Pi DNS servers where 192.168.10.13 is first in list (as I want all devices connecting to router to use Adguard as DNS server).\r\n- Adguard is then using this DNS server (itself) to check the filter URLs updates (as it also has DHCP assigned address).\r\n- I can see the Raspberry Pi IP address doing the DNS query in Adguard Query Log which is correct.\r\n- If I give the Raspberry Pi static DNS servers (override the DNS servers assigned in DHCP and remove 192.168.10.13), Adgaurd then does the DNS query directly against the static DNS server bypassing itself.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced by alternating between the source and mirror of Malware Domain List if the Raspberry Pi (Adgaurd) is configured to use itself as the DNS server,\r\n\r\nhttps://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt (no AAAA record- frequent entries for this filter in query log)\r\n\r\nhttps://gitcdn.xyz/repo/NanoMeow/MDLMirror/master/hosts.txt (has AAAA record- single log for this filter in query log)\r\n I'll test over the next 24 hours and revert. @ameshkov \r\n\r\nIt is fixed, refreshes every 30 minutes like it should.\r\n\r\nI actually think it was similar to #644 where the filter update interval too frequent.  @ameshkov\r\nIt seems that once I saw a comment about the migration to Crowdin, my question when it will be?. I could also contribute with the Adguard Home translation and if I had more time I would help with the other AdGuard products. This request is because some translations are very literal and do not make sense.\r\n\r\nAnd if you agree me to as proofreader, it's up to you. @ameshkov\r\nYou could assign me as proofreader/moderator and thus approve the correct translations. I already translated and corrected several lines in the AdGuard Home project. @ameshkov\r\nI prefer not to give any details, for personal reasons. I only say that my translations are be reviewed and/or approved. Thanks. >By details I mean your username on oneskyapp so that she could grant you the proofreader/moderator role :) Her email is `aalpatkina at adguard.com`\r\n\r\nSo that this conversation does not get longer, my nickname in `oneskyapp` is the same that I use in GitHub, and about the email for personal reasons I will not provide it. My goal is not to collaborate to obtain rewards/licenses by `adguard.com`, it is only so that the people who speak my language understand it. I only say that my translations are be reviewed and/or approved. Thanks.\r\n\r\n`AdGuard Home` is a product that I use and that's why I want to help with its translation of it. @MS-PC now you have a moderator's access. You can check and approve/disapprove translations. \r\nPlease do not click on \"Finalize\" button after approval.\r\n\r\nFor further information, please contact me at aalpatkina@adguard.com\r\n @MS-PC that's weird. Is this your account shown on the screenshot?\r\n\r\n![up17k7eaj](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31620257/54980565-29c69380-4fb7-11e9-8f5f-52dc6986c531.png)\r\n\r\n @MS-PC please check the account you specified. I've just changed your status to \"moderator\" there.\r\nSo now you can delete your comment :)   This would be a good feature for users using two or more Upstream DNS servers.\r\n\r\n[Load Balancing Options](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Load-Balancing-Options)\r\n i think it's for some privacy reason \r\n\r\nsimilar thinking like i wrote on [https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/790](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/790)\r\n\r\nshare the request's over 2+n resolvers would be more privacy than over one single... so none of the servers got all your request   Please can you add an optional dark theme of some sort? There are plenty of examples online to take inspiration from like community-made Atom themes hosted on Github. I have a browser extension that allows me to turn any website \"dark\" but it basically just inverts CSS colours, so the colour-coded bits in AdGuard Home and the logo in the top-left don't really work. \r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n<!--- drag and drop, upload or paste your screenshot to this area-->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1901532/53680286-17677b80-3cd1-11e9-9b00-26f3d5bfcafd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| 0.93\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| Primary DNS for my Router\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| Raspberry Pi 3 Model B \r\n| Operating system and version:| latest Raspbian (I updated last night)\r\n\r\n\r\n### EDIT\r\n\r\nFor those interested I have published my latest dark theme CSS on userstyles.org for Stylus users: \r\n\r\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/177418/adguard-home-dark \r\n\r\nI recommend using the \"Customize Settings\" button to set the IP address or local domain of your AdGuard Home interface before installing the theme, so that it works straight away.

I'll review it there because it's certainly a lot easier when you see the context on the interface screenshots.\r\nI did read through https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-translations - indeed very useful cross-language advice a while ago.  I have translated it into Simplified Chinese(\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587)(zh-CN) yet.\r\nHope you will use my [translations.](http://adguard.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=153384)\r\n\r\nThanks. Your translations need to be approved by the moderator of Simplified Chinese or AG team.\r\n\r\nBut they maybe need to communicate with each other first if approving your translations or not.\r\n\r\nIn general, AG team won't approve translations since there is already a moderator for the language. In your translation of #48541893, there is a mistake.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/K0nDNAD.png)\r\n</details><br/>\r\n\r\nEnglish:\r\nIf you want to enable the built-in DHCP server, make sure that there is no other active DHCP server.

Thanks a lot! Hi, I am one of the current Simplified Chinese moderators, and had known you had finished the AdGuard Home translation, thanks for your work.\r\n\r\nIt may takes someday to check your translation and do some editing if needed. I will inform you and developers once the translation checking finished, and update them for the software.\r\n\r\nThanks for your understanding. @ameshkov \r\nSorry for late. The Simplified Chinese translation for AdGuard Home is ready to update into the program now.\r\nThanks @Zhijie327 's work.   1. Add a \"Reboot\" button on the home page\r\n2. Add a \"Clear Log\" button between \"Disable log\" and \"Download log file\" I think after the update process, a reboot can be better to apply its new feature. Or in another case, the problem of slow response due to the long running time may be solved by a reboot. Alright, I got it.  With Redirect to HTTPS set to enabled, I do not see the http link getting redirected to https instead it shows as cannot connect to server.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbind_host: 0.0.0.0\r\nbind_port: 3000\r\nauth_name: ########\r\nauth_pass: ########\r\nlanguage: \"\"\r\ndns:\r\n  bind_host: 0.0.0.0\r\n  port: 53\r\n  protection_enabled: true\r\n  filtering_enabled: true\r\n  blocked_response_ttl: 10\r\n  querylog_enabled: true\r\n  ratelimit: 20\r\n  ratelimit_whitelist: []\r\n  refuse_any: true\r\n  bootstrap_dns: 8.8.8.8:53\r\n  parental_sensitivity: 13\r\n  parental_enabled: true\r\n  safesearch_enabled: false\r\n  safebrowsing_enabled: true\r\n  upstream_dns:\r\n  - tls://1.1.1.1\r\n  - tls://1.0.0.1\r\ntls:\r\n  enabled: true\r\n  server_name: ########\r\n  force_https: true\r\n  port_https: 443\r\n  port_dns_over_tls: 853\r\n  certificate_chain: |-\r\n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\n    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\r\n  private_key: |-\r\n    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n    -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n``` That is correct. \r\n\r\nAtleast that is my understanding of the redirect feature. I use domain in the HTTP link.\r\n\r\nYes, port 80, 443 and 3000 are open and reachable and https link works. Yes, that is correct. I was playing around the WEB UI port setting, after changing the port from 3000 to 80 restarted adguard service, I could see the redirect to https working, after which I switched back the web UI port 3000, restarted adguard service and still the redirect to HTTPS worked.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould this be a one-off issue? I have not build a new ADG server from scratch again, it is only during the initial ADG setup I faced this issue. So far after the workaround (my last comment above), I have never faced this issue again once the server was up and running.  I am trying to config AGH to generate a local log file rather than log to Windows Event Log by populating the log_file settnig in the config file. I can't seem to get it to work and everything permutation I try results in the AGH service not starting and an error being logged:\r\n\r\n`yaml: line 70: found unknown escape character`\r\n\r\nNOTE: The documentation for this setting states:\r\n`log_file \u2014 Path to the log file. If empty, writes to stdout, if syslog -- system log (or eventlog on Windows).`\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Configuration\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1. Change log_file setting from \"\" to\r\n2. log_file: \"c:\\install\\AdGuardHome\"\r\n3. log_file: \"c:\\install\\AdGuardHome\\\"\r\n4. log_file: \"c:\\install\\AdGuardHome\\AGH.log\"\r\nnone of which worked and all generated the above error.\r\n\r\nWhat finally worked was \"log_file: AGH.log\"\r\n\r\nCould I suggest either:\r\n1. fixing the Wiki and remove the word 'path' and just say 'filename', OR\r\n2. Fix AGH so you can actually put a path in the setting.\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| v0.93\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| (System/Router/IoT)\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| (e.g. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)\r\n| Operating system and version:| Windows Server 2012 R2\r\n Sorry, forgot to mention that I'd tried `c:/install/AdGuardHome` (I'm used to working with UNIX ports to Windows forgetting to change forward-slashes to back-slashes :)\r\n\r\nBoth `c:/install/AdGuardHome` and `c:\\\\install\\\\AdGuardHome` failed with same error as original post.

Since I was restricted to 1Gb ram, my VM was starved of resources. \r\n\r\nI added a 4GB Swap which seems to resolve the issue with Adguard using upto 2GB of Swap on top of 1GB RAM with all filters  activated in below config.\r\n\r\nMost of the Memory was used by two of the fiters, upon disabling them I saw memory usage return to within 1GB.\r\n\r\nfree -m\r\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\r\nMem:            990         892          72           0          25           8\r\nSwap:          4095         120        3975\r\n\r\nps aux --sort -rss\r\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\r\nroot      1669  1.9 87.3 1146224 885660 ?

I was just missing the bootstrap -.-  Just came here to report this exact issue :)\r\n\r\nIssue I hit is that \"NETWORK SERVICE\" doesn't have permissions on file system anywhere so after initial install, on first attempt to start service it fails because it cannot write the update config file.\r\n\r\nThe exact Windows error log was:\r\n`Couldn't save YAML config: rename C:\\install\\AdGuardHome\\AdGuardHome.yaml.tmp C:\\install\\AdGuardHome\\AdGuardHome.yaml: Access is denied.`\r\n\r\nAfter giving the \"NETWORK SERVICE\" account Modify permission to the folder the service now starts fine.\r\n\r\nI've then noticed that it wouldn't ingest previous logs and so all statistics have reset.

Thanks for the great work you did with AdGuard Home, you could provide the binaries for Windows x86 - 32-bit, since for almost all systems its x86 version is provided, and it would be very helpful for some people who want to implement it in a Windows x86.\r\n\r\nIt's just a suggestion/request, it's up to you. @ameshkov\r\nIf I have a small Notebook/Laptop to do the test, but the test would do it on Thursday or Friday due to time issues.\r\nIt would be great if you would give me the build for Windows x86 :+1:. @ameshkov \r\nIt works fine! :+1:. @ameshkov\r\nI do not know if I consider them issues, in case it is helpful I will describe them:\r\n\r\n1.

It works. Thanks! 2 features request(optional):\r\n 1. add `--pidfile` argument(save self pid to file)\r\n 2. add symbol link config support(if changed any settings on web, adguard will overwrite symbol link file)  I have set up the AdGuard Home in my vps server, and it worked fine for several minutes. After a while, something happened and the DNS cannot be used. The reason for it is that the vps provider \"has detected an insecure recursive DNS resolver on IP ***(my vps ip), which may result in your server getting involved in DNS Amplification DoS attacks.\" and blocked the 53 port.\r\n\r\nThen I removed the block rule and reopen the AdGuard Home, it worked fine again. But after a while, the same thing happened again.\r\n\r\nIn the client area, I can see some normal client ip as well as 127.0.0.1 and 2a06:e881:5100::1, I don't know if it matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| v0.92-hotfix2\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| System\r\n| Operating system and version:| Centos 6 x86_64 minimal \r\n @ghoshorn \r\nYou have to make sure you do not listen and respond to your public IP & IPv6 on 53 from AGH! \r\nAnd you do only listen and do resolving for your private subnets that you hand out to VPN client.

But the same problem happened again after a while. So maybe there are some other configs I didn't set right?  @mveplus  > I guess your VPS provider is hetzner as I recognize this type of notifications. They simply do not allow public DNS resolvers so the only viable solution would be to use another VPS provider (or maybe restrict the IP addresses you allow as @mveplus has suggested).\r\n> \r\n> AdGuard Home by default takes some anti-DNS-amplification measures:\r\n> \r\n> * Rate-limiter is set to 20 rps\r\n> * ANY requests are disabled\r\n\r\n@ameshkov \r\nThe provider is bandwagon.\r\nDeploying on a vps can make it faster and more convenient than on my mac, so maybe I'll have some other tries to avoid this problem. @ameshkov Thank you for your extra test on your vps, and sad to hear my vps does not support it. Maybe I should try to find another way to make it work, thanks. @ghoshorn  do you use standard DNS as upstream resolvers? You can try to use TLS:// instead classic DNS and see if it makes any difference?  I hear you that you listen only on IPV4 - 127.0.0.1 but what about IPv6? Make sure you have firewall rules disabling queries on UDP/TCP 53 on both IP4 and IPV6 public interfaces check with nmap without VPN from outside and do change upstream to DoH or DoT may help mitigate the issue. \r\nIf after that still does not work as per @ameshkov hint you could migrate to another VPS, I do use Linode, DigitalOcean and VPS.net never heard about bandwagon until now. \r\nCheers, @mveplus No IPv6 traffic during my test, seen from the query logs. And upstream_dns set as: \r\n  upstream_dns:\r\n  - tls://1.1.1.1\r\n  - tls://1.0.0.1\r\nSo maybe I need to migrate to another VPS. Thank you a lot!\r\n\r\nP.S.  bandwagon --> https://bandwagonhost.com/index.php Related to this, hetzner relayed an email to me today send by the bsi.bund.de (translates to something like Federal Office for Security in Information Technology) which is a government branch. I've had setup a small test instance on a docker machine of mine. Following this lead I did a small check on the official adguard home dns servers and they also seem to be not secured against reflection attacks, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://openresolver.com/?ip=176.103.130.130\r\nhttp://openresolver.com/?ip=176.103.130.132\r\n\r\nSo basically the official setup could be abused right now?\r\n  Currently AdGuardHome.yaml appears to be stored in `/` instead of `/opt/adguardhome/conf` when running the docker. The current instructions in the readme claim the configuration files should be mapped to here, however this do not create any persistence. \r\n\r\n```\r\nConfiguration - /opt/adguardhome/conf\r\nFilters and data - /opt/adguardhome/work\r\n```\r\n\r\n @hexeth to have persistent configuration and data you can use `adguard/adguardhome:edge` version of the image for now.  If I write in Terminal    sudo: ./AdGuardHome\r\n\r\nI got this error message    : command not found\r\n\r\nWhat might be wrong?

The public rootCA certificate imported into the browser and the private key used to sign blocked pages certificate, this will eliminate browser warnings, and also additional user interactions.

Steps to reproduce:\r\n- Have a google wifi system\r\n- have an adguard home instance on GCP\r\n- disable all dns filtering on AdBlockHome\r\n- point your google wifi DNS at the GCP instance with adguard home\r\n- netflix.com and youtube.com along with various other domains stop resolving by timeout, but various websites like ebay.com and others work fine\r\n- `nslookup` and `host` seem to resolve all DNS properly at all times\r\n\r\nThis is repeatable on every device in the house, including phones and playstation\r\n\r\nI have poked this from several angles and here is a summary:\r\n\r\n*Broken:*\r\n- chrome dns client -> google wifi dns server as served by DHCP -> AdGuardHome (as custom dns in google wifi). \r\nNote: The query is shown in AdGuardHome's log as NOT filtered\r\n\r\n*Works:*\r\n- chrome dns client  -> google wifi dns server as served by DHCP -> Google DNS\r\n- chrome dns client  -> google wifi dns server as served by DHCP -> opendns public server\r\n- `nslookup`/`host` -> google wifi dns server as served by DHCP -> AdGuardHome\r\n- any device/client -> directly AdGuardHome IP\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIt appears that when all of the conditions below are true, DNS times out:\r\n- when a client that isn't a cli-tool is used\r\n- when accessing netflix.com or youtube.com\r\n- Google wifi is used\r\n- Google wifi is configured to use AdGuard DNS as a custom DNS server\r\n\r\nAdGuardHome always appears to log and return all queries properly, but the response never makes it back to the client.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is an issue with Google Wifi when used with AdGuardHome.  Specifically it looks like Google home is blocking or dropping specific domain responses from AdGuardHome.  Strangely though, this never fails when using CLI tools.\r\n\r\nAny ideas from anyone?\r\n Hey @ameshkov - sorry I never got back to you or relied here.  This is fixed in the newest docker image of AdGuardHome today!  I just turned it on again 48 hours ago and things are working great. This problem mysteriously returned, but I found a fix.  Maybe you can tell me what is going on.\r\n\r\nWhen netflix.com or youtube.com were queried from chrome, nothing worked.  This does not occur on android or iphone devices, my playstation, xbox, or even from command line.\r\n\r\nI simply went to AdGuard Home and clicked 'Disable Protection' on the main page.  I already had all filtering off, but apparently this button disables something even more.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98695/59008179-7102a900-87de-11e9-992a-cbe50fee0ba8.png)\r\n\r\nUpstream, I am using Cloudflare's DNS over HTTPs endpoint, FYI.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I Enable Protection (whatever its doing) the problem returns.  Seems to be a bug?  Very strange that it only effects chrome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1. eero set to not use ipv6 (otherwise, bypasses adguard when necessary and uses Google DNS)\r\n2. eero DNS caching off\r\n3.

AdGuardHome...... the reason why we are here...  I was wondering if you could give me a little info on how Adguard home works with ipv6. I have ipv6 disabled as I'm not sure how to set it up with adguard home. \r\n\r\nWhen using DNS over TLS or DNScrypt you use 127.0.0.1 and the local address like 192.168.0.10 for other devices. I know about ::1 for the device that is running Adguard but what about other devices and do I use say cloudflare DNScrypt stamp for ipv6?.\r\n I don't really understand how ipv6 queries is getting forward to Adguard Home. \r\nI'm using DNScrypt as a example for forwarding with 127.0.0.1 and ::1. I just want to make sure that all DNS queries are using DNScrypt or DNS over TLS for upstream.  \r\n\r\nexample: Adguard Home is on local ip 192.168.0.100 i change my laptop DNS to local ip 192.168.0.100 to forward queries to Adguard Home. How are ipv6 queries getting from the laptop to Adguard Home with out a local ipv6. Ok thanks for the info. Just one more question i'm assuming i would use a ipv6 upstream with adguard home for the IPv6 enabled devices.  After using AdGuard Home instead of Pi-hole, I was wondering if there is a cache implementation like Pi-hole has, in order to reduce loading times? Would there be any way to have this indicated in the UI? Like how many are currently cached (and the limit AdGuard will keep), and also display in the log which queries were cached? Would there be any way to have this indicated in the UI? Like how many are currently cached (and the limit AdGuard will keep), and also display in the log which queries were cached? vote +1  Here's a couple of changes that implement enhancement #550 Oops sorry, managed muck that up. I'll try again later  Allowing the DNS server to bind to a configurable address would allow addresses other than 0.0.0.0 to be used, this would allow AdGuardHome to be used in docker containers where the host already binds to address 0.0.0.0 typically because it is running a dns server for its containers.\r\n\r\nMy usecase is running in a Balena.io IOT container, which already has address 0.0.0.0 bound, so I would bind to the docker hosts external IP Address [https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/runtime/#using-dns-resolvers-in-your-container]\r\n\r\nIt looks like the DNSProxy library used already supports configuring the address, just can't see a way to set it via AdGuardHome config files. No worries, I think I have a solution for this I've submitted a pull request #551  Hello I\u2019m a Asus Tinker Board S user I\u2019m wondering if your server program can be run on a Asus Tinker Board S?

Ah, OK.\r\n\r\nI am going this route because originally I had trouble getting my router to _keep_ the DNS addresses. So, I thought I'd put my old Mac Mini to use but only got so far! Finally, I was able to add AdGuard on my router but I *still* see ads all over the place. I am not sure what else I could do? I also tried changing DNS on my Mac Network settings but that didn't seem to do anything either.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to use the browser extension... What am I navigating to exactly on the Mac Mini to get the admin panel? The IP address is 192.168.0.37 and the install is at /Users/newuser/AdGuardian\r\n\r\nI was able to connect to doubleclick still. Setting the DNS addresses on my router did nothing.  > Tbh, I think our web interface simply does not work with the browsers so old.\r\n> \r\n> @IldarKamalov can enlighten us on what are the minimum browser versions it supports.\r\n\r\nCurrent browsers support \u2013 Chrome > 49, Firefox > 45, Safari > 9, Opera > 36 UPDATE: I had to restart the DNS server again and I can see the Dashboard in Chrome!\r\nnslookup ad.doubleclick.com is now showing it's blocked! Hooray!!\r\n\r\nI also was able to get my main gateway to hold the AdGuard DNS addresses whereas it wasn't before and was just reseting back to Comcast DNS settings. However, even though my devices on the network reflect the AdGuard DNS entries, I still get ads like there's no protection. Any idea why this would not work?\r\n\r\nBut, when I set my other Mac DNS to the AdGuard Home server it blocks ads! YAAY!  Just my curiosity. I took inspiration from your code to build a simple dns server for my own needs and today I noticed that CoreDns was dropped. Can you share with us why? Exactly the feeling I had when they said CoreDns cannot be used as a library. Thanks for the clarification.  Hello, i created a custom Filter (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Bluscream/abb44b800220f4a90406505f6bdb86d0/raw/redirect.txt) to redirect some domains in my local network to specific IPs. But they almost never get resolved successfully:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3318223/51095582-1c6e7b00-17b6-11e9-9739-bad831e95101.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy question is: Can i make these redirects work for all devices using AGHome? Why is that? According to all sites it is okay to have multiple domains per line (Example: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file))\r\n\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1  localhost loopback\r\n::1        localhost\r\n```\r\n```\r\n...

Therefore, the AGH blocks domains not intended by the user. This is inconvenient because many filters that are published can not be used. I think that my idea is simple, but I respect your policy. And how about adding a function to exclude this filter in order to know that user can not use the domain only filter ? ```il.com``` = ```||il.com```\r\n\r\nDo not you assume that \"il.com\" and \"|| il.com\" are the same ?

Just wondering if those special characters would conflict your syntax rules in the future (I'm not familiar with adguard syntax/adblock rules).   For some reason, trying to use Netflix on a Telstra TV device (powered by Roku) refuses to work with AdGuard Home... but it works fine with Pi-hole.\r\n\r\nWhen I select 'Check your network', Netflix server 3 always results in a **nw-3-6** error which [according to Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/12977) is an issue connecting to Netflix. It also states my Connection speed is `0 Mbps` and that \"Your device may not be connected to the internet.

Linux AMD64 image (v0.9->v0.92) under Ubuntu 16.04.1 WSL on Windows 10 on a Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM PC.\r\n2. Windows image (v0.92->v0.92 hotfix 1) under Windows Server 2012 R2 on HP Proliant MicroServer gen8 (Pentium G2020T CPU, 16GB RAM).\r\n\r\nMassive amounts of headroom in both CPU and RAM on both devices.\r\nI have about 50 devices on my home network.\r\n\r\nIn general operation, I've never seen the General Processing time get under 100ms, and it is usually around 130ms.\r\n\r\nThe ONLY time I saw it lower was when I was migrating from environment 1 (Linux image on Win10) to environment 2 (Windows image on Win Server 2012) and had both of them running concurrently and let devices migrate to the new one as they renewed the DHCP IP info to pick up the new DNS server.\r\n\r\nIn the first 24 horus where the new environment only had a handful of devices using it, the general processing time was in the 20-40ms range. Within a couple of days when all of my devices had migrated over, it was back up to the 100+ms average.\r\n\r\nI've just upgraded from v0.92 to v0.92-hotfix1 in the last hour so I'll give that 24 hours to get current stats given v0.92 had a couple of DNS bugs that might cause bad results.\r\n\r\nMy config, for reference:\r\n\r\nbind_host: 0.0.0.0\r\nbind_port: 3000\r\nauth_name: ####\r\nauth_pass: ####\r\nlanguage: \"\"\r\ndns:\r\n  port: 53\r\n  protection_enabled: true\r\n  filtering_enabled: true\r\n  blocked_response_ttl: 10\r\n  querylog_enabled: true\r\n  ratelimit: 20\r\n  ratelimit_whitelist: []\r\n  refuse_any: true\r\n  bootstrap_dns: 8.8.8.8:53\r\n  parental_sensitivity: 0\r\n  parental_enabled: false\r\n  safesearch_enabled: false\r\n  safebrowsing_enabled: true\r\n  upstream_dns:\r\n  - tls://1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com\r\n  - tls://one.one.one.one\r\n  - tls://dns.adguard.com\r\nfilters:\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt\r\n  name: AdGuard Simplified Domain Names filter\r\n  last_updated: 2019-01-05T13:11:55.9815204+11:00\r\n  id: 1\r\n- enabled: false\r\n  url: https://adaway.org/hosts.txt\r\n  name: AdAway\r\n  id: 2\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: https://hosts-file.net/ad_servers.txt\r\n  name: hpHosts - Ad and Tracking servers only\r\n  last_updated: 2019-01-05T13:11:56.2391441+11:00\r\n  id: 3\r\n- enabled: true\r\n  url: http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt\r\n  name: MalwareDomainList.com Hosts List\r\n  last_updated: 2019-01-05T13:11:58.7861454+11:00\r\n  id: 4\r\nuser_rules:\r\n- \"\"\r\ndhcp:\r\n  enabled: false\r\n  interface_name: \"\"\r\n  gateway_ip: \"\"\r\n  subnet_mask: \"\"\r\n  range_start: \"\"\r\n  range_end: \"\"\r\n  lease_duration: 0\r\nschema_version: 2\r\n I upgraded to v0.92-hotfix1 and for last 10 hours, the response time as reported on web gui went up to 70ms.

All too technical for me ;( - however, after lettingAdGuard run for a few days my Average Processing Time is at 400! It starts out at 3 and keeps rising. I would say benchmark can be misleading too, because you run that benchmark on some specific domain for short period.\r\nBut your AdGaurd Home is running for 24 hours and that's the time you can see there.\r\n\r\nI would say it should be an option in the Query to see what is the query that is taking long time to run and provide the result in the query log, so we can see what's running slowly. @hmage but we don't have that in the query log view (in dashboard) and that's what I meant.\r\n  I've been running v0.93 for about 12 hours now and my average processing time is 403.11ms\r\n17,658 DNS Queries\r\n1,277 blocked.\r\n\r\nI'll turn on verbose logging to capture some data. About 24 hours on and average processing time is **414.92ms**\r\n31,208 DNS Queries\r\n2,424 blocked (7.77%)\r\n\r\nRan verbose logging for about 45 mins. Zipped log attached\r\n\r\n[AGH - Copy.zip](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/2914719/AGH.-.Copy.zip)\r\n I do have \"Use AdGuard browsing security web service\" enabled\r\nI do not have \"Use AdGuard parental control web service\" enabled\r\n\r\nI had wondered if maybe a couple of really slow queries were skewing the average processing time. When I first started v0.93 for the first hour the average processing time was around 50ms. It just seems that in that sustained 24 hour period there are enough slow responses to really skew the averages.\r\n\r\nIf I check my AGH now, the average processing time is 278.74ms\r\n28,447 DNS queries\r\n2,210 blocked by filters (7.77%) Thanks! Logs definitely show a clearer picture now.\r\n[AGH - Copy.zip](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/files/2998967/AGH.-.Copy.zip)\r\n\r\n\"SafeBrowsing HTTP\" is adding a minimum of 300ms to each DNS lookup based on my logs.\r\nThere are a handful of 0ms entries which must be invalid. After that they are constantly 329ms, 343ms, 372ms, etc. I'm guessing then that entries that show 0ms are cached responses? So I turned off 'browsing security' yesterday and now my Average Processing time is 47ms\r\n\r\nThat is a pretty significant impact!  Seeing odd behaviour when using a DNScrypt Stamp. Youtube will not load and Tidal music will not play any music (with in the app). When using Cloudflare DoH or DoT it will when Cloudflare works.\r\n\r\nHalf the time Cloudflare will not work at all.\r\n\r\nUsing Adguard Home Windows 10. This issue was not fixed with the v0.92-hotfix1. Cloudflare will not work at all most the time and when using a DNScrypt Stamp somethings will not open/load.  The only way I can get cloudflare to work is tls://1.1.1.1 or just 1.1.1.1 it seems all other ways will not work. My goal is to use my DNScrypt servers for upstream but when using them as I said before some things will not open/load. When I get some free time i'll look more into it for you. ~~Seems to be working now. It's still not working~~ Maybe it is working now the issue seem to be when using my own dnscrypt servers when I used let's say opendns dnscrypt server everything would work right.\r\n\r\nMy two servers are:\r\nsdns://AQcAAAAAAAAADjE0OS4yNDguNTEuMjEyIJqd7T8sjWmQU5pdBaP5FF2vX0xrz561gdeGrur3jCHfHTIuZG5zY3J5cHQtY2VydC5ldmlsdmliZXMuY29t\r\n\r\nsdns://AQcAAAAAAAAADjEwNC4xNTYuMjUyLjE4ILNYRzmUAe4JezM_eiaokRdEOF7hA_jTl65AAyNMlNYQHTIuZG5zY3J5cHQtY2VydC5ldmlsdmliZXMuY29t\r\n\r\nTry testing them from your end see if youtube will open.\r\n\r\nSorry for all the edits!\r\n  Just wondering what the planned future feature set is for the AGH DHCP server?\r\n\r\nFeatures I'm hoping to see added include:\r\n\r\n1.

Support for multiple IP ranges/multiple scopes (i.e. support non-contiguous IP blocks in the same subnet but also support multiple IP ranges that may have a different subnet mask and possibly different gateway/DNS/etc.)\r\n4. Collision detection (if not already capable), i.e. detect if allocated IP already exists on the network.\r\n5.

I came here to request this, but it turns out it already is.  Running AdGuard Home v0.92 on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.\r\nCloudflare DNS servers are configured as Upstream DNS servers (regular DNS over UDP, since DoT currently causes issues with AdGuard Home).\r\n\r\nThe problems is that on my Sony Bravia Android-TV Netflix stops working with connections issues to the Netflix Servers as soon as AdGuard Home DNS Servers are used withing my home network.\r\nFirst I thought that some hosts are blocked by filter lists. But the Query Log didn't show any blocked or empty DNS requests. So I tried to disable everything (protection, all filters and block lists), but still the Netflix app doesn't work.\r\nSo I used Cloudflare DNS servers directly in my home network. The Netflix App instantly was working again.\r\n\r\nSeems to be an issue with AdGuard Home. I was using Pi-hole before to globally block Ads in my network without problems.

Ideally using Docker Hub's own Automated Build would be nice. #514 would help a lot with this.\r\n\r\nA (//not yet tested//) `adguardhome.yml` (//Docker Stackfile//): would look like this:\r\n\r\n```#!yaml\r\nversion: \"3.4\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  adguardhome:\r\n    image: adguardteam/adguardhome:latest\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"53:53/udp\"\r\n    networks:\r\n      - bridge\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - adguardhomedata:/data\r\n    deploy:\r\n      replicas: 1\r\n\r\nnetworks:\r\n  bridge:\r\n    external: true\r\n\r\nvolumes:\r\n  adguardhomedata:\r\n    driver: local\r\n``` Your upgrade process would then look like this:\r\n\r\n```#!bash\r\n$ docker service update -d --image adguardteam/adguardhome:latest adguardhome_adguardhome\r\n``` I now have this running at my home network in my Docker Swarm mode cluster.\r\n\r\nHere is the config:\r\n\r\n```#!yaml\r\nversion: \"3.4\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  adguardhome:\r\n    image: r.mydomain.com/myuser/adguardhome\r\n    command: -c /data/config.yml\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - adguardhomedata:/data\r\n    networks:\r\n      - bridge\r\n      - traefik\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"53:53/udp\"\r\n    deploy:\r\n      placement:\r\n        constraints:\r\n          - \"node.hostname == my-master-node\"\r\n      labels:\r\n        - \"traefik.enable=true\"\r\n        - \"traefik.port=3000\"\r\n        - \"traefik.backend=adguardhome\"\r\n        - \"traefik.docker.network=traefik\"\r\n        - \"traefik.frontend.rule=Host:adguardhome.mydomain.com\"\r\n      replicas: 1\r\n\r\nnetworks:\r\n  bridge:\r\n    external: true\r\n  traefik:\r\n    external: true\r\n\r\nvolumes:\r\n  adguardhomedata:\r\n    driver: local\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I wasn't able to use [Docker Configs](...) for this because the AdGuardHome daemon insists on rewriting the config file? It seems the `last-updated` timestamp of each filter source is stored in teh config file. This is pretty bad design :/ Can we rethink this? Mutable data like this should well umm go to somewhere mutable like the `/data` volume?  it would be good to use multi-stage docker builds here. This would help with #513  Here's a working multi-stage `Dockerile`:\r\n\r\n```#!Dockerfile\r\nFROM golang:alpine AS build\r\n\r\nRUN apk add --update git make build-base npm && \\\r\n    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /src/AdGuardHome\r\nCOPY . /src/AdGuardHome\r\nRUN make\r\n\r\nFROM alpine:latest\r\nLABEL maintainer=\"Erik Rogers <erik.rogers@live.com>\"\r\n\r\n# Update CA certs\r\nRUN apk --no-cache --update add ca-certificates \\\r\n    rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=build /src/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome /AdGuardHome\r\n\r\nEXPOSE 53 3000\r\n\r\nVOLUME /data\r\n\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/AdGuardHome\"]\r\nCMD [\"-h\", \"0.0.0.0\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor those on macOS and using [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) you can easily try out AdGuardHome like this:\r\n\r\n```#!bash\r\n$ docker build -t adguardhome .\r\n$ docker run -t --rm -p 53:53/udp -p 3000:3000/tcp adguardhome\r\n$ sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far so good :) -- @adguardteam LMK if you'd like a PR for this? A PR and/or some version of the above multi-stage `Dockerfile` would solve #513 I'm pretty happy with my set-up here. Consolidating all te Docker related issues into one sounds good \ud83d\udc4dIn order of importance I'd like to see:\r\n\r\n1. Automated Builds via Docker Hub\r\n2. Multi-stage Dockerfile\r\n3. A traditional `docker-compose.yml` for `docker-compose up` and \"Stackfile\" (//CNAB?//) for `docker stack deploy`  On a fresh build the Admin Interface 404's :/\r\n\r\n```#!bash\r\n$ git id\r\nfd629be\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee attached.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1312\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-01-02 at 10 22 26 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1290234/50577666-9464a900-0e78-11e9-8704-aa6097c21059.png\">\r\n Is this becuase the `./client/` interface isn't built?\r\n\r\n```#!bash\r\n$ make\r\nnpm --prefix client install\r\nmake: npm: No such file or directory\r\nmake: *** [client/node_modules] Error 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't have or use npm locally so it would be nice if we didn't pollute the local system with npm modules everywhere and unnecessary tooling. is it possible to have a prebuilt dev version committed?  Hi, just a couple of (//hopefully easy questions//):\r\n\r\n1. Does AdGuardHome also have a built-in DHCP server? I notice this in the source code but not seeing any mention of it anywhere else. If so; what is the intended use-cases for this?\r\n\r\n2. I found `tests/dns.txt` but no other \"thing\" that looks like a default config. Where does AdGuardHome get its default config from? Specifically a default list of DNS names to block/filter?\r\n\r\nThanks!

On Linux you can run it listening on port 53 without root privs.  This is the best option: clients still send on port 53 (no wonky configs) and AdGuard doesn't run as root (!).  is there any way to leave the application always on or force on startup in Windows? There is some trick to start program as services in Windows.\r\n[NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager](http://nssm.cc/)\r\nor\r\n[SvcGuest](https://github.com/Jamesits/SvcGuest)  Since v0.92 I'm getting sporadic DNS errors (Failed to read a request from 1.1.1.1:853, cause: EOF)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n`host adguard.com 127.0.0.1`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n```\r\nName: 127.0.0.1\r\nAddress: 127.0.0.1#53\r\nAliases: \r\n\r\nadguard.com has address 104.20.30.130\r\nadguard.com has address 104.20.31.130\r\nadguard.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:10::6814:1e82\r\nadguard.com has IPv6 address 2606:4700:10::6814:1f82\r\nadguard.com mail is handled by 10 mx.yandex.net.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n```\r\nUsing domain server:\r\nName: 127.0.0.1\r\nAddress: 127.0.0.1#53\r\nAliases: \r\n\r\nHost adguard.com not found: 2(SERVFAIL)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Debug output:</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 AdGuard Home web interface backend, version v0.92\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Current working directory is /home/pi/AdGuardHome\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 config file /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml does not exist, nothing to upgrade\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Reading YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 YAML file doesn't exist, skipping: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Loading filter 1 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Couldn't load filter 1 contents due to stat /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt: no such file or directory\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Downloading update for filter 1 from https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Filter 1 has been updated: 500197 bytes, 25936 rules\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Saving filter 1 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Writing YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Writing YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:23 Creating dnsfilter\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Loading stats from querylog\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Starting the DNS proxy server\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Ratelimit is enabled and set to 20 rps\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 The server is configured to refuse ANY requests\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 DNS cache is enabled\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Creating the UDP server socket\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Listening to udp://[::]:53\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000\r\n2018/12/31 11:17:24 Entering the UDP listener loop on [::]:53\r\nproxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket(): Start handling new UDP packet from 127.0.0.1:33900\r\nproxy.(*Proxy).logDNSMessage(): IN: ;; opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 29190\r\n;; flags: rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\r\n\r\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;github.com.

It resulted in a DNS leak (showing both 1.1.1.1 and my ISP DNS)\r\n\r\n```\r\n### pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome -v\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 AdGuard Home web interface backend, version v0.92\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Current working directory is /home/pi/AdGuardHome\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 main.upgradeConfig(): got schema version 2\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Reading YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Loading filter 1 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 File /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/1.txt, id 1, length 502266\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Loading filter 3 contents to: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/3.txt\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 File /home/pi/AdGuardHome/data/filters/3.txt, id 3, length 1772528\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Writing YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Writing YAML file: /home/pi/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:40 Creating dnsfilter\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Loading stats from querylog\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 file \"querylog.json\": read 895 entries in 118.05979ms, 131.91\u00b5s/entry, 0 over 2h46m40s, 183.296288ms avg\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Starting the DNS proxy server\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Ratelimit is enabled and set to 20 rps\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 The server is configured to refuse ANY requests\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 DNS cache is enabled\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Creating the UDP server socket\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Listening to udp://[::]:53\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Go to http://192.168.1.32:3000\r\n2019/01/03 18:09:41 Entering the UDP listener loop on [::]:53\r\nproxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket(): Start handling new UDP packet from 192.168.1.1:17664\r\nproxy.(*Proxy).handleUDPPacket(): Start handling new UDP packet from 192.168.1.1:24738\r\nproxy.(*Proxy).logDNSMessage(): IN: ;;

I'm just wondering where do I place the executable file so I can then run \"sudo ./AdGuardHome\" in Terminal?\r\n\r\nAlso, in my Router is the DHCP>DNS setting, I believe I have to insert the AdGuard Home Server Address there, is the server address just the localhost:53?\r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can give. Hi @mrtargaryen \r\nYou can place the executable anywhere you want but for best practices with minimum troubles, please follow the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Go to /Users/YOURUSERNAME/\r\n2. Make a new folder with the name AdguardHome\r\n3. Move the executable to it\r\n\r\nSince you are going to change your whole network's DNS server to adguard home, there are going to be more steps to ensure a smooth experience.\r\n\r\nFirstly, you want the server to start on its own with system startup, even if you did not log in, so that in case of a power failure the mac would restart and run the server without you being there so your home network isn't disrupted.\r\n\r\n4. Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver\r\n5. Enable the following: Wake for network access, Start up automatically after a power failure\r\n\r\n6. Go to System Preferences > Network\r\n7. Select the active connection you are connected to the internet with. Copy the IP Address that shows there.\r\n8. Go to your router and add a Static IP Address (google it, steps vary according to your router model) to your mac using the IP Address you just copied. This step ensures that upon every reconnection, your mac will always use the same IP Address. This is necessary to add as the DNS server later on in the guide.\r\n\r\nNow, to make the server start up with the mac power up.\r\n9. Open Terminal\r\n10. Type the following command and change YOURUSERNAME to your username.\r\n`sudo chown root:wheel /Users/YOURUSERNAME/AdguardHome/AdGuardHome`\r\nType your password when prompted.\r\nThis essentially makes the system own the file.\r\n11. Open TextEdit app and create a new note\r\n12. In the Format menu choose Make Plain Text\r\n13. Copy and paste the following (change YOURUSERNAME with your username):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\r\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\r\n<dict>\r\n\t<key>KeepAlive</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n\t<key>Label</key>\r\n\t<string>com.adguardhome.script</string>\r\n\t<key>ProcessType</key>\r\n\t<string>Background</string>\r\n \t<key>ProgramArguments</key>\r\n\t<array>\r\n\t\t<string>/Users/YOURUSERNAME/AdguardHome/AdGuardHome</string>\r\n\t</array>\r\n\t<key>RunAtLoad</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n</dict>\r\n</plist>\r\n```\r\n\r\n14. Save it in the following location (don't press save yet)\r\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\r\n15. Ensure Plain Text Encoding says Unicode (UTF-8)\r\n16. Untick If no extension is provided, use \".txt\"\r\n17. In the save as field, copy and paste this name:\r\n`com.adguardhome.script.plist`\r\n18. Press Save\r\n\r\n19. Open Terminal and type:\r\n`sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adguardhome.script.plist`\r\n\r\nSo far, the server will start with every boot and restart itself if it failed at anytime during runtime.\r\nFor the first run, there are some things to set up so you have to do the first run manually:\r\n20. Open Terminal and type:\r\n`sudo /Users/YOURUSERNAME/AdguardHome/AdGuardHome`\r\n21. Follow the instructions to set up a username and password for the server portal (where you can change adblocking settings)\r\n22. Once everything is set, you need to test that it is running. Open a browser and type:\r\n`127.0.0.1:3000`\r\n23. Use the username and password that you just set up in Terminal\r\nIf everything goes well, you will see the Adguard Home portal. We'll get back to it later.\r\n24. Go to your router and set the DNS servers to the IP Address that you got from step 7 and made static in step 8.\r\n25. Go to System Preferences > Network > Advanced > DNS > Delete any values you see there and put the following one in their place:\r\n`127.0.0.1`\r\n25. Restart your mac\r\n26. Ensure that the server runs itself by going to the portal on 127.0.0.1:3000\r\n27. Start adjusting the settings of the server to what suits you\r\n\r\n28.

And thank you for your reply, much appreciated. @mrtargaryen It's good practice to set a Working Directory for such executables with system-level permissions. You are basically 'placing' the process somewhere, like the folder in which the executable exists, as @furunos properly advises.\r\n\r\nThe edit he made is referring to the com.adguardhome.script.plist that was created in step 13 of my guide. The '+' signs that @furunos put is the change he recommends in the script. So in English he is saying:\r\nLook for these lines in the script:\r\n```\r\n \t<array>\r\n \t\t<string>/Users/YOURUSERNAME/AdguardHome/AdGuardHome</string>\r\n \t</array>\r\n\r\n```\r\nThen add the following lines immediately after them:\r\n```\r\n\t<key>WorkingDirectory</key>\r\n\t<string>/Users/YOURUSERNAME/AdGuardHome</string>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember that when you manually modify a system-owned file, you need to make the system re-own it again by running the command mentioned in step 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer:\r\nIt is important to note that, unless they explicitly mention so, Adguard Team did not review or endorse my mini guide. This is simply my own advise that can only serve as a temporary solution since multiple steps are missing to make it viable and secure for long term implementation (for example, signing the script to avoid manipulation, and so on)\r\nThe reason Adguard themselves did not make a more accurate guide is probably due to the fact that this product is still in beta and, once rolled out to normal users, will not require such technical expertise to properly install. Since we are already at version 0.91, the more user-friendly versions should be expected very soon._ @tomiams Got it, nevertheless Im enjoy the challenge.\r\n\r\nOne question Im stuck on, the IP address here is the LAN IP. Is this correct, or do I require the External IP? as it is not to be found in the Preferences Panel under Network.\r\n\r\n`8. Go to your router and add a Static IP Address (google it, steps vary according to your router model) to your mac using the IP Address you just copied. This step ensures that upon every reconnection, your mac will always use the same IP Address. This is necessary to add as the DNS server later on in the guide.`\r\n My example is as follows...\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n  Mac IP: 192.168.0.10\r\n  Mac Preferences Panel > dns: 192.168.0.2\r\n  Router IP: 192.168.0.1\r\n\r\nAfter: (AdGuardHome on mac)\r\n  Mac IP: 192.168.0.10\r\n  Mac Preferences Panel > dns: 127.0.0.1\r\n  AdGuardHome > settings > Upstream DNS servers: tcp://192.168.0.2\r\n  Router IP: 192.168.0.1\r\n @tomiams forgive me for this, I've gotten up to step 20\r\n\r\n/Users/AdguardHome/AdGuardHome/\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1118\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50336539-7f2b7880-0562-11e9-805c-9e09af607f5f.png\">\r\n\r\nThe script stored in /Library/LaunchDaemon/\r\n\r\n<img width=\"924\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50336564-8bafd100-0562-11e9-969b-df8f3b44287e.png\">\r\n\r\nStep 20: \"Command Not Found\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1082\" alt=\"3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50336596-9d917400-0562-11e9-90cc-0194a560796d.png\">\r\n\r\nI've double checked everything, also I deleted everything and re-redid everything and I got the same result.

Please simply take the executable (the black icon Unix executable) outside the folder it is currently in.\r\nSo You would have /Users/r2d2/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome\r\nThe first AdGuardHome in that path is the folder. The second is the unix executable. No more folders.\r\n\r\nThat is not the main problem though. The AdGuardHome executable is fully functional on its own and so manually starting it from terminal using sudo permissions should work regardless of any plist.\r\n\r\nAnd so what you did here was unluckily avoid it throughout all these commands.\r\n\r\nThe closest you were to actually running it was in this step, where you pointed to the (second) folder instead of the executable and so the terminal told you that it is not a command:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Step 20: \"Command Not Found\"\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"3\" width=\"1082\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50336596-9d917400-0562-11e9-90cc-0194a560796d.png\">\r\n> \r\n\r\nWhen you fix the directory issue as I mentioned in my last comment, however, running this same command again will let you finally manually run the executable for the first time, where you will get to set some settings. I imagine as follows:\r\n\r\n- dir  /Users/r2d2/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome\r\n- file /Users/r2d2/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome\r\n\r\nTherefore, the direct execution command is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo /Users/r2d2/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome\r\n``` Now that the first run is over and we got the server up and running, to make it run itself on startup, please delete the current `com.adguardhome.script.plist` residing in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and empty the trash.\r\nThen redo the steps of creating it one by one in order to set the proper permissions.\r\n\r\nOf course since the old version is already loaded on the current system boot, you will need to restart in order to properly load the new version in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the IP addresses issues, I should have mentioned that I was only referring to the local IP addresses that are used in your network to communicate with each other through the router. So the ip address of your mac is the ip address you will use on the other devices that you want to filter through AdGuard Home. If you change the router DNS to point to your mac, then all the devices connected to that router will also use your mac as the DNS server unless they manually change their own DNS servers.\r\nPlease continue reading as this will clear up many confusions.\r\n\r\nThe trip of a request on a device on your finalized network would go something like this:\r\niPad asks for google.com from the router > router asks for google.com from your mac > your mac asks for google.com from itself (the 127.0.0.1 ip which we used on your mac in step 25 means return the request to myself) > this is when adguardhome finally gets to take a look at google.com and sees whether it has any rule set up to block it, if so, that is the end of the trip, if Adguardhome cleared it, it will still need to ask a **real DNS server** for what google.com stands for and so it uses the **Upstream DNS server** that you can manually change, but shouldn't if you don't need to. AdGuard Home's default \"real\" also known as Upstream DNS server is the blazing fast 1.1.1.1 through a secure tls encryption. This is the only step in this entire process that you connected to something outside your network (the real DNS server).\r\n\r\nBut since the website you asked for got encrypted at adguardhome level, your ISP will not know that you asked for google.com @tomiams  My goodness, how I stuffed that up I'll never know. I'll just put it down to the pain medications Im on.\r\n\r\nOk, the Good: Its working, and working well (Yes I thought it would be the IP of the iMac) \r\n\r\nThe bad: Its not auto starting on boot which means I couldn't even open a website without manually starting AdGuard. Also, it did not ask me to set a Username or Password at setup.\r\n\r\nI will re-do the steps as suggested. Also, I have Little Snitch and had to make a permanent acceptation for AdGuard (\"Terminal Via AdGuardHome\").\r\n\r\nHowever, this is what I see right now (before I re-do everything) \r\n\r\nTerminal is stuck at this point\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1082\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-22 at 1 27 47 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50347641-5dde8280-058a-11e9-94fb-94d54d57d293.png\">\r\n\r\nEverything is correct here.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-22 at 1 28 06 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50347667-7484d980-058a-11e9-8eeb-1ede0c4f9880.png\">\r\n\r\n (Edited) Also, I've noticed AdGuard Home doesn't work nicely with VPNs (OpenVPN Clients) on routers. I have a router with custom Firmware on it. I've been using another Ad & Tracker Blocker which is an application within the router, unfortunately I have a DNS leak issue when using it. I wanted to try AdGuard Home as a way of being able to use policy routing. With the ad and tracker blocker I have been using on my router I can only use the setting ALL (traffic routed) through the VPN tunnel. I'm unable to route different clients through to the WAN and others through the VPN tunnel without my DNS leaking (ie 1.1.1.1 DNS is showing on ipleak.net & NOT the VPN Provider's DNS). When using AdGuard Home it appears that I'll have the same sort of issue. @mrtargaryen Good to hear you got it up and running!\r\n> Terminal is stuck at this point\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-22 at 1 27 47 am\" width=\"1082\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23545795/50347641-5dde8280-058a-11e9-94fb-94d54d57d293.png\">\r\n> \r\nNo, it's not stuck at all. Thing is when you manually start it using the method mentioned, the terminal window will act like the working log of AdGuardHome and if you quit it you will stop AdguardHome. It is good for debugging purposes, though. So in your example, it is telling you it fetched the filter x from the the website y in order to update it but found that you already have the latest rule from that filter. So, yeah, all good.\r\n\r\nWhen you get the launchdaemon plist working properly you will not be seeing the terminal window at all. > And something I just tested and realised is not a good thing, it doesn't work with ProtonVPN. I have a ASUS RT-AC86U with WRT-Merlin on it. I've been using Diversion (not sure if you are aware of it). I wanted to try AdGuard as a way of being able to use policy routing. With the ad and tracker blocker Diversion I can only use ALL for the VPN tunnel. I'm unable to route different clients through the WAN and VPN without the DNS leaking. This looks like it'll be the same sort of issue.\r\n\r\nThis needs some serious ordered expansion before I can fully understand what you meant. But here are a few things to keep in mind:\r\nAdGuard Home's main job is purely local and has nothing to do with WAN except for updating its filters _(can be routed through a proxy)_, checking for updates for itself _(can be routed through a proxy)_, and resolving the filtered domains by sending them to an upstream DNS _(can be any DNS you like)_.\r\nIf you are happy with the DNS on your router setup, you can easily point the Adguard Home Upstream DNS there and let the router handle what happens in the WAN.\r\n\r\nYou can let your LAN devices point to your Mac directly to use Adguard Home to avoid being resolved by the router itself.\r\n\r\nIf all else fails and for some reason your setup could not work any other way, put a router that will handle the LAN behind your current router that would then be tasked with handling only the WAN. _I would say, though, that this is the easy way out and there are more efficient ways to build a controlled network, albeit with some expertise needed._\r\n\r\nAll in all, that is beyond the scope of this repo and, unless Adguard Home is the direct culprit, I would say it's more suitable to bring up this routing issue with the Merlin team. @tomiams Forgive me, I wasn't too clear in that last paragraph. It appears that when using OpenVPN clients on any router I use (that have OpenVPN clients) the DNS leaks when using AdGuard Home. So, I still see the VPN's IP Address, but not their DNS Address. \r\n\r\nAs my skills and knowledge are limited in this area I am unaware of how to overcome this issue with AdGuard Home. However, if what you have listed above is capable of overcoming this issue I would be more than willing to try.  @tomiams By the way, I just want to thank you for all this detailed information. It is greatly appreciated. I have AdGuard Home working perfectly well. Like I mentioned above the only downside is the VPN (Client not server) leaking DNS. Nevertheless, AdGuard Home is a brilliant tool for home Networks.  While we're at it, it would be superb to\r\n1. toggle live view while we're viewing the log.\r\n2.

Is there any reasons that tls://1.1.1.1 is not working? When I try just 1.1.1.1 (no DNS-over-TLS) I get the same:\r\n\r\n`Server \"1.1.1.1\": could not be used, please check that you've written it correctly`\r\n\r\nHowever, I can ping 1.1.1.1 without problems.\r\nIs this a bug? Does AdGuardHome produce a log of the communications/errors with the upstream DNS servers?\r\n\r\n2.\r\nUnrelated to the first question: \r\nWhat is the difference between enabling \"Use AdGuard browsing security web service\" on the Settings page and using the \"MalwareDomainList.com Hosts List\" on the Filters page? (Apart from the fact that the first does an online check?) Don't they share a similar database of malware domains?\r\n\r\n3.\r\nOn the \"Query Log\" page, it would be great to be able to specify a time range, e.g. show only queries from 11:48:00 to 11:49:00\r\nAlso, when I want to see more rows of data and select \"100 rows\" on the bottom of the screen, it would be great if AdGuard would remember that choice.\r\n\r\nGreat work so far!

I have found out that when I dig my domain (mail.cfvmail.cf) I get the right IP but from your logs I see 127.0.0.1 and my browser can't connect. I retried and it worked. Firefox was caching DNS records so when I changed the rules they weren't working as expected.  Hoverer before I had changed the rules it was returning 127.0.0.1. Why? The problem is solved anyway  We need to use placeholders in the string #47699751 on OneSky (after the preposition \"by\") because some languages have a different word order.\r\nOtherwise, its Chinese translation will be strange.\r\n\r\n#47699751\r\nBlocked by\r\n-> Blocked by [placeholder] also Turkish translation needs this, --Blocked by \"Filters\"-- means --\"Filtreler\" taraf\u0131ndan engellendi.--\r\nCan you fix this? Well, you have fixed it as the below on onesky.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n#47699751\r\nBlocked by\r\n-> Blocked by Filters I would like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"blocked_by\" : \"Blocked by <a href='#filters'>Filters<\\/a>\"\r\n``` In order to avoid continuing the word \"Filters\", I devised it as a way to shorten the display. I understood your policy.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBlocked by Filters <a href='#filters'>Filters</a>\r\n```\r\n I'm sorry. It seems that it was too early to reflect the result of the translation site to v0.91.  Hello!\r\n\r\nI have configured several upstream DNS servers in the seetings page, e.g. Cloudflare, Quad9, Google,...\r\n\r\nIs there a way to see (in the Query Log) which Upstream DNS-Server was used?\r\n\r\nThanks cool idear :)   <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\nI was unable to use 0.91 on my Raspberry Pi, for some reason the DNS doesn't work and http://192.168.x.x:3000/ refuses to connect.\r\n\r\nI can reinstall and continue to use the older 0.9 hotfix 1 without an issue.\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1.

Correct. Yes, that is exactly what it would be used for.\r\nPotentially, when AdGuard Home auto-update (or GUI update) feature is implemented, the update checks and download could be fetched through the proxy as well. @hmage Thank you for the awesome tip!

Hovering my mouse cursor over the 'Blocked malware/phishing' graph at the top of the Dashboard I could see that they had occurred a few hours earlier.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I went into the Query Log, I found that there had already been 5000 DNS query events since, and as such, the events I was interested to investigate had been rolled off.\r\n\r\nHow do I go about investigating these events in this situation?\r\n\r\nAre there planned changes in upcoming version to possible also log 'block' events in a seperate log file for longer retention?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| 0.9 hotfix 1\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| Windows Server 2012 R2 DHCP\r\n| If it's a router or IoT, please write device model:| Windows Server 2012 R2\r\n| Operating system and version:| Ubuntu 18.04.1 running under Windows 10 WSL\r\n If the AGH UI can handle that amount of data them that would be excellent Such a feature of prolonging the statistics on the front page beyond 24h would be most welcomed for a more accurate overview. (week, month, year options would be superb).\r\n\r\nAlso, restarting AdGuardHome should not reset the statistics as is currently the case. https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/776#issuecomment-499468432  1. Try open google.ru\r\n2. Get \"DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN\"\r\n3. If i use another dns, it works.\r\n4. google.com also works as expected\r\n\r\nCan anyone check it? If for others all ok, then i try more investigating problem on my side.\r\n\r\nPs. I use \"family protection\" ip's.

I'd say this is pretty much done (use docker for autoupdate)  Can we have SSL for the webinterface just in case some guest wants to sniff someone logging into it? Isn't this kinda done now?  Can we have a clear log button just in case someone or some authority want's access to the server? Very important, I hope this future will be implement.... This shouldn't be hard to implement for 0.96, right? I want this feature as well. Yes please, I'd like this also. @davidbdeath @bingobob Click on the \ud83d\udc4d below my first post to upvote the suggestion. Adding additional comments will waste developer time and it will take longer.  Currently if you utilise AdGuardHome for DNS it will always send requests to your defined upstream server(s), even if the queried hostnames include local domains such as `.lan` `.local` etc.\r\n\r\nIf AdGuardHome had the ability to specify an upstream DNS server per domain/TLD this would save a request upstream and also ensure that the right DNS server recieves a request for the appropriate hostname(s).\r\n\r\nWith other services such as Pi-hole because it utilises dnsmasq this is quite simple to do for both Forward and Reverse DNS lookups:\r\n```\r\nserver=/.lan/10.10.10.254\r\nrev-server=10.10.10.0/24,10.10.10.254\r\nserver=/.wlan/10.10.11.254\r\nrev-server=10.10.11.0/24,10.10.11.254\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould love to see this in a future release so I can finally give AdGuard the look it deserves, keep up the great work! Should be possible using the CoreDNS [file](https://coredns.io/plugins/file/) plugin and modifying the [template](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/blob/master/config.go#L239). And then maybe just let the user enable/disable an option to use a zone file which could be modified by hand...? @ameshkov sounds good. But I guess that would be independent from beeing able to add your own 'zones'?\r\nAfter looking at the original ticket again I guess I missunderstood. I was under the impression the request was to add an option to specify your own zones, not DNS servers that should the request should be forwarded to for specific zones... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  any news?\r\n\r\nmaybe you could combine with #473 and #461 I also am looking for this feature. :+1: Commenting to subscribe to the issue and bump it for visibility.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to set an upstream server via filters? i made this workaround\r\n\r\ndnsmasq (localzone dns & dhcp / dhcpv6) \r\n- zonefile local lan\r\n- server 127.0.2.1:54 to AGH (resolvs the rest of the world) YES!

Base language (English) strings need to be added as a separate file: `client/src/__locales/en.js`\r\n> 2. Every string should have an identifier, e.g. `Blocked malware/phishing` -> `stat_blocked_malware`\r\n> 3. In the JS files, we should use these identifiers instead of plain English strings\r\n> \r\n> The reason for this change is translation automation via adguard.oneskyapp.com or crowdin. If we don't do it and keep using the current approach, every change to the base language will basically add a new string for translation instead of changing the existing one.\r\n\r\nOk. I will update it. @ameshkov Please check lastest version  i want to use it on my openwrt router, it only has  18M free space.\r\ni download AdGuardHome_v0.9-hotfix1_linux_386.tar.gz, but it need 18.8M space to extract, \r\ncan it be smaller?  Looking at IP addresses in the Top Clients table and Query Log means I still have to **know** what device has that IP address to take an action, or at least understand the correlation.\r\n\r\nThis request is to include a MAC Adress to 'friendly name' mapping table so that in the above scenarios, instead of showing an IP address, if a friendly name exists in the mapping table, then it will show the user-defined friendly name associated with the IP address.\r\n\r\nThis could initially be a simple manually editable txt or xml file but ultimately should be included in the UI so that users can see the devices already known by AGH and assign a friendly name to them, as well as add MAC address and friendly name for new/unknown devices. Totally agree with this need, I have been using pihole in docker, using --add-host=\"devicename.10:192.168.x.x\", but this system doesn't seem to use the host file to map ip's to names, which is a real shame, as it limits the usability of the information coming back. As a quick win, it would be great if the system could use the hostnames to give IP's usable names.\r\nThat's enough for me. Given the number of DHCP IP devices on my network, I really would prefer not to rely on hostname mapping which is why my initial req was MAC-to-IP. While most of my devices likely retain the same IP allocated by my DHCP server, I do have some devices that are less frequently on my network and thus could be allocated a different IP address from time to time.\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to use DHCP capability in AGH unless it is full-featured. E.g. I don't even use my router's built-in DHCP server because it only lets you assign the most basic features, IP and gateway, so I use the DHCP Server on a Windows Server 2012 R2 box.\r\n\r\nInspecting ARP cache would be perfectly fine for me. Thanks @ameshkov , glad to hear that. I wasn't sure if it was going to be a staggered implementation or not so I just wanted to provide perspective from a keen user! :) Hi Guys, any progress on this? It is very difficult to figure out IP addresses of multiple devices. @ameshkov  @rashidjehangir it will be released with the version 0.92 ( https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/milestone/4 ), and it's close assuming by the replies on each issue although there is still no ETA. > @rashidjehangir it will be released with the version 0.92 ( https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/milestone/4 ), and it's close assuming by the replies on each issue although there is still no ETA.\r\n\r\nThanks - will be a really user friendly feature. Right now its a nightmare to reference IP's Hi Guys, I have added the IP addresses but Adguard Homes says - The system cannot find the file specified. Is there a format that I am entering wrong? I have used a space after the IP Address - for example 192.168.1.1 MyPC Yes- local hosts file as per the instructions  Sure. Pardon my ignorance but how do I share the log?\r\n Yes. I have restarted. Now the error is not showing up but still cant see the friendly names\r\n @ameshkov tried - says \"site cant be reached\" in browser\r\n @ameshkov did it - can see the Adguard interface but its blank @ameshkov Using Windows 10 - path is C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc @ameshkov 64-bit Windows. Another question - do I use a space or a TAB between IP Address and friendly name? I have tried both unsuccessfully. IP -> MAC address -> Vendor name, would be enough for me.  This is what many routers do. \r\nIn Windows:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-sendarp\r\nhttp://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt\r\n\r\nNetwork view tab would be handy. Like in Fing app. \r\nMaybe just like\r\nnmap -PR 192.168.1.1/24 -sn\r\nand for extra info\r\nnmap -v -Pn -A 192.168.1.50\r\n > 1.

Manual: Allow configuring mapping in the UI;\r\n> \r\n> Second, we need to have a separate settings screen specifically for inspecting known clients & editing their properties.\r\n\r\np.1, p.4 are done: we can set name for a specific MAC in UI and we translate MAC to IP, IP to name when our DHCP server is running.\r\np.2 & p.3 are still to be considered. So I basically have to use AGH DHCP server. Not happy with that to be honest.  Hi,\r\n\r\nis it possible to add a function for different client filter configuration.\r\nI want to set different filters for my pc`s in network - do you can make this?\r\n- childen pc with parent control\r\n- different filter for PC/Laptop/Smartphone\r\n\r\nThanks Was thinking same.\r\n\r\nSpecifically around children, being able to group their devices by MAC address and then provide the additional safe search and parental control settings on that group. That would be great to have specific settings for specific device based on devicename/MAC/IP.\r\nI would apply Parent control & multiple filtering lists for kid's tablet, but allowed some resources for my smart or PC. I would like to set different upstream DNS servers for children and adults.  white listing isn't working for cloud.typography.com\r\n\r\nfor some reason when i click \"unblock\" on the query log it adds the rule to whitelist and unblock however its not working as expected. the site is whitelisted in the filters list, however when i check the queries log its not actually unblocked and shows as blocked. \r\n\r\nthe site is uncrate.com that's using web based fonts if you want to try and replicate. \r\n\r\n![screenie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8393299/47561419-49845d80-d92c-11e8-9ebd-4bc13acb2529.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n| Version of AdGuard Home server:| (e.g. v0.9 hotfix 1)\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| (Client > router > Mac mini (adguard server) > upstream DNS\r\n\r\n maybe I didn't explain myself well enough, clicking unblock doesn't unblock it. the blocked host still appears in the query log. \r\n\r\nthis behaviour is only true of this domain, the unblocking works with other hosts.\r\n\r\nive attached new pictures showing the unblocked domain types and the filter list even with this entries still blocking it. \r\n\r\n\r\n![screenie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8393299/47563540-2c06c200-d933-11e8-96db-f72907dae4b8.jpg)\r\n![screenie 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8393299/47563544-2d37ef00-d933-11e8-8b04-1feeb728cb81.jpg)\r\n Same for me...

I have a vps setup with debian 9.  Right now updating AdGuard, especially hosted on a VPS, is a hassle. I keep SSH off on my VPS, so it means I have to go to their control panel, enable SSH, connect, stop the service, replace the binary, restart the whole shebang, then disable SSH again.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if service detection and an update feature was built into the app itself. It doesn't have to be fancy, just store build ID, and check GitHub every few hours if a new release was posted, if there is, notify the user on the web UI, and allow them to download and install it. I know it's a different language, but maybe [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr)'s update mechanics can be checked out - they solved the whole shutdown-update-restart cycle quite nicely, from a web UI. I tried making my own (not very effective) updater, maybe someone can help me\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo service aghome stop\r\ncp AdGuardHome.yaml AdGuardHome.bak.yaml\r\nver=\"0.93\"\r\nwget \"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/download/v$ver/AdGuardHome_v{$ver}_linux_arm64.tar.gz\"\r\ntar -zxvf \"AdGuardHome_v{$ver}_linux_arm64.tar.gz\" AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome\r\nsudo service aghome restart\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nblu@adguard:~/AdGuardHome $ ./update.sh\r\ncp: cannot create regular file 'AdGuardHome.bak.yaml': Permission denied\r\n--2019-02-25 22:24:55--  https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/download/v0.93/AdGuardHome_v%7B0.93%7D_linux_arm64.tar.gz\r\nResolving github.com (github.com)... 192.30.253.112, 192.30.253.113\r\nConnecting to github.com (github.com)|192.30.253.112|:443... connected.\r\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found\r\n2019-02-25 22:24:55 ERROR 404: Not Found.\r\n``` > \r\n> \r\n> Well, you might need to `cp` with sudo as well\r\n\r\nI am more looking to the 404 error Okay thanks, that one worked\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo cp AdGuardHome.yaml AdGuardHome.bak.yaml\r\narch=\"linux_arm64.tar.gz\" # linux_386.tar.gz | linux_amd64.tar.gz | linux_arm.tar.gz | linux_arm64.tar.gz | MacOS.zip | Windows.zip\r\nver=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/latest | grep -oP '\"tag_name\": \"\\K(.*)(?=\")')\r\nfilename=\"AdGuardHome_${ver}_linux_arm.tar.gz\"\r\necho \"Updating AdGuardHome to ${ver} (${filename})\"\r\nwget -N https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/releases/download/${ver}/${filename} -O ${filename}\r\n# sudo service aghome stop\r\ntar -zxvf $filename -C ../\r\nsudo service aghome restart # screen -S aghome ./AdGuardHome\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nnano update.sh;root chmod +x update.sh;./update.sh\r\n```\r\n**BE SURE TO EDIT THE `arch=` variable before running the updater!** Please note, this is not wished for on container solutions (e.g., Docker or Hass.io add-on), since it is shipped as part of a stateless piece.\r\n\r\nConsider add-on a detection or env variable to allow for disabling this.  With AdGuardHome Garmin fitness device can't sync their data. With direct dns all works correct. \r\n\r\nThere is no any blocking marks on log. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

No go still. \r\n\r\nI tested unblock one site and no change, get still blocked. Installation is without script. And I can't get data from Garmin's devices.  With Pi Hole Garmin syncing works.   While we'are waiting for the solution. In case you want to enable rate limiting in \"quick and dirty\" way: \ud83d\ude08\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo iptables --new-chain RATE-LIMIT\r\nsudo iptables --append INPUT --match conntrack --ctstate NEW --jump RATE-LIMIT\r\nsudo iptables --append RATE-LIMIT --match limit --limit 50/sec --limit-burst 20 --jump ACCEPT\r\nsudo iptables --append RATE-LIMIT --jump DROP\r\n```  Maybe even push it to APT repositories or create one for AG products?\r\n\r\nPS: It would also be neat if the AG installation script would ask for webinterface bind address+port and DNS port and would check for iptables and add rules to allow it's traffic if iptables or ip6tables was found. How on earth do I update AdGuardHome if an update comes?  Not all home router have option to change the default DNS server. Therefore each device needs to have the dns server set manually to the device where AdGuardHome is running. It's a difficult task (think about your small IOT devices).\r\n\r\nSo If AdGuardHome could act as a DHCP server and define itself as the DNS server when leasing IPs to new devices - this would be a life-saver.\r\n\r\nThis is the single reason I just moved back to Pi-hole despite liking the sleek interface, the convenience of running the DNS server and web interface from just one binary. This feature would definitely make it a proper Pi-hole alternative. Well done guys! I will give it a try. Thanks for this.  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1. For Example Blocked by Filters about 8200 \r\n2.

Reboot Raspberry PI\r\n2. See ads aren't blocked correctly and filter screen shows 2 filters with zero filter counts\r\n3. Run sudo systemctl stop adguard-home\r\n4. Run sudo systemctl start adguard-home\r\n5. Ads are properly blocked and everything works fine\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nReboot of Raspberry pi should continue blocking ads.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nUpon reboot of my Rasperry pi the web ui works but on the filter page it shows the block lists AdGuard simplified domain and adaway as 0 rule counts. Then when browsing sites that used to have blocked ads, there are now ads.\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1231\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-22 at 8 33 31 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44384328/47327141-fd8a9d80-d639-11e8-8b5f-1c6af37e41da.png\">\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| AdGuard Home server:| v0.9-hotfix1\r\n| DNS Setup:| Router\r\n| Device:| Raspberry Pi 3 Model B\r\n| Operating system and version:| MacOS Mojave Hello,\r\n\r\nSame on debian 9.5 server.\r\n\r\nSometimes it doesn't even help systemctl stop and start adguard-home service. \r\n Hi there,\r\nConfirming this on raspberry pi, reboot stops the service.

I've continued to have no issues when setting the Pi to wait for network on boot, and since fresh reinstalling AdGuard Home.\r\n\r\nWould be good to provide this step in the [wiki](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Raspberry-Pi) for new installs, and eventually automate this setting for #425 when a install script is used similar to Pi Hole.  When following the [guide to set up AdGuard Home on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Raspberry-Pi), there is the section to verify DNS filtering.\r\n\r\nLeaving everything set as default (so only the AdGuard SDNS filter is enabled), using `host doubleclick.net 127.0.0.1` always results in it not being blocked.\r\n\r\n> Using domain server:\r\n> Name: 127.0.0.1\r\n> Address: 127.0.0.1#53\r\n> Aliases:\r\n> \r\n> doubleclick.net has address 216.58.203.110\r\n> doubleclick.net has IPv6 address 2404:6800:4006:809::200e\r\n> doubleclick.net mail is handled by 30 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.\r\n> doubleclick.net mail is handled by 40 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.\r\n> doubleclick.net mail is handled by 50 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.\r\n> doubleclick.net mail is handled by 10 aspmx.l.google.com.\r\n> doubleclick.net mail is handled by 20 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.\r\n\r\nIf I use a different one, like `host ad.doubleclick.net 127.0.0.1` or `host g.doubleclick.net 127.0.0.1`, then I get the expected `Host ad.doubleclick.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)`.\r\n\r\n> Using domain server:\r\n> Name: 127.0.0.1\r\n> Address: 127.0.0.1#53\r\n> Aliases:\r\n> \r\n> Host ad.doubleclick.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)\r\n\r\nIs `doubleclick.net` meant to go through?

I've been thinking about setting up a computer to do some background ad-filtering, act as a VPN server and to act as a Traffic server. Basically; my home network is extremely fast, but I've only got a 20-30mbps downspeed. I wanted to speed up page loading, and file downloads by setting up Apache Traffic Server as a tiny, local, content distributor.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is there any change Adguard Home can be (or might be able to in the future) set-up for other networking tools as well?\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\n\r\nA happy premium member. Sorry to jump in on this but I'd say the second. Combining this with a proxy/VPN will limit blocking to just DNS still, however, if there is a HTTP/S proxy option besides DNS, cosmetic adblock rules can be apply for anything that DNS doesn't block (rules which I'm guessing are currently ignored). This will result in having adblocking within browsers that do not support any adblocking extensions (looking at you chrome for android and browsers within TVs). There's several go proxy libraries out there than can be potentially used. Best one I could find (at least it looks most well maintained) is https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy Wow! You're way ahead of me. This is great. \r\n\r\nIs urlfilter currently used by adguard home?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking perhaps it's a possibility to provide three binaries, DNS only, Proxy only, and both combined. Reason being that people may want only DNS, or only proxy and both combined simply because that would mean you don't have to duplicate configuration and lists and it can all automagically work.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason you've not made a PR to upstream?\r\n\r\n> It will take quite more time to implement something feasible, though.\r\n\r\nTotally get that. I'd be happy to try and help. I will fork both repos over the weekend, and see what I can cook up. I would love AG Home to have built in socks proxy server  Hello. I would like to be able to create your DNS zone based on Adguard Home through its interface. In order not to keep a few dns server. Thus, release port 53 for Adguard Home +1\r\nsame here, can you give us a little more DNS control? Thx +1 To elaborate on @alvussar -- I have a similar use-case where up until now I've been using CoreDNS for my home network and several Docker Swarm mode clusters. I use CodeDNS for two purposes (//three really//):\r\n\r\n1. Locally host a zone so I can have both *.mydomain.com (//which is also publically available via DigitalOcean Name Servers//) and *.intern.mydomain.com (//which is only available internally to my network//)\r\n2. DNS Cache\r\n3. DNS Forwarder (//usually to Google DNS servers//)\r\n\r\nSo it would be nice if AdGuardHome also grew the ability to have locally hosted zones, created through the Web Interface, as well as an appropriate API to manage it that way too. It would also be really awesome if this was extended to PTR records for an IN-ARPA zone and integrated in the builtin DHCP server.\r\n\r\nWith this AdGuardHome now becomes a fully fledged and quite powerful tool to: Manage and Filter DNS, Provide DHCP leases (//with where to find name servers//) as well as locally hosted zones (//for those special enough to understand how that's useful//)\r\n\r\nThanks heaps! (//also happy to contribute to this as time permits//) Certainly :) It's actually quite simple:\r\n\r\n`Corefile`:\r\n``\r\n.:53 {\r\n    auto mydomain.com {\r\n        directory /data/zones\r\n\t}\r\n    cache\r\n    health\r\n    proxy . 10.0.0.1:53 {\r\n        except mydomain.com\r\n        policy round_robin\r\n    }\r\n    prometheus 0.0.0.0:9153\r\n    errors stdout\r\n    log stdout\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now my home network is a bit crippled in the fact I'm unable to resolve any local hostnames :) -- I can live with that for now because I'm loving AdGuardHome in general so I'll just have to remember a bunch of IP Addresses :D -- However I now do have an entire set of internal only applications that are now inaccessible until this feature is added.  Does AdGuard Home support IPv6 Blocking/Filtering?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m running AdGuard Home on a Pi. I\u2019ve added the IPv6 Cloudflare dns servers to the configuration, and they seem to pass the upstream test. I\u2019ve also added the Pi\u2019s IPv6 address as the dns entry on my router configuration. So far I haven\u2019t been able to get IPv6 blocking to work. How come when I run it, I don't get NXDOMAIN but 127.0.0.1:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"349\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-11-03 at 1 07 42 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40008576/47949695-dfa81d00-df04-11e8-8f5d-55a0ca69064c.png\">\r\n > How come when I run it, I don't get NXDOMAIN but 127.0.0.1:\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"screen shot 2018-11-03 at 1 07 42 am\" width=\"349\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40008576/47949695-dfa81d00-df04-11e8-8f5d-55a0ca69064c.png\">\r\n\r\nOh, its because I had enabled the other filters:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-11-03 at 1 09 26 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40008576/47949722-20079b00-df05-11e8-9b0c-1018c312ae10.png\">\r\n\r\nIf you only leave the first one on, you get NXDOMAIN. If I'm not mistaking, NXDOMAIN is faster than 127.0.0.1... Something to look into maybe?  Per user basis `DNS` filtering could be a terrific feature for home, where kids have different rules than everybody. I'm guessing that it can be handled by the `IP` or the `MAC` address.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. Great idea, thanks!\r\n\r\nWill be added to the to-do list. No promises when and how, though. > Great idea, thanks!\r\n> \r\n> Will be added to the to-do list. No promises when and how, though.\r\n\r\nThank you very much! I also would like to see this feature implemented. We have childen too and per user filtering (e.g. save search ON for children's tablet, but OFF for parents' laptop) would be GREAT! \r\nAdditionally, if you could enable a basic scheduler (e.g. block access to *.youtube.* from 5pm to 7pm...) that would be soooo welcomed! :-)\r\n > Additionally, if you could enable a basic scheduler (e.g. block access to _.youtube._ from 5pm to 7pm...) that would be soooo welcomed! :-)\r\n\r\nIn my case I want to premaritally block `.youtube.` across all my children's devices :P  Any ETA on next release (I guess 0.91) that would contain this? Or maybe plans to do another release in between? I see there's still 9 open issues in the milestone for 0.91.

Will be fixed in next release, but right now this is the workaround. @trhdon123 as for 'yaml not exists', that's for migrating old configs from when this project was named `AdguardDNS`. Feel free free to ignore it, the message will be gone in next release as well.  I wonder if you could dockerize AdGuard Home and create Hass.io addon with it?\r\nTutorial to Hass.io addons: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/hassio_addon_tutorial.html\r\nThere is already a PiHole addon - https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-pi-hole - so I think that AdGuard Home addon should be possible. Seems like a duplicate of #377. Need to dockerize it first before hass.io can be done. > Seems like a duplicate of #377. Need to dockerize it first before hass.io can be done.\r\n\r\nThis part looks like done :) : https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/377#issuecomment-430996374\r\n Hi, I'm the creator of the Community Hass.io Add-ons project.\r\nJust wanted to let you know, the add-on is being built. @ameshkov While we are on a subject here... I'd like to get in touch with you (or one of the other developers) for some questions?\r\n\r\nCan we hook up on Discord or something else?  Context btw: Persistent storage of data, since IMHO your Docker images are broken A.F. (or I'm missing something, but the code did not give me much more either). This is now awaiting milestone 0.92 Any progress on this? I have everything ready to go, but just missing the configuration storage location refactoring I guess...\r\n\r\n Add-on is finished now and doing some final tests before release.\r\n\r\nPlanned release for all Hass.io supported systems and architectures (amd64, armhf, aarch64 and i386). Home Assistant add-on for Hass.io has been released.\r\n\r\nRelease Twitter message:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/Frenck/status/1083480233322385408\r\n\r\nRepository:\r\nhttps://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home\r\n\r\n\r\n@ameshkov That should make this issue ready to close.\r\nThanks, @Boosik for suggesting it!

A docker image would be a huge help I can PR this in 6-8 hrs https://gitlab.com/ashmckenzie/adguard-home-docker and https://hub.docker.com/r/ashmckenzie/adguard-home \ud83d\ude01  Done via #392  Please mention me when 0.91 is released and I will re-work the docker images to better support these changes. Hey, I was wondering on the ETA of Docker images. I would prefer to use the official image instead of third-party. And hopefully you can add instructions on how to persist the settings  I ended up building and hosting my own dockerfile on docker hub, but I am curious why AdGuard does not maintain a public image.  This would make updates really easy, because we would all subscribe to `:latest`. Awesome @ameshkov !  I really like AdGuard.  Thanks!! Deploying the current docker image just returns this and stops. \r\n\r\n```Usage:\r\n/AdGuardHome [options]\r\nOptions:\r\n  -c, --config                       path to config file\r\n  -o, --host                         host address to bind HTTP server on\r\n  -p, --port                         port to serve HTTP pages on\r\n  -s, --service                      service control action: status, install, uninstall, start, stop, restart\r\n  -l, --logfile                      path to the log file.

Hi, have you tried running this software in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)? @Daist not yet, but it could work there, yes. If possible, if y'all could test WSL & give us modified instructions via a wiki page, that would answer for techies when in v0.9, while y'all work on a shiny v1.0 native Windows edition. @TPS Thanks for understanding.\r\n\r\nOnce I get ahold of windows machine I\u2019ll do test it under WSL.  NP, but my Disqus post on the AGHome announcement asks for a _lot_ more! \ud83d\ude1a It *does* work under WSL.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/739119/47102204-c0429c00-d244-11e8-9311-016265e1a8bd.PNG)\r\n One major downside with relying on WSL is that it is only included in Windows 10 and Windows Server Insider Preview Build (aka. Windows 2019) so that heavily restricts where it could be used.\r\n\r\nReference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/wsl/about\r\n\r\nIt would be much better (obviously) if it could run natively on any currently supported version of Windows client or server OS. I do appreciate the blocker at the moment (if I'm not mistaken) is in the Go dependency which takes control of this problem out of your hands to a large degree. @AnthonyBe Of _course_, you're right, but this is just meant to be a quick-&-dirty hack so enthusiasts can try it out on Windows.  I'm reasonably sure @AdGuardTeam is reserving v1.0 for an official _native_ Windows release.\r\n\r\n@hmage Any wiki so we don't have to go through _(what looks to be, based on posts' time-difference)_ ~2 hours of trial-&-error?  Agreed! I have a Win10 box on permanently I'd love to try this out on \ud83d\ude01 Given I have over 40 devices on my network I'm very interested to see what AGH can pick up! If you want something working **today** on v0.9, use Docker:\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 x64 Pro/Enterprise/Education users can simply [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). This can run containers natively using Hyper-V.\r\n\r\n- Legacy Windows users can install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/). This will use the `docker-machine` VM behind the scenes to run your containers.\r\n\r\n- Alternatively, use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) with your choice of Linux distro (Ubuntu would be friendly for most).\r\n\r\n- For older Windows XP/7/8 machines, consider [Ubuntu Wubi](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide) which allows installation side-by-side with Windows (and can be uninstalled easily).\r\n\r\nMy AdGuard Docker images can be found here:\r\n\r\n- [Linux x86 - 32-bit](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewrogers/adguard-home-linux/)\r\n\r\n- [Linux x86 - 64-bit](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewrogers/adguard-home-linux64/)\r\n\r\n- [Linux ARM - Raspberry Pi](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewrogers/adguard-home-arm/)\r\n\r\nIf running on your own computer (not a dedicated device), you may want to use `-p 3000:3000` instead when running the container. Under WSL it also works today. @hmage Did you get to post a wiki w/ your steps to install/run AdGuardHome via WSL? @hmage Which Linux distro did you use in WSL? ...still hoping for an update :) \ud83d\udc4d  me too! :)\r\n\r\nWhile I do have it running on my Win10 PC using WSL, I'm finding that the average processing time is consistently >140ms and I'm definitely noticing the impact on general web page opens/loads. Given my PC hardware is Core i7, 16GB RAM, etc. and not under any load, I can only assume there is an overhead in the WSL layer so having native Windows binaries (and ideally x64 binaries) will, I hope, improve performance significantly.

Done in a267dbf625d4e03c43ee76aa066acdd5e5670ac6  Yes, Deezer the music streaming app on Android is showing full screen ads with default Adguard dns.  @SeriousHoax Hi!\r\nCould you please try to re-install Deezer with enabled Adguard DNS? > @SeriousHoax Hi!\r\n> Could you please try to re-install Deezer with enabled Adguard DNS?\r\n\r\nDid it. Same result. I can understand why you couldn't reproduce the issue. It actually doesn't show up immediately. After reinstalling I thought the issue was gone. Then I was listening to a song, locked my screen, paused it after a while, my phone stayed in that position for 30 minutes. Then unlocked my phone, the deezer app opened as it was on the foreground, press the back button to go back then a full screen ad came up. I'm not sure if you will be able to reproduce this in a similar way but it does show fullscreen ads. I can assure you that.  @SeriousHoax if you're an Android user could you please try to clear Deezer app cache in app settings, then re-install Deezer (with enabled Adguard DNS of course)? > @SeriousHoax if you're an Android user could you please try to clear Deezer app cache in app settings, then re-install Deezer (with enabled Adguard DNS of course)?\r\n\r\nYes Yes I did that. I'm an Android user. I cleared cache, reinstalled the app and still having the same issue. Can you specify your system preferences and adguard settings? > Can you specify your system preferences and adguard settings?\r\n\r\nWait, did you think I'm talking about Adguard app with Adguard dns enabled? I'm sorry if I was not clear. I'm talking about Adguard dns only. I don't have the app. Adguard dns is set up in the wifi setting.  @SeriousHoax Our DNS server service doesn't guarantee 100% filtering.\r\nI can suggest you try our app and test Deezer app filtering with HTTPS filtering and Adguard DNS option enabled.\r\nHere is a link:\r\nhttps://adguard.com/en/adguard-android/overview.html#howToInstall\r\n This is impossible. > This is impossible.\r\n\r\nFor clarification, is it impossible for almost every in app full screen ads?

I see only their premium subscription banner. > The \"upgrade\" ad is hard-coded, it cannot be blocked even if you use the AG for Android app :(\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about the \"upgrade\" ad. That's obvious. I've seen other third party apps. > @SeriousHoax could you please make screenshot of ad? I see only their premium subscription banner.\r\n\r\nOk I will share screenshots soon. > @SeriousHoax could you please make screenshot of ad? I see only their premium subscription banner.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot. I got this right after I opened the app. \r\nSnap it from the recent activity to confirm that the Deezer app is showing this. \r\n\r\nhttps://imgbox.com/r7FtpS3F I can't reproduce.

I don't see requests to third-party domains. Maybe this ad is cached or built-in to apk. @Alex-302 Does this help? Check the screenshots and the text file.

HI,In China, all foreign DNS default ports ( 53 ) will be hijacked, and the resolution results returned by DNS will be forcibly replaced with inaccessible random IP addresses. if ports 5353 or 443 are supported like opendns, hijacking will not occur.\r\n\r\nI understand that using dnscrypt can also achieve the goal, but I can easily set it up on the router and use it. it supports non-standard ports and does not need to install dnscrypt.  Hi AdguardDNS, recently when we reviewed your list filter.txt, we found out that our domain was reported on the list and this is false positive as our domain was not ads website, it should not been blocked.

Using another DNS on the TV (Google, 1.1.1.1, ISP) resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nSome particular domain blocked by AdGuard DNS is preventing 7plus from working.\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\n1. Use a Sony KD-55X7000E\r\n2. Go to any channel provided by Channel 7\r\n3. Launch 7plus by pressing the red button /OR/\r\n4.

Thankfully the standalone app was updated as well, so there is a workaround now at the very least.\r\n\r\nSeems to be only related to viewing 7plus via Freeview and something they are specifically requesting that is being blocked.\r\n\r\nI would normally ignore or not report such a specific issue, however the scope of the issue is quite large, as any Australian with a TV who decides to use AdGuard DNS will be blocked access to one of five major TV networks here for streaming. Don't think there's going to be anything that can be done for the moment, going to close this issue.  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Open the Ibotta app and navigate to Amazon.\r\n2. Click 'Shop' next to any any of the categories.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nIt should jump to the Amazon app, passing along the Ibotta affiliate information to credit the user for that purchase.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nA pop-up appears: \"Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later.\"\r\n\r\nDisabling DNSCloak, or switching to a different DNS provider in DNSCloak, like Cloudflare, avoids this issue, and the expected behavior as above occurs.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot:</summary>\r\n\r\n![photo apr 15 4 56 02 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8300089/38783290-fc3bad5e-40cd-11e8-9f51-c9effbe2d77d.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| DNS server in use:| adguard-dns in DNSCloak iOS app (176.103.130.130)\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| DNSCloak iOS app\r\n| Device model:| iPhone 7\r\n| Operating system and version:| iOS 11.3\r\n Unfortunately this app is not available in my region, so I can't check it. I ran a side by side test trying to load Amazon through Ibotta using Adguard, then using Cloudflare (1.1.1.1), and assessing the DNSCloak logs, I believe the culprit is Adguard's blocking of brahe.apptimize.com and/or t.singular.net.\r\n\r\nI'm sure those domains are likely affiliated with advertising, but one or both appears to be required to be able to get credit for shopping on Amazon through Ibotta. So unless/until this is resolved, I have to stop using Adguard to be able to get credit for shopping on Amazon through Ibotta.\r\n\r\nIf you make any changes to Adguard, I'd be happy to run these tests again to see whether this functionality is restored.\r\n\r\nThanks! If I'm not mistaken, that would require AdGuard Pro, right? I haven't purchased that app.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, I've attached logs from DNSCloak from both tests. It doesn't show what was blocked or not, but I found that this makes it easy to identify whether resolution is being blocked: https://digwebinterface.com/?hostnames=brahe.apptimize.com&type=&useresolver=8.8.4.4&ns=self&nameservers=176.103.130.130%0D%0A1.1.1.1\r\n\r\nHere are the logs:\r\n\r\n[Adguard.txt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/files/1915848/Adguard.txt)\r\n[Cloudflare.txt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/files/1915849/Cloudflare.txt)\r\n\r\n That's just how DNSCloak handles DNS resolution - it runs a local resolver at 127.0.0.1 on the device to be able to cache records locally when appropriate. That's why I'm using digwebinterface to test how domains will actually resolve using each resolver.\r\n\r\nI don't see brahe.apptimize.com resolving properly yet using [this](https://digwebinterface.com/?hostnames=brahe.apptimize.com&type=&useresolver=8.8.4.4&ns=self&nameservers=176.103.130.130%0D%0A1.1.1.1) - when would that exclusion take effect? I see that it's resolving properly now. I just tried again and encountered the same issue. The only other queries I see being blocked now are:\r\n\r\ndev.appboy.com\r\nmobile-collector.newrelic.com Maybe @Ibotta can chime in to help? Please reopen if there's new information.  I have noticed that https://duckduckgo.com/ is not enforced for safe search. According to https://duck.co/help/features/safe-search you could enforce safe search through safe.duckduckgo.com.  I am not sure if simple resolving duckduckgo.com to safe.duckduckgo.com will work, but it's worth testing, thank you! safe.duckduckgo.com doesn\u2019t currently have its own IP that is different from duckduckgo.com so forwarding won\u2019t work.  Please consider blacklisting proxysites that help to circumvent the family restrictions. \r\nThose proxies are easy to research even for kids, usually the suggestion to use a proxy service is the first to come up when googling how to circumvent filters. hi @Esokrates \r\ni'm myself dad of two wunderful little childrens... i blocked porn, ad malware etc. pages first on my own dns infrastructur and second on two dns dns resolvers (adguard and cleanbrowsing -> all over dnscrypt)\r\n\r\nthat's not exactly my understanding from freedom of the internet... but freedom of housekeeping (wife.......)\r\n\r\nso i've got a other point of view on proxys and tor relays and this kind of thing... if my children (and i hope this day will come) figure out how to handle proxys etc. f**** up censorship, i'm sure and proud as daddy to teach them every right...\r\n\r\nas i say on my own point of view, other idears are welcome :) @ibksturm I agree with you, I have thought about that too, especially I remember myself as a student in school I got around the firewall there too, not to do something inappropriate, but because of freedom.\r\n\r\nBut I see it this way: I do not enforce the DNS Server, I set it in my router through DHCP. The clean way around the restriction would be to set a different DNS Server and not use shady Proxy servers.\r\n\r\nI see it this way: They are very young and should not see certain things (talking here about 10 years and younger) and I think it may be bad to open the door to easy. Using an online proxy service is way too easy to accomplish. If they are at the level to be able to research what else to try other than that I think they are ready anyway to access whatever they want. \r\n\r\nAnyway I consider this issue to be a lower priority one, but technically its way to easy to render the filtering completely useless without any knowledge at all.  Please have a look at the findings from here:\r\nhttps://hackernoon.com/porn-filters-compared-opendns-neustar-cleanbrowsing-norton-yandex-and-adguard-41f207062c4\r\nDirect link to the list:\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/ztA7HQVE Wouldn't a pretty simple meta-workaround consist of comparing not-previously-classified sites via, e.g., OpenDNS regular vs OpenDNS Family, (of course, w/ some site that the TOS would _allow_ such)?  First of all, a big Thanks for the great DNS Server offer.\r\nCould you enforce content filtering (restricted mode) on Youtube for the family safety offering similar like https://cleanbrowsing.org/ does it (see https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/174059)?\r\nKids use Youtube all the time and I have seen them being confronted with things that are not suited for them (e.g. rap music with very explicit texts). Thank you! You can do this now via the user rules. \r\n\r\n```\r\n216.239.38.119 youtube.com\r\n216.239.38.119 www.youtube.com\r\n216.239.38.119 m.youtube.com\r\n216.239.38.119 youtubei.googleapis.com\r\n216.239.38.119 youtube.googleapis.com\r\n216.239.38.119 youtube-nocookie.com\r\n216.239.38.119 www.youtube-nocookie.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above duplicates the setting for CleanBrowsing DNS by blocking access to videos with possible violence, sexuality or adult content. This also blocks YouTube comments.\r\n\r\nIf you have younger children then you can can approximate the YouTube Kids app by using 216.239.38.120 instead for more strict filtering.

The only ugly workaround is to use Youtube in Safari.  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- If you are requesting a new feature, tell us how it should work in free form-->\r\n<!--- If you are reporting a bug, submit the detailed description using the template below-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example or a clear set of steps to reproduce the issue-->\r\nJust try to access to [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net) with a browser when having AdGuard DNS configured in the router or device.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\nIt should not block access to phpMyAdmin site, that is a well known open source project for managing databases, and not an ads server or anything else.\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\nIt blocks the access to this domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| DNS server in use:| 176.103.130.130 and 176.103.130.131\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| System or Router (same result)\r\n| Device model:| Desktop PC / Galaxy S7\r\n| Operating system and version:| Windows 10 / Android 7.0\r\n Yup, seems to be okay:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup www.phpmyadmin.net 176.103.130.130\r\nServer:\t\t176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:\t176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nName:\twww.phpmyadmin.net\r\nAddress: 185.59.222.23\r\n```\r\n\r\n@samuelaguilera please reopen the issue if it still happens on your side. If so, we'll need to see the nslookup command output. The issue is not with the DNS resolution, as I'm getting the same result for nslookup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nme@desktop:~$ nslookup www.phpmyadmin.net\r\nServer:         176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:        176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nName:   www.phpmyadmin.net\r\nAddress: 185.59.223.22\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as explained in the steps to reproduce the issue of my original message, **if you try to open the site in a browser it will not load**. Returning an ERR_TIMED_OUT error in the browser. \r\n\r\nI tried this with latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge with same result.\r\n\r\n**Changing the DNS servers in the device to any other DNS servers solves the issue.** \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need me to do any other test.  Interesting, here's what I'm getting with a local DNS server:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup www.phpmyadmin.net\r\nServer:\t\t192.168.10.125\r\nAddress:\t192.168.10.125#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nwww.phpmyadmin.net\tcanonical name = 1115546720.rsc.cdn77.org.\r\nName:\t1115546720.rsc.cdn77.org\r\nAddress: 87.245.204.28\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might be the same issue as with custom DNS and Akamai CDN:\r\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/google-dns-slowing-down-itunes-and-apple-tv/ Interesting,  I'm also getting different results when using nslookup with my ISP DNS servers.\r\n\r\n```\r\nme@desktop:~$ nslookup www.phpmyadmin.net\r\nServer:         192.168.1.1\r\nAddress:        192.168.1.1#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nwww.phpmyadmin.net      canonical name = 1115546720.rsc.cdn77.org.\r\nName:   1115546720.rsc.cdn77.org\r\nAddress: 185.93.3.18\r\n```\r\nIs AdGuard using an upstream DNS provider as PiHole does to perform the DNS resolution? If so I wonder if the issue could be in this upstream DNS provider not having up to date information for the www.phpmyadmin.net domain.\r\n\r\nIs this something you can check somehow? It might be that CDN77 relies on the DNS resolution and using custom DNS server might be messing with it somehow (just like the link from my comment). I did further testing using a few third-party DNS servers as Google (8.8.8.8) or Alternate DNS  (23.253.163.53 and 198.101.242.72) and Open DNS ( 208.67.222.222\r\n208.67.220.220 ) I was able to access to www.phpmyadmin.net without any issues using any of these. So it's not about using custom DNS but about using AdGuard DNS servers. At least for the phpMyAdmn site...\r\n\r\nAs in addition to this I found accidentally another site that can't be visited when using AdGuard DNS: [www.elespanol.com](https://www.elespanol.com/)\r\n\r\nAnd repeated the testing with this site, and found something more weird... I can access to the site using Google DNS and Open DNS but not using AdGuard DNS or Alternate DNS. And to add more weirdness I can't see any difference in the resolution results, I'm pasting them below in case that I'm missing something:\r\n\r\n**AdGuard DNS** (Both phpmyadmin.net and elespanol.com are reaching time out when visiting them in a browser)\r\n\r\n```\r\nme@desktop:~$ nslookup www.elespanol.com\r\nServer:         23.253.163.53\r\nAddress:        23.253.163.53#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nwww.elespanol.com       canonical name = caching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com.\r\ncaching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com     canonical name = cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com.\r\nName:   cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com\r\nAddress: 185.59.223.154\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Alternate DNS** (elespanol.com site is reaching time out when visiting it in a browser, but phpmyadmin.net is loading without issues)\r\n\r\n```\r\nme@desktop:~$ nslookup www.elespanol.com\r\nServer:         23.253.163.53\r\nAddress:        23.253.163.53#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nwww.elespanol.com       canonical name = caching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com.\r\ncaching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com     canonical name = cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com.\r\nName:   cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com\r\nAddress: 185.59.223.154\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Google** (Both sites are loading without issues)\r\n\r\n```\r\nme@desktop:~$ nslookup www.elespanol.com\r\nServer:         23.253.163.53\r\nAddress:        23.253.163.53#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nwww.elespanol.com       canonical name = caching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com.\r\ncaching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com     canonical name = cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com.\r\nName:   cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com\r\nAddress: 185.59.223.154\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Open DNS** (Both sites are loading without issues)\r\n\r\n```\r\nme@desktop:~$ nslookup www.elespanol.com\r\nServer:         23.253.163.53\r\nAddress:        23.253.163.53#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nwww.elespanol.com       canonical name = caching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com.\r\ncaching.elespanol.edge2befaster.com     canonical name = cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com.\r\nName:   cec01.use.elespanol.edgetcdn.com\r\nAddress: 185.59.223.154\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if these sites could be blocking users using DNS servers specifically intended to block ads. Is that possible somehow?\r\n\r\n Well, I can say what's the difference between Google/OpenDNS and us.\r\n\r\nAdGuard DNS has just 6 different locations over the world while both Google/OpenDNS have many more locations.\r\n\r\n> And to add more weirdness I can't see any difference in the resolution results, I'm pasting them below in case that I'm missing something:\r\n\r\nYou've copy/pasted the same result 4 times (the same DNS server -- `23.253.163.53`)  <!--- Help us to avoid duplicate reports, make sure you have searched through existing issues before submitting a new one-->\r\n\r\n> \u041c\u044b \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c Adguard DNS \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0443 \" \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0439 \" \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f Outlook \u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u0451\u043c \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044b.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15856304/35849823-901170dc-0b2b-11e8-9623-88a53d4985d5.png)\r\n\r\n> \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438 Outlook 2010 \u0438 2013. \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0440 - Google Chrome. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0451\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439. \u041f\u0440\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 Firefox, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0451\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15856304/35849850-b0b3977a-0b2b-11e8-850d-e8414fd90871.png)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\nThe encoding doesn't change\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\nIt changes to a wrong one\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n<!--- Please include all relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| DNS server in use:| AdGuard Family protection DNS\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| Router\r\n| Device model:| n/a\r\n| Operating system and version:| n/a\r\n  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.

Or Nope not completely Only a few of server I think What we need to know is how exactly is it broken and if there's any way for us to reproduce this issue Ummm it only say I can't connect to internet right now PLZ try again later How often does it happen? What do you need to do to restore it? Is it enough to restart Echo? Everytime Just close ADGuard DNS And it back to normal? Can you access the router DNS requests log? That'd help a lot if we understood what exact requests are done by Echo My Router doesn't seem have DNS Log? What exact router do you use? Edimax AC1200 Bad-bad, I can't see how log DNS requests there. I guess we need to wait for a self-hosted AG DNS solution that'll provide such functionality :( TAT Maybe I'll use desktop and Android ADGuard First AG for Android won't break it for sure, the problem with these local issues is that we cannot troubleshoot it from here, we just can't see what's going on:( @LunarstarPony Are you able to setup AGHome to finally track this down?  Or has it resolved in the intervening (7\ufe0f\u20e3\u2757) months?  Can you please consider supporting the DNSCrypt v2 protocol alongside or instead of the old DNSCrypt.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy @zero77 this is a new client application, the protocol stays the same, so don't worry :) But does it affect your current code (preformance, compatibility, etc.) ? > But does it affect your current code (preformance, compatibility, etc.) ?\r\n\r\nNope, it does not. We may eventually switch to the new dnscrypt-proxy implementation when it reaches stable stage. Great! Thanks for the answer. Where is the sdns stamp produced in AGHome? \r\n\r\nHow to set to drop all requests other than DNSCrypt ? Thanks\r\n\r\nAlthough it would've been nice if that had been clear on : \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Encryption \r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/VPS\r\n\r\nAs I probably wouldn't have installed had I realised that.\r\n\r\nI guess only work around is to install dnscrypt-wrapper in front on AGH but unclear how to setup for DoH / DoT\r\n\r\nHow do I get the hash for http/2 stamp ? \r\n\r\nAnd how to set so that AGH drops requests without the hash?\r\n This wont work https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Encryption#ios if can't generate hash\r\n DNS Stamp\r\n\r\n- DNSCrypt : isn't supported so cant create an sdns I.e dnscloak for iOS wont work\r\n\r\n- http/2 is supported so dnscloak for iOS could work if create an sdns. But its not working; I think the issue is the hashi. Maybe I am not generating the hash for the sdns correctly.\r\n\r\nIs there a setting to drop non sdns requests? To only let users with the sdns connect. \r\n\r\nOnly other option seems to be to install dnscrypt-wrapper and point it to AGH? Yes which means if client didn't have the hash request should be dropped?\r\n\r\nCan you confirm how to generate the hash for the sdns stamp so that I can ensure Im not doing it wrong.\r\n\r\nWould this solve it : \r\n\r\nClient\r\nhttp/2\r\nDNSCRYPT-WRAPPER (if no hash drop)\r\nAdGuard home\r\n\r\n\r\n Hashes for DoH are important. See https://www.reddit.com/r/dnscrypt/comments/a1asu6/dns_stamp_for_quad9_doh_missing_hashes_compared/eapwxkm/ for some details about why they are.\r\n\r\nBut they are not mandatory. If they are not present, dnscrypt-proxy will indeed just check the certificate. By the way, starting `dnscrypt-proxy` will a `SHOW_CERTS` environment variable defined prints the certificate chain, along with the corresponding hashes. Thanks. So that explains why I couldn't get the hash to work. \r\n\r\nAGH currently only supports \"upstream dnscrypt\" so whilst dnscrypt clients will be able to connect with http/2 to AGH they won't be able to verify the hash, wont be able log or action filters. @s-s @jedisct1 \r\n\r\nThink it maybe an idea to update the readme and prioritise the [Feature Request](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/issues/44) Yep I may be doing it wrong. The published public adguard sdns don't appear to have the hash. So I tested by creating sdns with hash for the adguard servers and a test server. All have the same behaviour. Dnscloak can't show logs, doesn't apply filters Don't have much cert experience.\r\n\r\nTest server :\r\n\r\nopenssl x509 -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com fullchain.pem -pubkey | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64 \r\n\r\nI thought this was correct ? \r\n\r\nFor the adguard servers looked up IP, cert and generated hash (Maybe this is wrong) The stamps for the AdGuard DoH servers in the public list have the hash.\r\n\r\n```text\r\nsdns://AgMAAAAAAAAADzE3Ni4xMDMuMTMwLjEzMCD5_zfwLmMstzhwJcB-V5CKPTcbfJXYzdA5DeIx7ZQ6Eg9kbnMuYWRndWFyZC5jb20KL2Rucy1xdWVyeQ\r\nsdns://AgMAAAAAAAAADzE3Ni4xMDMuMTMwLjEzMiD5_zfwLmMstzhwJcB-V5CKPTcbfJXYzdA5DeIx7ZQ6EhZkbnMtZmFtaWx5LmFkZ3VhcmQuY29tCi9kbnMtcXVlcnk\r\n```\r\n\r\nHashes: `f9ff37f02e632cb7387025c07e57908a3d371b7c95d8cdd0390de231ed943a12`  Want more powerful, please add this list to dns adguard, it will help us from indonesia country\r\n\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/heradhis/indonesianadblockrules/master/subscriptions/abpindo.txt @nkartyshov plz add https://github.com/ABPindo/indonesianadblockrules/blob/master/abpindo_adservers.txt to sources  I'm talking about this file:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/cryptominers.txt   I don\u2019t think this would be illegal but ok.

Out of curiosity, given that the workaround of adding entries to the blacklist (but still using the system DNS settings) seems to work well, wouldn't it be easy to simply add a feature wherein instead of manually typing in or copy-pasting blacklist entries, one can input a URL, and the app would then automatically pull from and update the blacklist according to the contents of the URL? (The URL would be in a format similar to [this](https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt), I imagine). @jravid \r\n@ameshkov \r\n@IvanIin\r\n\r\nHi jravid,\r\nI also met the similar issue, but it occurred when my iPhone surfed on internet over my Android phone hotspot Wi-Fi.\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForiOS/issues/528\r\n\r\nIn Taiwan, there is a net friend who also uses iPhone X.\r\nHe wrote mails to tell me that ads were not blocked by AdGuard DNS server on PTT BBS.\r\nThe photo which he sent to me shows that he enabled cellular network and Wi-Fi together.\r\nMine is iOS v11.1.2 in iPhone 6 Plus.\r\nI also met the same issue in some condition.\r\nBut I think that my cellular network's ISP doesn't do DNS hijacking.\r\n\r\nAdGuard's developer said it's because of DNS hijacking.\r\nYesterday, I came back to my home town from another county.\r\nI tried to again let my iPhone surf on internet over my Android phone hotspot Wi-Fi.\r\nThe same ISP...\r\nHowever, the filter of AdGuard DNS server became to work.\r\nIs there a difference between the same ISP's cellular network hosts in different counties?\r\n\r\nBut I still doubt that it's AdGuard Pro's bug.\r\nCan you try DNS Override?\r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dns-override-set-dns-for-wi-fi-and-cellular/id1060830093?mt=8\r\nSorry, its DNS Override feature needs $1.99.\r\n\r\nOr do you have another T-Mobile USA cellular network's sim card for Android phone?\r\nPlease try DNS Changer (No Root - IPv6 - All connections).\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frostnerd.dnschanger&hl=zh_TW\r\n\r\nYou don't need AdGuard for Android.\r\nSimply set AdGuard DNS server in DNS Changer (No Root - IPv6 - All connections).\r\nAdGuard DNS server:\r\nIPv4 addresse\r\n176.103.130.130\r\n176.103.130.131\r\n\r\nIPv6 addresses\r\n2a00:5a60::ad1:0ff\r\n2a00:5a60::ad2:0ff\r\n\r\nView if ads can be blocked by AdGuard DNS server and then report here.\r\nIf ads can be blocked by AdGuard DNS server over T-Mobile USA cellular network when using DNS Override on iPhone or DNS Changer (No Root - IPv6 - All connections) on Android phone, we can sure that it's AdGuard Pro's bug.\r\n\r\nThank you very much sincerely!\r\n\r\n> one can input a URL, and the app would then automatically pull from and update the blacklist according to the contents of the URL?\r\n\r\nEvery AdGuard user wish these.\r\nNot only you, other users also asked about the feature requests.\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForiOS/issues/50\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForiOS/issues/486\r\n\r\nWell, we need a better layout of management for AdGuard Pro's blacklist.\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForiOS/issues/535\r\n\r\nAdBlock by FutureMind does better here.\r\nThe classified groups of filters.\r\nImport filters by URLs and choose to save the filter in which group.\r\nI wish these features not only for the blacklist of AdGuard Pro for iOS but also for the user filter of AdGuard for Android.\r\nHope that AdGuard team can improve the poor layout of the blacklist's / user filter's management.\r\n I have an idea about how to fix the issue with T-Mobile, but we need help from users. Details are here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForiOS/issues/796   Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm the developer of the 'adblock' package for OpenWrt/LEDE (see [here](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/adblock/files) and I'm using your outstanding filter list as one source for my adblocker.\r\nCurrently the following download link of your 'master' branch is configured:\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/master/Filters/filter.txt \r\n=> this seems to be a stale file, more than 4 months old!\r\n\r\nThere is another branch 'gh-pages' which seems to hold the current filter.txt:\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/gh-pages/Filters/filter.txt\r\n\r\nLast but not least there is a third download location with current filter.txt, but with windows line end encodings:\r\nhttps://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt\r\n\r\nWhich one is the 'right' / stable download location, preferable without windows line encodings?\r\nThanks!\r\n  Hi! I have a few questions regarding recent changes.\r\n\r\n1. You're latest PRs on the dnscrypt-proxy repo removed half of your DNS servers from the list of supported DNSCrypt servers : Which DNS servers support DNSCrypt?\r\n2. Regular DNS says it supports ports 53 & 5353 but nothing regarding DNSCrypt (even in the KB). DNSCrypt \"official\" port is 443 (official port for https) but common ones are 5353, 1053, 443, 5053, 2053. I see you use port 5443. Which port(s) is(are) supported by which type of DNS?\r\n3. Do you plan on implementing DNSCrypt for other app?\r\n\r\nTIA  So if I understand correctly, to use non listed DNSCrypt servers one must configure them manually ? I am using Simple DNSCrypt and every DNS server except AdGuard works. Choosing AdGuard DNS breaks the internet and Windows says something about DNS server not responding. > So if I understand correctly, to use non listed DNSCrypt servers one must configure them manually ?\r\n\r\nSorry for the late reply. Yes, you're right.\r\n\r\n> I am using Simple DNSCrypt and every DNS server except AdGuard works. Choosing AdGuard DNS breaks the internet and Windows says something about DNS server not responding.\r\n\r\nWhat exact version of Simple DNSCrypt do you use? @ddhelmet please let me know if the question is still relevant. If you were using ipv6 servers please make sure you've enabled ipv6 in the network interface  done @nkartyshov   Hey. I was wondering when in the near future of the possibilities of an open source release? \r\n\r\nI'm interested in how it works mostly, and for the use with my company. I was looking for something like this to handle traffic a certain way but was never able to pull it off.\r\n\r\nAny beta releases, or more in dept resources of how AdGuard work would be nice :)   Not a typo. It is not Google domain. So you are not blocking Google AdSense. Is it intended? Look\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8361299/31577992-27319ed4-b121-11e7-8a42-6cb7c2f13d5d.png)\r\nWe can't block it completely. A lot of sites will be damaged. Alright I get it. But nothing about the so called non-intrusive ads (in ABP language) is mentioned in your DNS product webpage. Detailed information about your criteria of what ads get blocked is welcomed. > Detailed information about your criteria of what ads get blocked is welcomed.\r\n\r\nadvertising/tracking domains only. Some domains are excluded, because we cannot afford to spoil a lot of popular sites.\r\nSpecific URLs cannot be blocked by DNS filtering, element hiding is impossible in this case.  A user suggested notifying somewhere on the website the DNS server country/country flag. Yep.  When trying to log in to one's personal account on AOL.com (http://myaccount.aol.com/ or https://my.screenname.aol.com) with the Adguard enabled, it is being reported as a phishing page and blocked.\r\n\r\nThe Adguard assistant, however, reports the website has an excellent reputation.\r\n\r\n[screen shot 2017-09-29 at 5 30 25 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32528702/31203797-592b235e-a971-11e7-9760-2d82e7022a5c.png)\r\n\r\nShould this website be removed from suspicious? I think it's been deleted by another support agent from the list a few days ago. How long does it take for the DNS list to update? @evgeniy-ADG The DNS refresh the cache once a day. Now, the website must be available.  I live in Australia and it seems all the channel apps on my Apple TV still have ads.\r\n\r\n**Has ads:**\r\n- 9now\r\n- tenplay\r\n\r\n**No longer work:**\r\n- PLUS7\r\n\r\nI'm keen to help find these domains/ips but am unsure where to look Hm, it'd be complicated to troubleshoot without actual access to the DNS requests log( Do you know how to extract DNS requests log from the router? I did some research and learnt how to log the network connections from an Apple TV.\r\n\r\nBoth the apps with ads seem to be accessing the same domains: akamaitechnologies.com & compute.amazonaws.com - the akamai domain is giving all the video (ads & actual content) while the compute.amazonaws.com only seems to connect before & during the ads.\r\n\r\nIs this hopeless because they're coming from 2 content delivery networks? How would I block them? My router doesn't have any way to block certain domains or ip address' :(  ### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. visit http://beste-apps.chip.de/android/app/telekom-mega-deal-android-app,de.telekom.megadeal/\r\n2. click the link that should lead you to the download of the app\r\n3.\r\n4.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nyou should end up on the site where you can download the app\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nadguard dns blocks the redirection via smartdirect.\r\nthe problematic filter appears to be: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/blob/77511b48223aeff0fd6923adcb0b33e2d10cd608/Filters/filter.txt#L3480\r\n\r\ni understand that this increases privacy but it completely breaks the redirection which i think is far too high a price. usability > privacy.\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n\r\n|   Description  |     Value    |\r\n| -------------- | ------------ |\r\n| DNS server in use:| 176.103.130.130\r\n| How did you setup DNS configuration:| Router\r\n| Device model:| PC\r\n| Operating system and version:| Windows 10\r\n  See the details here:\r\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/1453  In this site video doesnt play when DNS (Family protection) is enabled: http://www.hddizifullizle.com/esra-erol-14-eylul-2017-izle-hd/\r\n\r\nNote: Without DNS video plays.\r\n\r\n![screenshot_259](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19608513/30471048-441f85fe-9a08-11e7-9bfc-8f9acb4d6e24.png) reproduced on my side, could you please check once more? @Alex-302  we don't block that player\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8361299/33794455-30bbfb7c-dcd5-11e7-8246-fe75fbc4c432.png)\r\n  http://freebitco.in/\r\n\r\n![screenshot_97](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19608513/30238926-537ab6d6-9562-11e7-9619-f830fb3935f4.png)\r\n fixed  Hello,\r\nI am comming from this commit https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/fc7be9dd3aac8edaf4c66f410820df0e53ef245f\r\n\r\nCan please merge the below hosts to Adguard [DNS servers](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html)?\r\n\r\nprivacy + ads\r\n```\r\ncounter8.besucherstatistiken.com\r\ncounter8.freecounterstat.com\r\ncounter2.besucherstatistiken.com\r\ncounter2.contadorvisitasgratis.com\r\ncounter7.contadorvisitasgratis.com\r\ncounter8.contadorvisitasgratis.com\r\ncounter2.allfreecounter.com\r\ncounter2.compteurdevisite.com\r\ncounter2.freecounterstat.com\r\ncounter7.fcs.ovh\r\ncounter2.freecounterstat.ovh\r\ncounter2.01counter.com\r\ncounter7.besucherstatistiken.com\r\ncounter7.allfreecounter.com\r\ncounter7.statcounterfree.com\r\ncounter8.bestfreecounterstat.com\r\ncounter8.contatoreaccessi.com\r\ncounter8.fcs.ovh\r\ncounter2.fcs.ovh\r\ncounter8.statcounterfree.com\r\ncounter8.allfreecounter.com\r\ncounter2.contatoreaccessi.com\r\ncounter7.contatoreaccessi.com\r\ncounter2.freecounter.ovh\r\ncounter7.01counter.com\r\ncounter8.webcontadores.com\r\ncounter8.compteurdevisite.com\r\ncounter2.statcounterfree.com\r\ncounter7.bestfreecounterstat.com\r\ncounter7.compteurdevisite.com\r\ncounter7.freecounter.ovh\r\ncounter7.freecounterstat.ovh\r\ncounter7.webcontadores.com\r\ncounter8.freecounterstat.ovh\r\ncounter2.bestfreecounterstat.com\r\ncounter2.webcontadores.com\r\ncounter8.freecounter.ovh\r\ncounter7.freecounterstat.com\r\ncounter8.01counter.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nprivacy\r\n```\r\ngeoloc11.geostats.ovh\r\ngeoloc12.geo20120530.com\r\ngeoloc13.geostats.ovh\r\ngeoloc13.whoaremyfriends.com\r\ngeoloc13.whoaremyfriends.net\r\ngeoloc14.geostats.ovh\r\ngeoloc14.whoaremyfriends.net\r\ngeoloc15.geo20120530.com\r\ngeoloc15.geovisite.ovh\r\ngeoloc11.geovisite.ovh\r\ngeoloc12.geostats.ovh\r\ngeoloc13.geovisite.ovh\r\ngeoloc15.geostats.ovh\r\ngeoloc15.whoaremyfriends.com\r\ngeoloc14.whoaremyfriends.com\r\ngeoloc12.whoaremyfriends.net\r\ngeoloc11.geo20120530.com\r\ngeoloc13.geo20120530.com\r\ngeoloc12.whoaremyfriends.com\r\ngeoloc14.geovisite.com\r\ngeoloc11.whoaremyfriends.net\r\ngeoloc11.whoaremyfriends.com\r\ngeoloc13.geovisite.com\r\ngeoloc15.geovisite.com\r\ngeoloc11.geovisite.com\r\ngeoloc12.geovisite.com\r\ngeoloc15.whoaremyfriends.net\r\ngeoloc14.9cd47096ab1495d8d3b18667f6a52b9c.com\r\ngeoloc11.9cd47096ab1495d8d3b18667f6a52b9c.com\r\ngeoloc12.9cd47096ab1495d8d3b18667f6a52b9c.com\r\ngeoloc15.9cd47096ab1495d8d3b18667f6a52b9c.com\r\ngeoloc13.9cd47096ab1495d8d3b18667f6a52b9c.com\r\ngeoloc14.9cd47096ab1495d8d3b18667f6a52b9c.com\r\nns336739.ip-37-187-249.eu\r\n```\r\nfyi @seanl-adg @StevenBlack @yous\r\n\r\nThank you. @Alex-302 \r\n\r\nLet's do the following:\r\n\r\n1.

Include ad servers from the French filter to https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/blob/master/Filters/filter.template\r\n3.

Hence, trying to include the whole Liste FR into the DNS filtering may cause incorrect blocking due to the nature of DNS-level ad blocking. We'd be glad to include Liste FR as a source if you provide a separate file of third-party ad servers. Sorry, I thought you're talking about the **[French filter](https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/16.txt)**.\r\n\r\n> We'd be glad to include Liste FR as a source if you provide a separate file of third-party ad servers.\r\n\r\nOk, i will when i get some free time :-) @SMed79 yeah, we'll have to include duplicates to the part not inherited from Liste FR -- so that [this part](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/FrenchFilter/sections/adservers.txt) could be then included into the DNS filter [sources list](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/blob/master/Filters/filter.template). Duplicating the same lines in the fork is a bit clumsy indeed, we have to rework the filters build process so that the duplicates were eliminated from the final filter.

Hi @zebrum \r\nI use adguard dns and don't see any option to procced it, it redirects me to adguard.com. It's official of grab.com's domain. You can recheck with grab security team. > after small research we decided to leave grab.co in browsing security filter\r\n\r\nWhy? The website is 100% legit, removed it as a false positive. Hi @NgoHuy,\r\n\r\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. We have worked with AdguardDNS team to get our grab.co domain removed from the blacklist. It should be resolved now. Guys, please note that it may take a couple of hours for the server cache to be updated.  ping to adguard dns always need 150~200ms to get response, it's almost unusable for general users. hope to increase to less 30ms ! @Wyvern \r\nHi! Do you use DNScrypt? \r\nPlease make a traceroute to our servers.\r\nIf you are using Windows, you can run this .bat file:\r\n[AdguardDNStest.bat.zip](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/files/1127434/AdguardDNStest.bat.zip)\r\n Does DNScrypt significantly impact latency? @Wyvern, delay is a common thing when Alice and Bob are far apart. What is your location? should be fine with the new servers\r\nplease re-open if the issue is still relevant  Instead of our build server, we'd better use Travis to do the same.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nhttps://github.com/ameshkov/filters/blob/master/.travis.yml\r\nhttps://ameshkov.github.io/filters/experimental.txt Use gh-pages instead:\r\nhttps://github.com/ameshkov/filters/blob/master/.travis.yml  ```\r\ndnscrypt-proxy[1804]: Chosen certificate #147307**** is valid from [2016-09-05] to [2017-09-05]\r\ndnscrypt-proxy[1804]: The key rotation period for this server may exceed the recommended value. This is bad for forward secrecy.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease, make keys rotation happen every 12 or 24 hours, not every year like it is now.\r\n Dear @ameshkov, issue seems quite simple to implement ([how1][1], [how2][2]), what\u2019s your ETA?\r\n\r\n[1]: https://dnscrypt.pl/2017/01/04/keys-are-now-rotated-every-24-hours/\r\n[2]: https://dnscrypt.pl/2017/02/26/how-key-rotation-is-automated/ @sergeevabc the task itself is not hard, but it's not that simple when you have 12 different servers. I'll give you an ETA once we sit and discuss the next dev iteration with the team, sorry for the delay. I think that we would roll out 24hr key rotation this day or tomorrow, The certificate validity period will be still larger than 1d though. ```\r\ndnscrypt-proxy[1658]: Chosen certificate #150489**** is valid from [2017-09-08] to [2017-09-15]\r\ndnscrypt-proxy[1658]: The key rotation period for this server may exceed the recommended value. This is bad for forward secrecy.\r\n```\r\nDone? Point was to align DNSCrypt server configuration with the officially recommended values, i.e. to make [forward secrecy][2] truly work as expected. So far you reduced certificate\u2019s validity period from 1 year to 1 week, which means a user will not get a fresh certificate sooner until reconnects manually. Why trade this for that when things stay bad from security point? You could just tell us to drop connection every 24 hours via cron job in the first place or to look for [some][1] security-wise provider.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://dnscrypt.nl/\r\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy The validity period stays by *one* week. Key rotation is working daily, replacing old server certificate and allowing clients to stay within established session for one hour using earlier certificate to avoid forced re-connections, as this is not certainly well handled by standard client. Sorry to say that, but these recommendations are somewhat BS, we don't expect all upstream answers being verified through DNSSEC or alternate mechanism which *ensures* PFS in place. For what we've got there, DNSCrypt works exactly under the case what it supposed to cover - prevent last-mile request monitoring and alteration. While it could be agreeable that a year span could somewhat impact the secrecy, talking about theoretical available computing power on the planet, the difference between one day and one week is negligible and there is much more side channels to leak or alter, unfortunately. Please steer this discussion through things which are less tangent to a real security matters :) Guys, I might've missed something, but am I right that the only thing you have an argument over is the cert validity period? 1 week or 1 day? Dear @jedisct1, the very developer of DNSCrypt, could you be so kind to explain why you recommend using short time period of certificate validity (1 day or less)? @xdel [believes][1] it is \u201csomewhat bullshit\u201d.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/issues/156#issuecomment-328243492 Please refer to known complexity values for xsalsa20 and xchacha instead of asking others about the point you are referring to, this is immature. By the way, at least first is quite susceptible to PRNG quality, so the reference to a VPS-based service just above could compare just matching key predictability for different validity period (we are using Vultr too for this service and they certainly do not pass host entropy-collection device). There`s simple not enough DNS queries in the world for *all* validity periods being discussed to weaken client-server transmission in a case we are discussing. Again, please steer the discussion in the way which could be more fruitful as we spent already two replies discussing single define of a single hash function with supposedly known complexity level. @xdel please, keep the discussion respectful, your arguments might be valid, but the manner is unacceptable. `family.ns1.adguard.com` -> TTL = 720 days\r\n`default.ns1.adguard.com` -> TTL = 720 days\r\n\r\nHardly fixed. Guys, I am sorry that I didn't report back.\r\n\r\nWe've tried to rotate it daily for some time but ran into some really weird issues on mobile devices. Every time the key was rotated, dnscrypt-proxy stopped working until it's restarted. Nothing helpful in the log. At the same time, there were no issues on desktop :(\r\n\r\nSo we decided to disable rotation for now and return it back when we test it thoroughly with dnscrypt-proxy v2. Oh, one more thing. This was a client-side issue as we've reproduced it with multiple resolvers, not just with AG DNS.  I would like to suggest adding this IP Blocklist to your filters, this is a good Feed which pulls in from alot of sources and is updated regularly, so perhaps this one or one similar would help to block out the bad sites and improve the malware/phishing protection.\r\n\r\nIPsum is a threat intelligence feed based on 30+ different publicly available lists of suspicious and/or malicious IP addresses. All lists are automatically retrieved and parsed on a daily (24h) basis and the final result is pushed to this repository. List is made of IP addresses together with a total number of (black)list occurrence (for each). Greater the number, lesser the chance of false positive detection and/or dropping in (inbound) monitored traffic. Also, list is sorted from most (problematic) to least occurent IP addresses.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/stamparm/ipsum\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDavid As I understand, it is actually built on top of https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail\r\n\r\nPart of the blacklists used by maltrail are already used by us, we'll check the other part. Awesome thanks I did notice one IP which slipped past your system but is on \nthat blockbuster I mentioned which I reported here:\n\nhttps://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/http-34-250-229-112.22653/\n\nI figured there might of been something missed as it's on iblocklist but \nnot yours :)\n\nThanks for checking!!\n\n\nOn 16 June 2017 8:48:54 a.m. Andrey Meshkov <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> As I understand, it is actually built on top of \n> https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail\n>\n> Part of the blacklists used by maltrail are already used by us, we'll check \n> the other part.\n>\n> --\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/issues/154#issuecomment-308958452\n Maybe it would be best to use both lists from malyrail and iblocklist?

Ah gotcha, perhaps just using the malware and phishing lists they provide would be beneficial to your filter lists and ignore the rest as they are outside of the scope for Adguard? > Ah gotcha, perhaps just using the malware and phishing lists they provide would be beneficial to your filter lists and ignore the rest as they are outside of the scope for Adguard?\r\n\r\nYeah, I'll need some time to examine these feeds, they might have special conditions for commercial use.

Thanks for that!\r\n\r\nI plan to put money online at my own risk to attempt to buy the Windows version of Adguard if its not an irritating subscription-based payment so I can make use of the https ad blocking part and have access to the extra perks.\r\nI swear I can't find search results for \"https ad blocking\" at all,_not even Adguard shows up_,so Adguard is my only option that I know has support for blocking ads on https. > I can't get it to confirm that I am using Adguard's Default DNS on my laptop through Chrome.\r\n\r\nI suppose #195 should resolve that issue\r\n @retrobenny there is a trial period so plz check that it's what you are looking for before.\r\n\r\n> if its not an irritating subscription-based payment\r\n\r\nThere's an option to purchase a lifetime license. Thanks.\r\nTried deleting cache then the site cookies manually but still not showing as enabled upon revisiting the site.\r\nWondering if its underhanded ISP nonsense causing it to not work.\r\nLikely the accursed repeal could be part of this issue with VPNs being the primary target too.\r\nDoesn't make any sense why it won't show up as working.\r\nCould Chrome's blocked stuff be the issue? What does the detection need in order to turn green with success?\r\nI even checked and disabled some stuff and then found that an option for unsandboxed plugins exists and is set to block. This is simple, it tries to resolve these two domains:\r\n`dnscheck-default.adguard.com`\r\n`dnscheck-parental.adguard.com`\r\n\r\n> Wondering if its underhanded ISP nonsense causing it to not work.\r\n\r\nIt might be if your ISP does DNS hijacking and resolves the test requests by itself. Does Adguard on Windows also use the Local VPN method?\r\nThere is no FAQ in the KB section on Windows and it doesn't openly mention the Local VPN method there.\r\nGuess I have no choice and I am willing to pay for it whenever I am able to so I don't have to deal with the trial crud.\r\n\r\nCan you or any Adguard personnel recommend the best option of online payment service to use so I can make sure to stay the most safe from cyber-crooks due to a service being compromised?\r\nI  was in the middle of Googling Paypal and before I typed further I learned about it being breached,should I just buy a standard highly supported gift card and just use that online directly instead?\r\nThis gift card thought was my initial idea accompanying a service because a credit card would be fully retarded to use along with one's own bank account while a gift card has no account trace and can be bought with cash)\r\nIn this case,what brands of gift card does Adguard support the most?\r\n(main reason to but it now is to help against the repeal if it helps at all and because DNS is being dumb)\r\n\r\nI also checked a false site ping and it proved by a no host error message that it wasn't being hijacked by a rogue attacker server,but that doesn't answer the question of my ISP hijacking it. > Does Adguard on Windows also use the Local VPN method?\r\n\r\nNo, there's a more suitable solution on Windows -- network drivers.\r\n\r\n> Can you or any Adguard personnel recommend the best option of online payment service to use so I can make sure to stay the most safe from cyber-crooks due to a service being compromised?\r\n\r\nI'd say it would be a virtual credit card with a small balance (if your bank provides such an option).\r\n\r\n> I also checked a false site ping and it proved by a no host error message that it wasn't being hijacked by a rogue attacker server,but that doesn't answer the question of my ISP hijacking it.\r\n\r\nTry executing this command in the command line and copy/paste the result here:\r\n`nslookup dnscheck-default.adguard.com 176.103.130.130`\r\n\r\nIf this domain is not resolved, most likely your ISP hijacks the DNS traffic.\r\nIf this is the case, I recommend you to look at DNSCrypt (dnsrypt.org). I would prefer to use a gift card bought with cash for maximum safety with zero association of personal accounts,they make them with popular credit brands.\r\nI don't care that somewhere says its safer for credit cards because online shopping scam liability of the account owner is 0$ compared to offline being 50$ on average,they can still get tons of information from credit card stuff and find a workaround into stealing much more.\r\nPlus,negotiating with a bank (and waiting at one before then) is more trouble than just losing a buck or two just buying an online-spendable gift card,especially if I can take advantage of a reload-able one if I wanted to.\r\n\r\nOne issue for Windows 10 though is that VPN is trashed since Creators Update (scoundrels,the one thing they HAD to break on top of Steam game icon links),but does the Adguard driver play nice with Fall Creators Update?\r\n\r\nEdit: Take note I am from the US in case there is an issue with the results all listing the server from Russia instead of the .en version.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Does it make any difference I am using an old-gen wifi adapter in place of my garbage qualcomm wifi chip on my laptop?

That route is shorter for your ISP, that's why it happens.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, misrouting happens, and the only solution for that is to provide more servers in different data centers worldwide. Eventually, we'll do that. Ah,that's a relief I guess though it sucks for anyone else that also can't avoid the issue of it getting misrouted.\r\nGuess since that is why my Android device also failed with just the DNS,maybe I will go for another DNS server for now that works more closely to my area.\r\n\r\nAlso,with that certain CPU issue since June,I really need all of the extra buffs of protection I can get.\r\nEven with the patch (band-aid) it can still be exploited by the hackers learning how the exploits work.  I have some websites where adverts are blocked and the website stops working. This is normal as your blocking the website.\r\n\r\nSo say we have a site say for example a video streaming site such as (i have a ton more sites like this):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.talkpinas.com/movies/pinoy-movies-youre-my-boss/\r\n\r\nwhich i did log below but the placeholders can not be removed.\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/www-talkpinas-com.22411/#post-140560\r\n\r\nMy question is would we unblock that website completely so the site works 100% but also means the adverts get shown or do we keep blocking the adverts and the site breaks.\r\n\r\nIm just not sure how best to report these sites as i don't want to be spamming the forum and i dont think its a good idea to let websites/companies know they can get around your system as they will all do it if you make an exception to the rule ?\r\n\r\nCan you advise please?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDavid One example i have is:\r\nwww.watchpinoymoviesonline.com\r\n\r\nI am only using Adguard DNS setup on my home router and no other adblocking on my laptop and when attempting to play the video on the above url i am presented with an anti-adblock warning to disable my adblocker, i checked with your filter team and they are unable to unblock this, so how should we proceed? There are a number of other sites like this that i have used and i am sure there are more out there other people use.\r\n\r\nThe issue is how do we get around these anti-adblock warnings that block content and effectively break the website on AdGuard DNS, should we just add the site to an exclusion list ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![screenshot_20170614-130350 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11394779/27131539-f8df782c-5102-11e7-8d02-0b4fcaaf9e19.png)\r\n I can get the video to play without using advised DNS and just using my USPS DNS.\r\n\r\nThere are alot of adverts though on the site\r\n\r\n\r\n![Uploading Screenshot_20170614-140641.png\u2026]()\r\n  It would also be amazing to link to https://www.opennic.org/ - giving extra TLDs and extra community support.\r\n\r\nIf I add both, will this service override the ad domains resolved by opennic? Or will opennic resolve the ad domains because AG can't? Hi! AG is a recursive DNS, so to have an extra TLD which OpenNIC provides, we'll need to use the OpenNIC servers only as an upstream. We'll consider this option.\r\n\r\nAlso, we're planning to publish the source code once AG DNS is out of beta, so you'll be able to set it up for yourself with whatever DNS you want to have in the upstream. OpenNIC allows to resolve [censorship-resistant][3] TLDs, e.g. ```.lib``` ([rutracker.lib][1], [flibusta.lib][2], [more][4]\u2026).\r\nWhy do you hesitate to add their anycasts (```185.121.177.177```, ```169.239.202.202```) as upstream?\r\n\r\n[1]: http://rutracker.lib/\r\n[2]: http://flibusta.lib/\r\n[3]: https://wiki.emercoin.com/en/EMCDNS\r\n[4]: https://rublacklist.net/12118/\r\n  It'd be great to have for example \"fakenews\" and \"gambling\" as an option for devices where hosts overrides aren't allowed - hosts files are here:\r\nhttps://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts We will eventually provide people with an option to sign up and set filtering up as they like. Just like what OpenDNS does.\r\n\r\nLet's keep this feature request open until then. @kathiedart, I would not use ```hosts``` by Steven Black.\r\nHe\u2019s a [rude fellow][1], who blindly aggregates various half outdated lists.\r\nTry [Notracking\u2019s][2] ```hosts``` instead, they are examined more thoroughly. \r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues/281\r\n[2]: https://github.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists Fair enough. I'll still have to steal his gambling upstream as I don't care about gambling. > He\u2019s a rude fellow, who blindly aggregates various half outdated lists.\r\n\r\nThat's beautiful. More or less explains why we should be careful with adding more sources. We did this for all AG products in a more gentle manner:\r\nhttps://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard_vs_mining/\r\n\r\nBlocking the whole coin-hive domain is too harsh, it's not too long till they finally fix this on their side and forbid hidden mining. I think blocking of the mining should be default, and the users can choose to whitelist it if they want. My parents for example will click ok to everything. @ameshkov Does this mining-block function on the mobile AG apps, also? Duplicates #283   Source report:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/dorinmoise/status/856965765647523842\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nslookup click.malwarebytes.com 176.103.130.130\r\nServer:\t\t176.103.130.130\r\nAddress:\t176.103.130.130#53\r\n\r\nNon-authoritative answer:\r\nclick.malwarebytes.com\tcanonical name = click.virt.s6.exacttarget.com.\r\nName:\tclick.virt.s6.exacttarget.com\r\nAddress: 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that AG DNS reacted on `exacttarget.com`, I think we shouldn't at least block `click.*.exacttarget.com`  Hi, please add **v.adfox.ru** to blocked sites list.

Hi.  We're considering alternatives to VPNs that include blocking malware & ads.\r\n\r\nYour AdguardDNS definitely is a very good solution for us, as we can use my own VPS OpenVPN server pushing your DNS to our router, dd-wrt PCs and Phones that also run OpenVPN clients.  However, we'd like to have some idea of:\r\n(a) Do you have a schedule when you will be out of beta?\r\n(b) I assume you will offer Premium services, similar to your Adguard apps for Windows and Androids.  Can you give me you present inclinations on pricing?  The apps seem to have an advantage of being able to switch off adblocking on some pages that otherwise won't load, but the DNS product is much better for use on all our devices.\r\n\r\nRight now, we are looking at AdguardDNS, Adguard apps, and PIA (Private Internet Access) with MACE.  With our 5 devices (2 PCs, 2 Androids, 1 DD-WRT router) your apps a bit expensive (needs 3 licenses?) but still worth our consideration.\r\n\r\nAny comments would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks for this product.  Hi.  I read that malware, as well as ads and spyware, are filtered, but I do not see any malware lists on this site?  For example, do you filter (at least once a day?) using IPs such as\r\nhttp://malc0de.com/bl/IP_Blacklist.txt\r\nhttps://lists.blocklist.de/lists/strongips.txt\r\nhttps://www.openbl.org/lists/base_30days.txt.gz\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThanks.  I posted this to https://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/adguard-dns-beta.12162 , but it seems that this is the proper place to address this topic.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for this service. I've put this on my Ubuntu 16.04 VPS running an OpenVPN-2.4 Server, and OpenVPN-2.4 clients on:\r\na dd-wrt router, two Windows 10 x64 Pro PCs, and two Android 7.1.1 phones.\r\n\r\nThe lags relative to OpenDNS are not as bad at all as I expected.\r\n\r\nI have some concerns about DNS resolutions that I see on the following two sites, accessed from a Windows PC, and would appreciate some explanation, i.e., are these **really** the DNS servers you use:\r\n\r\ndnsleak.net:\r\nNS Addresses detection -

Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nSince I have not seen DNS servers outside the US used for requests from within the US, using other sets of DNS settings (Linode, Norton, OpenDNS, Google, Zenmate, Verizon, etc.), I still am surprised that several non-US servers show up under dnsleak.net and dnsleaktest.com?\r\n\r\nFrom your reply, this should not be happening? They could be using Geocast methodology for multiple DNS resolution entries. Can we close this one as it looks like the question has been answered or am i wrong ? Yeah, closing it, thank you! Another example of such detection: https://www.grc.com/dns/dns.htm\r\n\r\n----\r\n> 2. Then they go through all known DNS servers and check if this unique domain name is cached by any of them.\r\n> 3.

I dont see why there is a need to remove it though\n Done.\n  1. Done\n2. Done\n3. @mmigi will do it soon\n4. Done\n If people use the adguard dns filter list it completely whitelists some sites that should only be whitelisted if someone is using the dns servers. For example scorecardresearch.com in the dns exceptions list, meaning it will be whitelisted completely when using the filter list. Anyway to disable that?\n 3 - Done !\n @jo2dan23 no, as far as I know. Exception rules have priority over other rules, so if you have Adguard DNS filter enabled and there is an exception in it for some website, this website will be whitelisted no matter what other filters do you have.\n Also, finished with 3), closing the issue.\n @vbagirov Unfortunately you made a copy paste mistake on https://adguard.com/en/filters.html#dns\n\nThe [`View all the rules`](https://adguard.com/en/filter-rules.html?id=12) link brings you to the \"Adguard Safari Filter\"\n\nBTW: Thousand thanks to the one of you that wrote the blog post explaining filter rules it really helped a lot getting away from the Adguard Assistant generated rules \u2665\n @Bluscream thanks, fixed now.\n  I would like to recommend a block page for Adguard DNS that shows when a\r\npage/window/tab/et cetera is blocked, and that this block page will show\r\nwhat blocked it and why it was blocked and have an option to report false\r\npositives.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that Adguard DNS seems to block some pop-up ads and\r\naccidentally blocks some legitimate links when they try to open a new tab\r\nor window, the tab or windows still open but they do not load, but there is\r\nno block page to let you know what blocked it or why and you can not report\r\nfalse positives. > Thank you for explaining that (you reasoning makes sense when you say it\n> that way), I hope that one day in the future it will be possible to know\n> for sure if a pop-up ad was blocked by Adguard DNS or not and why and to be\n> able to report false positives, but for now I will have to keep guessing\n> when a pop-up ad was blocked by Adguard DNS and I guess I will have\n> manually report every false positive by submitting a ticket each time?\n  Its a good point if Adguard DNS supports ECS.\n OpenDNS supports too.\n  www.mediametrics.ru not working in yandex browser  connection failure\n  DNS configured through the router.\nProvider \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\nPing increases from 40 to 80\n\nTraceroute screenshots\nDisabled DNS\n<details>\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20476168/19653740/4b27fe7a-9a1e-11e6-89a7-d56b32d99d2d.png)\n</details>\nEnabled\n<details>\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20476168/19653780/70db8588-9a1e-11e6-99b8-4f57a1ba829f.png)\n</details>\n\nID 1071591\n @Fridrix is this still an issue?  Hi, \nfirst of all, thanks for this wonderful service.\n\nI do have a small problem, which might've been mentioned before (can't find it though): the Google Play Store won't download with the DNS set at AdGuard.\n Oh, I'm sorry.\nThis was on Android\n I'm using https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burakgon.dnschanger\n The item just stays stuck at 'downloading' but nothing happens. \nJust happened again at home (wifi)\n Thanks for the feedback. It's not really random at my phone though, it happens each and every time. Same goes for Gmail attachments. Unfortunately that makes the DNS servers, at least for me, pretty unusable at the moment. \n\nAre you talking about this bug report? https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=33666\n Since not explicitly mentioned, the tracking issues are @: \n\nAndroid < N|7: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/186\nAndroid \u2265 N|7: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardForAndroid/issues/597\n  bnc.lt should be added to exceptions.

It seems the process transited via _Skytiz Network_ which is why it was blocked by PeerBlock. Is this normal?\n\nPeerblock blocked 87.245.196.91 named as _Skytiz Network_ and 87.245.196.91 is part of PeerBlock's _Webexploit_ filters' list. This list is described at https://www.iblocklist.com/list?list=ghlzqtqxnzctvvajwwag as:\n\n> List name: webexploit\n> Author: Bluetack\n> Author's website: bluetack.co.uk\n> Author's description:\n> IP addresses related to current web server hack and exploit attempts that have been logged by us or can be found in and cross referenced with other related IP databases. Malicious and other non search engine bots will also be listed here, along with anything we find that can have a negative impact on a website or webserver such as proxies being used for negative SEO hijacks, unauthorised site mirroring, harvesting, scraping, snooping and data mining / spy bot / security & copyright enforcement companies that target and continuosly scan webservers.\n\nSo, is there a problem and if so, where is it?\nThis was for your information. Interpreting these facts is above my skills.\nThanks\n Perhaps you're answering to my post's title only, Alex-202.\nI've developed my comment if you read me carefully to point out that pluzz.francetv.fr was blocked by PeerBlock and that PeerBlock was blocking one of AdGuards distribution servers, 87.245.196.91 named as _Skytiz Network_\n\nMoreover, having a look at https://dnsleaktest.com/ showed several DNS servers (which is good for speed) but that ALL these servers were Google servers. If Adguard DNS is hopping from one Google server to another to resolve my quest then it's not for me.\n\nGood luck.\n @ameshkov , OK, but the point remains all this would have been transparent if the Webexploit filters' list of PeerBlock hadn't blocked 87.245.196.91 - The question is to know if this **87.245.196.91 is founded or not to appear in this Webexploit's list**. That is the only question.\n Often maybe not, but this can happen, indeed. As it may not. Incertitude.\nThanks for your concern.\nI don't think you should close this thread, it concerns unresolved matter, other users could include their knowledge/experience.

I am sorry for the delays, we're a bit limited in resources, and I'd like not to switch to DNS tasks until we can really focus on them. No worries!  Just figuring, since [DNSCrypt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardDNS/issues/118) got done, perhaps this got some love as well.  Keep on \ud83d\ude9aing! \ud83d\udce3 Any update on this?  @evilvibes we don't want to touch the current installation until the updated version is ready. That's why this issue is still open.

Hi there, any news about dnssec?\r\n\r\nand do you think hheres a opinion do start a server in central europe example frankfurt or zurich?\r\n\r\ngreets Central Europe Server would be great, yes \ud83d\udc4d  jupp, would be great, so my route don't have to go over the half of the world as i wrote months ago ^^ Any updates on this issue? DNSSEC is very important and has been receiving increased attention lately, including as a part of Cloudflare's Crypto Week 2018 (https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-provision-and-maintain-dnssec/). I was planning to open also a DNSSEC Request but since there is already one, one more who wishes this option news? i looks as the way i'm running AGH dnssec looks like running Do you have any news ? it's a big feature now for a DNS server.

Malware page alert actual design is not compatible with smartphones, letters show very small.\n\nI think its better a smartphone compatible or responsive design.\n Thanks.\n  I see that page web alerts is working, dns shows a alert when anybody try to navigate to a malicious url.\n\nMy suggestion is that alert can bypass clicking on a link. \n\nThe problem is that if the alert is a false positive users have to change dns to access it.\n\n![adguarddns2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22648547/19142204/0a37c156-8b9c-11e6-8b78-dea4be87291a.jpg)\n Ok, thank you very much.\n  settings.crashlytics.com Is on amazon app and whisper app and ifunny app\n e.crashlytics.com is on whisper app\n api.branch.io is also located in whisper app. Its a metrics thing found on Google\n iadsdk.apple.com is another ad domain that should be blocked used by apple mostly on all apps with ads\n adserver.snapads.com Isnt being blocked on snapchat app for iphone\n mobileanalytics.us-east-1.amazonaws.com is another that appeared in my logs\n Thanks for the fast response how long does it take for it to take effect?

May let people allow to connect anonymously and even use it if behind firewall or as a bridge for people have ipv6 only connection with issue of ipv4 resolver connectivity as found in other issue for example add Hiddenservice address like adguard1dns5443.onion as a DNS/-Crypt resolver\nSure DNS is based on UDP by default and this support only tcp. but as you are dnscrypt enabled! Which is great. It works with your server on port TCP with dnscrypt-proxy -T (command line agrument). That works fine on anycast IP by now.\nThere is already dnscrypt resolvers offering this hidden for few years. \n\nIf fearing latency there still is some improvement along default config, first easiest is local dns cache.. \n\nhttps://adguard.com/en/privacy.html#website\n\n> `Information we collect when you use Adguard DNS\n> \n> When you use Adguard DNS browser sends the following information to our server:\n> \n> IP-address.\n> DNS request containing domain name.\n> We, in our turn, do not log or save any information.

But my english isn\u00b4t perfect for explaining this things sorry.\nYes, one of the first dnscrypt resolvers does support. \n\n i quote whole page because cert expired by date and sadly service half broken so this may be a bad example today at least for dnscrypt. it worked very well in past years.\nBut the list lists only cloudns-syd actually and i cannot reach it by onion. cloudns-au is connectable.\n\ncloudns@ https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv\n\nConnect:\ndnscrypt-proxy does not support socks5 yet. you would need to socksify it to tor manually. \ndnscrypt-proxy does not support  domain names in resolvers! so no onion address.\nBut tor can map its address. just put into torrc config file the following:\n`MapAddress  113.20.6.2         gc2tzw6lbmeagrp3.onion\n\nMapAddress  113.20.8.17     l65q62lf7wnfme7m.onion`\n\nhttps://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en\n\n> MapAddress address newaddress\n\nnow you can even use any dns query forwarded to 113.20.6.2:443 without dnscrypt standard dns is enabled also and it goes through hidden service resolver. \n\nit works as os resolver with unboud tcp upstream configered forward-server 113.20.6.2:443 if unbound outbound connection goes through torsocks port\n\n> > -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\n> > Hash: SHA1\n> \n> 09/06/2015 - This signed text was written for https://cloudns.com.au\n> \n>  --Announcement--\n> \n> Welcome to CloudNS!\n> \n> CloudNS is an australian based security focused DNS provider.\n> \n> Currently our DNS hosting and Email infrustructure is under\n> construction, however our public DNS resolver is now online!\n> \n>  --Information--\n> \n> Primary Server (Canberra, Australia):\n> \n> Address: 113.20.6.2:443 or gc2tzw6lbmeagrp3.onion:443\n> Provider name: 2.dnscrypt-cert.cloudns.com.au\n> DNSCrypt Key:\n> 1971:7C1A:C550:6C09:F09B:ACB1:1AF7:C349:6425:2676:247F:B738:1C5A:243A:C1CC:89F4\n> \n> Secondary Server (Sydney, Australia):\n> \n> Address: 113.20.8.17:443 or l65q62lf7wnfme7m.onion:443\n> Provider name: 2.dnscrypt-cert-2.cloudns.com.au\n> DNSCrypt Key:\n> 67A4:323E:581F:79B9:BC54:825F:54FE:1025:8B4F:37EB:0D07:0BCE:4010:6195:D94F:E330\n> \n>  --Features--\n> \n> Our DNS resolvers have many security relevant features and other\n> benefits:\n> - DNSCrypt Support\n>   We only allow connections to our service using DNSCrypt, this\n>   provides confidentially and message integrity to our DNS\n>   resolver, and makes it harder for an adversery watching the\n>   traffic of our resolver to identify the origin of a DNS query as\n>   all the traffic is mixed together.\n> - DNSSEC Validation\n>   Our server does complete trust validation of DNSSEC enabled\n>   names, protecting you from upstream dns poisoning attacks or\n>   other DNS tampering.

Yes when I made the comment here the site prompted me to disable my Adblocker in order to browse the site. In recent days many Indian news sites made very aggressive usage of  Anti-Adblocker scripts which they updates them frequently in order to bypass Adblockers attempts to bypass them. \n\nThank You\n  I like the idea of the Adguard DNS, and I was trying the Family Protection servers.  However, I've encountered too many links (like hyperlinks from emails) that won't load.\n\nFor now, I've switched to the OpenDNS Familyshield servers.\n\nI suggest you add a block page when a page is blocked by the DNS server, and provide a link for reporting a page/domain that is believed to be blocked in error.\n FYI OpenDNS has a block page which can be customized and include a way to contact the administrator.\n @ameshkov This [support page](https://support.opendns.com/entries/21909235-Blocking-https-site) says https is blocked (as is http). I suppose they also display the block page.\n done\n  Can't reproduce with family protection.\nIt is slow, but video works:\n![1](http://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7720/b5XtUc.png)\nAdguard filters are disabled.\n You might be Right. I tried in Chrome on iPhone with DNS enabled and it works. In Safari its spinning and spinning\n @tosbsas \ncould you send me your content blocker?(through  the support.

Is the issue still exists when you disable DNS filtering?\n The video plays fine for me on adguard DNS default settings can we close this as it's now resolved? with both Adguard default and Family Protection DNS video plays ok in safari.  https://adguard.com/ru/adguard-dns/instruction.html#android\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15856304/17983166/ea8c39de-6b13-11e6-924e-18194e765aae.png)\n\n<details>\nnot sure if I've posted it in the correct project\n  isn\u00b4t it anycasted anyway?\n I know you guys added the two in Netherlands have you added the NY and SF servers yet? Can we close this ticket as it's complete then?  Unblocking Disqus on that link seems to deadlock my browser consistently (transcript/translation requested, please :pray:), so I can't tell if this was brought up, but is this issue requesting IPv6 DNS address:\n- _equivalents_ for the resolvers, for those who want/need IPv6 addresses for 176.103.130.130, 176.103.130.131, 176.103.130.132, & 176.103.130.134?\n- _resolution/filtering_ so that all the functionality for IPv4 DNS replies is also provided for IPv6 1s?\n\nI'd like both, so I can test replacing my current OpenDNS settings everyplace.  Particularly, Windows's IPv6 implementation wants IPv6-formatted DNS addresses.\n ~~Why wouldn't simple address conversion like @ http://www.ipaddressguide.com/ipv4-to-ipv6 \"just work\"?~~\n ~~I ended up using http://en.toolpage.org/tool/ipv4-to-ipv6 to bulk-convert~~\n\n~~176.103.130.130~~\n~~176.103.130.131~~\n~~176.103.130.132~~\n~~176.103.130.134~~\n\n~~to~~\n\n~~0:0:0:0:0:ffff:b067:8282~~\n~~0:0:0:0:0:ffff:b067:8283~~\n~~0:0:0:0:0:ffff:b067:8284~~\n~~0:0:0:0:0:ffff:b067:8286~~\n\n~~which is, of course, same as~~\n\n~~::ffff:b067:8282~~\n~~::ffff:b067:8283~~\n~~::ffff:b067:8284~~\n~~::ffff:b067:8286~~\n\n~~D'y'all mind testing?~~ I'm not (yet) using AGDNS, but probably will soon.\n These look like local adresses\n They look like adresses used in an own LAN / WLAN network, not WAN ips\n The ISP needs to assign ipv6 adresses for the dns servers\n Damn i wish ag ipv6 dns would be a thing now :) I'm not certain if this is still an open issue, but is there a roadmap that estimates when AdGuard DNS will have its own IPv6 addresses as well as the tried and true IPv4? Many thanks At the moment we use two different hosting providers. One of them provides IPv6 connectivity and the other one does not. \r\n\r\nThe other problem is that we don't own an IPv6 block and using some random address is not an option.\r\n\r\nSo, once we buy an IPv6 addresses block, we can use it for at least some servers.\r\n\r\n@vbagirov need you to assist me on this. Are there any news about IPv6 Adguard DNS addresses? As soon as there are IPV6 addresses, I'm going to switch all my devices over as I'm unable to control the IPv6 DNS on my gateway. Being able to add the Adguard DNS IPv6 to my devices to override it would be wonderful. We've acquired an IPv6 addresses block, so we're close. @ameshkov Can you update readme with the now [available](https://blog.adguard.com/en/dns-ipv6-support/) IPv6 addresses ?

I have only used Adguard DNS (176.103.130.130, 176.103.130.131) with a\n   few websites because I have to disable it just to search for items on\n   http://www.walmart.com/ , and so this is the first website that I have\n   noticed with a problem when using Adguard DNS so far; but I have not gotten\n   to test Adguard DNS on many websites yet.\n2. I can only give steps for one of the problems because if Adguard DNS is\n   enabled before searching for an item, I can not get to the other problem,\n   and so all you have to do is go to http://www.walmart.com/ , go to the\n   search area, type in what item you want to search for, and try to start the\n   search (clicking the magnifying glass icon on the right side of the search\n   area or hitting the enter key on your keyboard) but it will not work with\n   Adguard DNS enabled. I have tested this in the latest Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on\n   Windows 10.\n3. I do not think that the default Adguard DNS IPs/DNS servers should be set\n   to block trackers (the spyware list), that list is more likely to break\n   websites usually so that is one of the reasons that I do not use it even\n   with the Adguard extension or other adblocking extensions to decrease the\n   chance of breaking some functionality on websites, and so I think that the\n   default IPs/DNS servers for Adguard should only focus on blocking ads and\n   malicious/phishing/scam/grayware/adware/et cetera websites.\n   **1285994**\n\n// Our agent has tested this at his end and was unable to reproduce the issue.\n ```\nC:\\Users\\Alex>ping omniture.walmart.com\n\n\u041e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0441 walmart.com.d1.sc.omtrdc.net [::1] \u0441 32 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445:\n\u041e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442 ::1: \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f<1\u043c\u0441\n```\n\nIt is blocked by `||omtrdc.net`\nAdded to exclusions\n\n```\n@@||omniture.walmart.com^\n@@||omtrdc.net^\n```\n  Happened in stable Win 10.\n\nMore info here and in other comments below:\nhttps://forum.adguard.com/index.php?threads/12163/page-2#post-92791\n Tried, but nothing.\nI found few blocked domains\n\n```\nc.msn.com\nb.scorecardresearch.com\nat.atwola.com\nb.grvcdn.com\ncdn.at.atwola.com\n```\n\nbut when I try to completely block them by Adguard for Windows, I can't reproduce this issue.\n and these\n\n```\ndb5.settings.data.microsoft.com.akadns.net\na104-84-176-55.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com - blocked by family protection\n```\n done\n it seems that it happened again\r\nid 1502400\r\n\"when I leave my pc to auto on the dns servers so it just uses the routers dns (adguard dns), it doesn't work.
