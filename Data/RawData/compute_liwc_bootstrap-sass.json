[{"repo": "bootstrap-sass", "type": "elite", "title": "", "number of text": 728, "text": "  Closing due to https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/14630\n  The error is coming from ExecJS and is unrelated to Bootstrap Sass.

However, since the mixins were split into separate files, it's broken anyway, so I guess we can remove the extra file. However, the change has to be made on the converter level. I'll do it for the next release.\n  For you app, you can simply add bootstrap-sass-official/assets/fonts to the load path (#592).\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.assets.paths << Rails.root.join(*%w(assets components bootstrap-sass-official assets fonts)\n```\n\nA better solution would be improve Sprockets with support for relative paths in `depend_on`, so bootstrap-sass can `depend_on ../fonts/bootstrap...`. Last time I checked relative paths refused to work with `depend_on`, but this was a few months ago.\n Because it does not work, see https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/issues/241\n  It is compatible with Rails 4 already, via https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/engine.rb#L6\n  Looks like you have set $font-size-small to an empty value, please [see the source](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_type.scss#L80).\n  I use RubyMine as well and would love for it to be fixed on their side. RubyMine at the minimum should allow customizing asset load paths, at best it could inspect `Rails.application.config.asset.paths`.  There is an open issue on the RubyMine tracker: http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RUBY-15585\n  Where does `less` in the path come from? It's wrong and it's not coming from bootstrap-sass.\n  I am not sure how ember-cli handles assets, but perhaps this discussion on ember-cli issue tracker will be of use: https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/pull/680. \n  This bug is present in an old version of sprockets (https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/issues/137). Upgrading middleman-sprockets and sprockets to the latest versions may help. \n `gem list` list all the gems installed, but what is in Gemfile.lock? This looks the same as this issue with sprockets-sass 1.1.0, fixed in 1.2.0 https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-sass/issues/27\n  Thanks!\n  Thanks @ogrishman , typo fixed. You can use either `.css.sass` or `.css.scss`\n  I tried the above commands with compass 0.2.17 and bootstrap-sass 3.2.0.0, it works (there are tests for this command as well). In your case, it looks like gem `bootstrap-sass` is not in the Gemfile.\n  This is a great use case for maps. However, this project is an automated conversion from LESS Bootstrap that tries to stay as close to LESS source as possible. It also target sass 3.2, which doesn't have maps.\n  Not sure, but it does require ruby 2.0+\n Perhaps it will work in Git Bash (installed with Git for Windows by default)?\n  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#sass-number-precision\n  Running the tests creates a Compass v0.12.6 project with and compiles it, the URLs are OK:\n\n``` console\n$ cat tmp/new-compass-project/stylesheets/styles.css | grep url\n  src: url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot);\n  src: url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix) format(\"embedded-opentype\"), url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff) format(\"woff\"), url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf) format(\"truetype\"), url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular) format(\"svg\");\n```\n\nWhich Compass version are you using?\n No, I meant that I do not see the error when looking at the output of bootstrap-sass tests (`cat` concatenates and print files, `grep` is a file pattern searcher, `$ man cat` to learn more). \n\nTurns out this is not a version issue though, but [a bug](https://github.com/Compass/compass/issues/1472) in how Compass processes absolute urls. Try  various relative URLs (`css/fonts/bootstrap/`, `fonts/bootstrap/`, `bootstrap/` <- default)\n `bootstrap/` is the default so you don't have to change it at all unless you want to use different glyphicons.\n I have submitted a fix to Compass PR queue https://github.com/Compass/compass/pull/1724\n  The script only works with Bootstrap 3, moreover, it has some version-specific \"patches\" which evolve together with Bootstrap. Bootstrap 2 Sass is available in the corresponding branches, though it is no longer supported.\n  Is `config.assets.digest = true` set to true in `config/environments/production.rb`?\n Indeed, you are supposed to run precompile in production environment. Precompile does not set the environment on its own. This way you can precompile in different environments, e.g. in test to speed up integration tests. Precompiling in development is mostly for debugging.\n\nPrecompile in production or in development but with different settings.\n\nAlso check out [Asset Pipeline Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#precompiling-assets).\n  Unfortunately, the tests are failing. Looks like some environments do not support relative paths like this.\n Thank you for contributing! I have worked around the issue in the commit above. \n  Good call, done!\n  Scaffolding generators would need to be in a separate gem. A search reveals a number of them:\n- https://github.com/decioferreira/bootstrap-generators\n- https://github.com/doabit/bootstrap-sass-extras\n  Is `config.assets.digest = true` in production.rb? Does precompile run in production? \nSince there are no digests even with the URLs overridden, this looks like your environment's configuration issue, not a bootstrap-sass one.\n\nBy the way, Rails precompiles all non-CSS/JS assets by default already, so that line in application.rb is not necessary.\n Rails appends digests (hashes) if and only if `config.assets.digest` is true. It is **true** by default in production, and **false** everywhere else.\n > `Sass::SyntaxError: Undefined variable: \"$alert-padding\".`\n\nThis could be because of a `//= require` instead of `@import` somewhere in Sass. Use `@import` instead so that the variables are shared across the `@import`ed files.\n @rebelwarrior If you do a precompile in development, `config.assets.digest` will be false if you've only set it to true in production. Either way, you need to make sure `config.assets.digest = true` in the environment you are running precompile in.\n  Import grid modules in this order:\n\nGrid framework mixins (columns):\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap/mixins/grid-framework\";\n```\n\nGrid mixins (rows, columns for default screens):\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap/mixins/grid\";\n```\n\nGrid classes (.row, .container, media queries):\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap/grid\";\n```\n\nThe last 2 modules also need [screen size and grid variables](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L263-L334) set to be imported.\n I am here to help with things not documented :ok_hand: Yes, the javascripts are independent of each other, except popover which needs tooltip.\n  Resolved in the commit above\n  Please make sure `bootstap-sprockets` is included _before_ `bootstrap`, and that the precompile task runs in an environment which has:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.assets.digest = true\n```\n\n@petergoldstein Do you also use Rails 4.1.2?\n @shedd Yes, it's new for the version, please see the [release notes](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Readme. \n\nThe code has to work when there is no Sprockets. I do not know a reasonably reliable way to check whether it's being compiled within Sprockets using pure Sass, otherwise we could perhaps even import the file automatically.\n Yes, I should've added a post install note (totally escaped my mind that they exist). Will add one for the next release.\n Try:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n  Please try adding `gem 'sass'` to the Gemfile.\n Looks like one of the gems is defining (re-opening) `Sass` without requiring it. I am not sure which one, but I removed a check for `defined?(::Sass)` in the commit above, does `master` work for you now?\n This is fixed and will work with Rails 3 in the next release (soon).\n\nFor now use:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', \n  git: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass', \n  ref: '540ad23430b1bdb2c72591daf61507ec9e38e468'\n```\n Released v3.2.0.1 with this fixed\n  Would like to see `application.sass`\n Looks like you are using Sprockets with middleman. Please `@import bootstrap-sprockets` before bootstrap. See [release notes](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Readme.\n\n@tdreyno Ruby gem no longer defines any Sass functions, it only ensures `Sass.load_path` and precision are correct. \n  Compass workflow has been improved in v3.2.0\n  Thank you!\n  It will be provided in the next version (see branch next). Turns out lots of people use no asset pipeline for JS.\n  Hmm, changed them a bit here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/2dc2274848029a38302871ba95c442e46b5cb176. Works?\n  Is your Sass version >= 3.2? I think this might not be deprecated anymore.\n There is a global variable `$list` somewhere else in Sass. It is being overwritten because a bootstrap-sass mixin defines a local variable with the same name and is then included into root. When this happens, the [current but deprecated](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html#backwards_incompatibilities__must_read) Sass behaviour is to set the global `$list` to the value of the mixin's local `$list`. This is what is being worked around in the commit above.\n\nUntil the next version is out, you can change the global `$list` to something else and the warning will disappear.\n  Do you have [precision](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#number-precision) set to >8?\n  v3.1.1.1+2 also includes updates from master. There are comments for each release here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases\n It is incorrect, but that's what's there indeed. I did it back then because it looked like only bugfixes (and it's more work to do it the other way). Of course, now it causes compatibility issues :(\n\n@jrochkind Despite 3.1.1+2 not corresponding to any official bootstrap release, I would still target it as that's what is installed most. We will avoid this discrepancy in future.\n Please target v3.2.0 which has just been released.\n  Looks like an older version of Bower that doesn't work with +tags. You can update Bower or update bootstrap-sass to v3.2.0.\n  v.3.1.1+x were ahead of upstream 3.1.1 by a few commits. v3.2.0 is now out and this will not happen again in the future.\n  This is not expanded by default because it makes updating more difficult. This is an expert option, defaults are beginner-friendly. \n  You should not mix require and @import. Files imported with `require` are concatenated post-compilation and will not see any variable overrides etc. Use just @import, should help. \n  v3.1.1+x releases are a few commits ahead of 3.1.1 proper. This will not happen in the future. v3.2.0 is now out which shouldn't have this problem.\n  Hi @jgueytat, perhaps you could find out which CSS rule turns out different? I am very short on time at the moment and this would help fix the issue sooner\n bootstrap-sass 3.1.1+N versions do not match the 3.1.1 release (they are a few commits ahead). This will not happen in future. Is it also different from `v3.1.1`?\n v.3.1.1+x were ahead of upstream 3.1.1 by a few commits. v3.2.0 is now out and this will not happen again in the future.\n  Platform-specific code (i.e. asset path helpers) has been reduced greatly in v3.2.0. What I did was replace all Ruby implementation of asset path helpers with platform-specific Sass files. These files are tiny, so there is only a few hundred bytes of overhead. There is still a matter of no adopted standard for Number precisions configuration, but altogether I don't think it warrants the overhead of maintaining separate repositories for the time being.\n  I am not sure if your setup allows for this, but perhaps you could leverage [bower.json main](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/bower.json#L18-L29) section. Note that the order is important for these files (specifically, tooltip must come before popover).\n  @synthdnb Thank you! \n  @fubarhouse As the other have pointed out, this repo only converts the upstream code (automatically). This will be here once it is merged upstream (and not before).\n  Fixed in v3.2.0\n  @gpakosz Thanks for looking into this\n  #614 is now merged\n  I'll work on a pure Sass integration for Sprockets\\* a la [bootstrap-compass.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap-compass.scss)\n Merged for now, will most likely be replaced with pure Sass integration in the next release.\n  thanks @owyongsk !\n  Not caring about Windows <=> over 9,000 issues from Windows users the day we release this. Will look into moving the files for 3.2, without symlinks.\n  @nschonni Thanks!\n  See #575\n @shama I've registered on npmjs.org as glebm. Thanks!\n It worked as far as I can tell: https://www.npmjs.org/package/bootstrap-sass\n  Great as is, thank you!\n  See also: https://github.com/jlong/sass-bootstrap-defunct/issues/143\n  Please see https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#number-precision\n  @gpakosz  Looking good, PR welcome! \nEventually, we can deprecate the ruby extensions for all environments, and provide integration files like this one instead. \n I have added Sass definitions for Compass and Sprockets to the repo. We will make it default for the next version, and deprecate / remove the ruby code.\n  You can use `gem 'bootstrap-sass'` which requires [sprockets integration](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb) automatically, instead of the bower package. It works with middleman out of the box because middleman uses Sprockets asset pipeline (same one used in Rails).\n @clyfe The correct file name to import is `@import \"bootstrap-sass\"`.\n@cbankester When using without ruby, you will also need to `@import \"bootstrap-compass\"` (available since https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/509a2e682ef9f332a37065c302cddf21646cd7a8) before `bootstrap-sass`.\n @clyfe There is an experimental pure-Sass Sprockets integration on master, which should make it possible to use bootstrap-sass with Middleman / Rails and Bower without using the gem\n\nCould you try it and let us know if it works? Thanks\n\n``` sass\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"\n@import \"bootstrap\"\n```\n @ACPK @carlosantoniodasilva You can try setting `$icon-font-path: \"bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/\"` before importing bootstrap-sass.\n @roalcantara Do not `//= require` inside Sass, use `@import` instead. Sprockets `require` concatenates after the files have been compiled, and the files do not share a context, meaning the file imported will not see `$icon-font-path`. \n Perhaps it will work with a relative path?\n The basic issue is that bootstap-sass-official/vendor is not in [Sass.load_paths](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass.html#load_paths-class_method). You can add it there and the problem should go away. However, if it just works with a relative path instead (../..), we can modify the code here. \n By the way, unfortunately, our tests don't fail even if I set `depend_on` value to mumbo-jumbo. Looks like `precompile` (used in bootstrap-sass rails test) does not check this directive at all.\n Unfortunately, this would only work with Sprockets / Mincer. There is no universal way to set Bower's `main` yet\n I've changed `//= require` paths to relative in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/2dc2274848029a38302871ba95c442e46b5cb176\n I've made changes so it should work now. The file [_bootstrap-sprockets.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap-sprockets.scss) as you suggest already exists, but has not been reported working yet.\n It should be `depend_on`, as there is [an open issue](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/issues/557) with `depend_on_asset`.\n\nFrom Sprockets documentation:\n\n`depend_on` allows you to state a dependency on a file without including it.\n\nThis is used for caching purposes. Any changes made to the dependency file with invalidate the cache of the source file.\n\n---\n\n`depend_on_asset` allows you to state an asset dependency without including it.\n\nThis is used for caching purposes. Any changes that would invalidate the dependency asset will invalidate the source file. Unlike `depend_on`, this will include recursively include the target asset's dependencies.\n Released in v3.2.0\n  > in glyphicons.scss breaks sprockets as the //= means require\n\n`//= depend_on_asset` is just a hint to the caching layer, not the same as `//= require`.\n\nI do not know of a way to pass a sass variable into an Sprockets directive (`//=`). Why do you want to this by the way?\n\nAs a workaround, you can import individual components explicitly (see [Readme](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#sass)), and use your own custom `_glyphicons.sass`.\n\nPerhaps in future Glyphicons definitions should be in 2 files to make this sort of override easier and smaller, e.g. `_glyphicons_font_face.scss` and `_glyphicons_icons.scss` (this would need happen upstream first).\n @rebelwarrior `@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"` before importing bootstrap, please see release notes.\n  Please update to bootstrap-sass v3.2.0.\n Did you `@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"` before `@import \"bootstrap\"`?\n  Which Rails?\n If you are using Rails 3.2.x, please see the updated notes in Readme\n  Dependency issue with test-unit and jruby 1.7.9. Does not fail for me locally on 1.7.11, but added explicit dependency for travis (which runs 1.7.9) and it's green now. Only done for jruby: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/936883c77802e283e622546331bafd03b348342c (otherwise breaks on MRI 2.1.1, weird).\n  [bower spec](https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec#main) does not mention that this can be a directory. Does this work with all the build tools? See also #585.\n @ayan4m1 Thank you for the explanation. I much prefer the directory solution to a giant list of files, as long as it works almost everywhere. If it does, Bower spec should be fixed. I am not a node guy, so not sure what other build tools are in use out there.\n\n@twbs/team @mahnunchik @sindresorhus Does this look good to you? My `main` concern is that directory value is not specified in: https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec#main\n Just realized that there is a partial order for JS, so it cannot be required like this. To be continued in #585.\n @silvenon When used with Rails as a gem, neither `_bootstrap-mincer.scss` ([mincer](https://github.com/nodeca/mincer) integratrion) nor `bower.json` are relevant\n @silvenon The order of the scss files in `main` does not matter, as the order is dealt with using sass `@import` directives within [bootstrap.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss). bootstrap-mincer is not imported by default\n @silvenon Does wiredep import all the scss files from `main`? How does wiredep deal with these [two](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss) [files](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss) in the list? \n Found [this comment](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp/issues/85#issuecomment-40905269) by @stephenplusplus, it clears things up a bit.\n\nIt appears there are two conflicting approaches to importing Sass in Bower-land.\n1. All asset files are expected in main, imports are configured ([grunt-bower-task](https://github.com/curist/grunt-bower), [grunt-bower](https://github.com/yatskevich/grunt-bower-task)). \n2. All the asset files found in main are `imported` by default, exceptions / overrides are configured. The entire bower package is searched in by default, so partials etc do not need to be included, only the main entry points ([wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep))\n\nBower does not specify how `main` should work for a prepocessor at all. I am not sure if either approach is \"better\", perhaps it would great if one was blessed by Bower?\n\nMy gut feel is that `main` is not a place to list \"all the asset (public) files\" as per no. 1, and prefer 2. Because the first approach requires a lot more maintenance to do right, we'll probably want to switch over.\n\n@silvenon Versions for bower are a mess, still working thing out.\n Pushed v3.1.1+2 with only `bootstrap.scss` in main. I like no. 2 better and it's less maintenance, while both have same drawbacks of not working for some folks by default\n/cc @stephenplusplus @silvenon\n I am not even sure if the second approach (v3.1.1.1+2) works for wiredep out of the box, let me know tmw @silvenon We can release another one if not :tophat: \n  Thanks for raising the issue. Resolved by the commit above. For the compiled version it's best to use the bootstrap repo itself, so I went against bower spec recommendation and specified Sass files in there; JS in separate files for modularity.\n  There is already a pending request in the giant bower renaming ticket\n  This can only be built on Windows? ~~It uses a different version format?~~ I won't merge this as I cannot even test it\n @nschonni I am all for supporting another package manager, so if we can build this with Mono, this can be merged. However, as it is now, I don't think I can run it because no PowerShell even with Mono?\n @jamez14 I started reading about Mono, Nuget, [Pash](https://github.com/Pash-Project/Pash), and looks for now Windows is the way to build this. In light of this, a separate repo with a Nuget build script would be best. Perhaps then it can be made official too. /cc @twbs/team  \n @jamez14 Go for it :+1: \n Didn't know about Outercurve, would be great.\n  Which versions of Compass, Sass, and bootstrap-sass are you using? Please try upgrading.\n @betam4x Have you imported `bootstrap-sprockets`? The default font path has changed but only when the asset helpers are not imported. [When on Rails](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#a-ruby-on-rails), in app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n My bad, keep forgetting to include a post-install note. This is required since v3.2.0, and started breaking in development since 3.2.0.1 (better than in production, which is what would happen with 3.2.0 if you didn't include it). \n  @MichaelSp Please refer to the Readme. You should use `gem 'bootstrap-sass'`\n Please upgrade to Compass 0.2.17. Also import bootstrap-compass before bootstrap. Reopen if this doesn't help.\n  Hi, which version are using? Are you using autoprefixer? It can be removing prefixes depending on the config\n  @hico-horiuchi This [was fixed](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/8bc2fca792176dcc5175f0e37eacd4832a4082e0), and will be in 3.1.2. Please use master for now.\n\n@zezantam rails_admin is using bootstrap-sass 2, which does not have these directives. Bootstrap 2 is no longer supported, but the fix would be the same.\n @johnbaldwin The usual thing to do is:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', git: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass'\n```\n\nUsing an `https` URL helps avoid issues with closed ports on tightly secured production systems.\n @corysimmons To make life easier, bootstrap-sass releases are in sync with [twbs/bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). You can easily use master, or even a specific commit using `ref` argument.\n @DanielKehoe Oops, I missed the release of Rails 4.1.0, thanks for calling out. I'll release 3.1.1.1 shortly (with the latest updates from upstream).\n [v3.1.1.1](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/releases/tag/v3.1.1%2B1) is out!. If this breaks for Rails 3.2 due to the changes to mixin structure from upstream, the Readme or gemspec will need to be updated to point to sprockets backport gems. \n\nIIRC there was a problem with the old sprockets gem, which defines a custom Sass importer that does not add the current file's directory to the load path. I do not know if this is still a problem. \n\nThe workaround for this here would be messy (and involve exploding a tree of imports into a giant flat list), so the backport looks like a better solution. The official backport fixes this and many other bugs:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'sprockets-rails', '=2.0.0.backport1'\ngem 'sprockets', '=2.2.2.backport2'\n```\n\n:loudspeaker: Looks like Rails 3.2 is [no longer maintained for bugfixes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/maintenance_policy.html).\n  Thanks!\n  Thanks!\n Now we are, thanks :)\n  Thanks!\n The path is actually [correct](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/tree/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss)\n  Hi, does it work with `bower install boootstrap-sass-official`?\n Nice, docs updated\n  @djanowski Sure, PR welcome. \n @akshatpradhan Node.js apps are served very well by https://github.com/andrew/node-sass\n  Perhaps passing `{sprockets: {context: context}}` options will help, as this is what Sprockets does and what bootstrap-sass [expects](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb#L41)\n As we no longer use functions defined in ruby, this may even work as is with 3.2.0. Please reopen if this is still a problem and if my suggestion does not help. \n  Setting `$bootstrap-sass-asset-helper: false` might help if autoprefixing comes from the platform-native asset helper.\n  Thanks! \n  PR welcome\n Added all the other files with https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/328973b548f466e2106972fe910ce67d75de63cf\n  There is lots of competing asset compilers in node (wiredep, mincer, etc). Bootstrap works well with these, but needs some tool-specific configuration (font load paths, number precision, as described in Readme).\n  Best PR ever. Build fails for an [unrelated reason](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/issues/191), so merged!\n  I've added tests for the latest versions and they [do fail](https://travis-ci.org/twbs/bootstrap-sass/builds/20719969). \n\nThis is not an issue with bootstrap-sass, the issue linked above by @qpowell (thanks!) provides a solution for now:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'sprockets', '=2.11.0'\n```\n @Stajor The cache issue is an Sprockets issue in progress https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/issues/507.\n  In Rails 3.2 the assets group is not loaded in production by default, meaning it won't be loaded by default during `rake assets:precompile` in a production. For the assets to precompile, the gem must be required (as it defines bootstrap-sass asset path helpers). `assets` group no longer exists in rails 4. I have updated the Readme.\n  Are you writing a gem? What is in gem.gemspec?\n  Thanks, fixed in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/df7be4f0412497e22f1d271d94d6e9835f61113e\n  They are the same in master but not in v3.1.1: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/v3.1.1/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_modals.scss#L102. The `1` in v3.1.1 is unitless which causes this issue. You can use master for now:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', git: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass'\n```\n @plentz The actual code for this projects comes from the Less version. This projects just handles the (automated) conversion from Less to Sass. The problem is that `1` is unitless, if it was `1px` this would just fine.\n @mdo Yes, this is not a problem on master, only on `v3.1.1`\n@plentz We do automated conversion of the upstream, please post style issues on [the upstream tracker](/twbs/bootstrap/issues)\n  @mahnunchik Awesome solution, thank you! :8ball:  So beautiful.\nNow that node-sass 0.8.3 is out, rebuilding is no longer necessary. This recipe could be provided with bootstrap-sass, for ease of integration. Would you like to submit a pull request? The file could be placed in `vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_bootstrap-mincer.css.ejs.scss`\n\n``` sass\n@import \"bootstrap-mincer\"\n@import \"bootstrap\"\n```\n Thanks, this has now been integrated and documented! Great work! :ship: \n  There are 2 other reasons this started off and stayed Scss:\n- It is way easier to convert from LESS, which has braces, to Scss\n- libsass and other tools may not support Sass yet\n\nI don't like braces and write all my code in Sass. Luckily, Bootstrap source being Scss does not prevent one from doing so.\n  The order is different, but as far as I can see from the inspector this is not affecting the styles.\npyScss looks great! Is there anything we should add to the Readme for it?\n Closing, as this is no longer an issue in 3.2.0 as far as I can tell.\n  Please install the latest Ruby with http://rubyinstaller.org/\n  Thanks! Would you like to submit a pull request?\n @renier This looks fine. A few things to look out for:\n-  `application.css` should be `application.css.sass` or `.css.scss`. \n- `$alert_padding` - we are not using a variable like this, there is `$alert-padding` [though](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L597)\n\n> Additionally, I copied over the bootstrap-sass assets\n\nYou shouldn't copy the assets, just use the gem.\n  bootstrap-sass requires a newer version of libsass than the one bundled with the current node-sass release. See https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/494#issuecomment-33439307\n  While the Readme is still environment-specific, the structure has been improved with more generic sections and it should be easier to integrate with frameworks like Play now (v3.2.0). Default Compass setup also copies JS and font into the project by default. \n  It's like this because we couldn't make it work reliably with Rails 3 any other way\n We can change this in v4, as we will no longer support Rails 3 by then\n @marcovtwout\n\n> What is the current reason for doing this differently?\n- For a compiled version (`dist`) you should just use twbs/bootstrap: there is nothing to gain from using this repository apart from the potential compatibility issues. \n- Assets are scoped under `assets` for clear separation between the client-side assets and the rest. Non top-level Sass imports are scoped under `bootstrap/` to avoid name clashes with your own Sass files (e.g. _forms.scss) on import. Non-Sass assets are scoped the same way for consistency. \n- `docs` are not included yet. If we generate Sass snippets along with LESS for http://getbootstrap.com, perhaps then we will copy docs here as well. \n  [This file](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb) has to be `require`d for font paths to resolve on precompilation. It may be that moving the gem out of `:assets` is enough, and `initialize_on_precompile` is not necessary.\n\nOn Rails 4 `initialize_on_precompile` is `true` by default. On heroku enable [user-env-compile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/labs-user-env-compile) for `initialize_on_precompile=true` to work. \n Thanks, @betesh. `require 'bootstrap-sass'` has to happen, but looks like it happens even with `initialize_on_precompile = false`.\n`initialize_on_precompile = true` is probably not unnecessary but first I want to verify what is happening in #533.\n It really does seem unnecessary (as require happens anyway by default), now removed.\n Because Rails 3.x this group is only required in development or test, so gems in this group will not be required on production asset precompilation (`RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile`).\n\nThe relevant line from Rails 3.2 is [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/config/application.rb#L17):\n\n``` ruby\nBundler.require(*Rails.groups(:assets => %w(development test)))\n```\n  Please provide more information: rails, sass-rails, sprockets versions, asset pipeline settings, and how you import bootstrap-sass. Thanks.\n @cyrusstoller Please try with `config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = true`, does it work?\n https://github.com/cyrusstoller/RevTilt/blob/1e965473e8ebd7cef4987f4e80d5c3f03888c69d/config/application.rb#L63. On heroku you will need [user-env-compile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/labs-user-env-compile) enabled too.\n @cyrusstoller The setting might help or not make any difference. It might help since this works in development. Do you remember what the urls looked like with 3.1.1 on production? I'll see if I can reproduce it with your app tomorrow.\n @cyrusstoller I have not been able to reproduce the problem with RevTilt, the only change I made from master is bootstrap-sass version:\n\n``` bash\n~/RevTilt - [master\u25cf] \u00bb cat Gemfile.lock | grep bootstrap-sass\n    bootstrap-sass (3.1.1.0)\n  bootstrap-sass (~> 3.1.1.0)\n~/RevTilt - [master\u25cf] \u00bb RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.258192 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/PuzzleHalf-e93aebafd14e9370e2795fd3f49f0a97.png\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.260059 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/PuzzleOff-cd57ee67bc4f737ad3ecd5f704e2de7f.png\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.261407 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/PuzzleOn-26fb5265704686bb9e3e00c04318af8d.png\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.262692 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/favicon-d048f2f6c866cdb9310f74ef910aefc4.png\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.264538 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/logo-82228efd769a8ec8814c02c337a03997.png\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.283759 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/application-a3f05aad636b519dc43d5ac36d8d25b2.js\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.306897 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/application-5454a30eaff7a3dc94c6198ff35b1ffd.css\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.313666 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-9424bcf8f49d772c152e0b760b39b8f9.eot\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.315710 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-ab814146cdfc4d37cc90765f7bf86107.svg\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.318348 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-7531c2bd6e03c07cc2d83fa38e1e2218.ttf\nI, [2014-02-23T05:37:14.321015 #55633]  INFO -- : Writing /Users/glebm/RevTilt/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-fcc658a3dec1be1cb0a9bb81f4c7c6de.woff\n~/RevTilt - [master\u25cf] \u00bb cat public/assets/application-*.css | ack -o 'url\\(.*?glyphicons-.*?[,;}]'\nurl(\"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-9424bcf8f49d772c152e0b760b39b8f9.eot\");\nurl(\"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-9424bcf8f49d772c152e0b760b39b8f9.eot?#iefix\") format(\"embedded-opentype\"),\nurl(\"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-fcc658a3dec1be1cb0a9bb81f4c7c6de.woff\") format(\"woff\"),\nurl(\"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-7531c2bd6e03c07cc2d83fa38e1e2218.ttf\") format(\"truetype\"),\nurl(\"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-ab814146cdfc4d37cc90765f7bf86107.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular\") format(\"svg\")}\n```\n @cyrusstoller Please try bumping [`config.assets.version`](https://github.com/cyrusstoller/RevTilt/blob/master/config/environments/production.rb#L36). Perhaps this is some weird Rails manifest caching issue.\n\n@ruckc @jdinse Do you have `config.assets.digest = true` in `config/environments/production.rb`?\n\n@ruckc  `rake assets:precompile` by itself won't work the same way as `RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile`, because asset compilation settings are differ from env to env. Run the latter to see what it precompiles to in production.\n\n@jdinse `_` in ruby automatically become `-` in Sass\n @jdinse Are you running the command with `RAILS_ENV=production`?\n @jdinse Please post your Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, config/environments/production.rb, and application.css.sass. Also, what does the full `url(..)` look like in the compiled version?\n @betesh This was most likely caused by the lack of `// depend_on_asset ...` declarations. These are there now, so the cache should expire automatically.\n  You shouldn't need this, it's already set everywhere https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_scaffolding.scss#L11-L17\n  Please submit style issues [upstream](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues)\n  The function is here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb\n These guys are doing it with node and compass: https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular/tree/master/templates/common\n See also implementation and comment in [_variables.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L1-L4).\n  Importing the variables alone should do the trick, no need for `mixins`.\n  With bundler\n\n``` bash\ncat Gemfile.lock | grep bootstrap-sass\n```\n\nGem version, but without bundler: \n\n``` bash\nruby -rbootstrap-sass/version -e 'puts Bootstrap::VERSION'\n```\n  Look in the `head` section of the application layout for a `meta` tag referencing it. Not related to bootstrap.\n  @mdo I've added a tag for `v3.1.0+2`, v3.1.0 already points to 3.1.0.1 ruby release. Thanks!\nNote that `-` is semver for pre-release (won't show in bower), while `+` is for metadata.\n @nschonni This would cause problems when 3.1.1 is released upstream :)\n  Assets group no longer exists in rails 4, please make the notice specific to rails 3\n Added Rails 3 notice https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/0f37b4d4ffb3bb50551489aa8763fc5a548e59ea\n  This should still resolve correctly. Can you post your Gemfile? Looks like you might be missing sass-rails or be locked to a very old version of one of the gems.\n The versions look fine, so something else must be wrong (other gems like sprockets-rails? config?). See [@nex3's comment on `@import` behaviour](https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/652#issuecomment-13979922).\n Try setting it to true:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.assets.initialize_on_precompile = true\n```\n > I'm able to replicate the problem on a fresh installation of rails 3.2.16 with only bootstrap-sass as the additional gem.\n\nPlease push this to github\n Please do not use `require` directives within Sass files as it messes with Sass path resolution. Just let `@import` handle it.\n\nSee https://github.com/glebm/ab/commit/482c141a8a0ae1c9fc95c1445095b0ecd9021149, and also rename the file to application.css.sass\n ~~Try the following gem versions (backports to Rails 3):~~\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'sprockets-rails', '=2.0.0.backport1'\ngem 'sprockets', '= 2.2.2.backport2'\n```\n\n~~Seems to work with the sample app. Updated docs https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/0f37b4d4ffb3bb50551489aa8763fc5a548e59ea~~\n Nvm, doesn't work. Btw, unrelated but it's better to set precompile in `application.rb` rather than `production.rb` so you can run precompile in other environments. \n At last, [a workaround](https://github.com/glebm/ab/commit/a99bfa9835a0ad055577ffe43341ffcf652c6f48) with backports of Rails 4 pipeline fixes:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'sprockets-rails', '~> 2.0.0.backport1'\ngem 'sprockets', '~> 2.2.2.backport2'\ngem 'sass-rails', github: 'guilleiguaran/sass-rails', branch: 'backport'\n```\n\nAs a bonus you get Rails 4 speed deployments .\n I changed @import to use paths relative to the file in order to avoid relying on modified Sass load path, since the file directory is [always present in @import path](https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/652#issuecomment-13979922). This is mainly for non-ruby users (e.g. node-sass), as ruby users always get the load path on `require 'bootstrap-sass'`.\n\nThis does work out of the box in Rails 4, but, unfortunately, there is a bug in the older versions of the gems that has only been fixed in the backports. Meanwhile, I've added a note on this to Readme.\n Released 3.1.0.2 with the simpler fix above (does not require upgraded pipeline).\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.1.0.2'\n```\n  Please raise design issues in the [LESS repository](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass). This port is a 1-1 automatic conversion.\n  Tried and it works on the latest Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0.0 installed via http://rubyinstaller.org/. Needs more information to reproduce.\n  Removing quotes makes your shell treat the version number as a comment\n It is in e.g. zsh by default. Currently asking about `\"\"` in the issue\n Turns out the number was only necessary because Bower does not support 4-digit version tags (invalid semver). We use 3-digit tags since v3.1.0. I've [updated](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/a1d13d02e9489b17968b3bffb8ef0c3ba5678161) the readme.\n Another package had taken the name before bootstrap-sass was made official. There is a pending [renaming request in the ever-expanding Bower issue](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#issuecomment-31174875). Not sure if funny or sad.\n  What is your shell? Does it work with double quotes?\nThe problem with removing quotes completely is that many shells will treat `#` as the beginning of a comment (e.g. zsh by default) /cc @nschonni\n Since we are now following SemVer for tags I am going to drop the version number from the Readme (bower will pick up the latest tag automatically)\n  This should be OK now on master:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', git: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass'\n```\n Fix released in v3.1.0.1\n  @thomas-mcdonald Yep, same as the other one. \n@avromao Did you upgrade to 3.1 or find another fix? I looked into it but they are present for me `v3.0.3*` tags.\n @avromao v3.1 does not have them because it doesn't need them! \n Fiddle also broken on twbs/bootstrap (.visible-xs.visible-sm do not work together), this is an upstream issue\nDupe of https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12015\nProposed fix https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/12025\n A possible fix came from upstream https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/2a5d87e24d6837b0e5d7349e04349ba25f468359\n  You can use [this one](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/js/bootstrap.js). Granted, using an asset pipeline such as Sprockets (ruby) or connect-assets (node) is a better idea.\n  These conflicts keep cropping up every other version on so, and not just with Compass. Prefixing all mixins would be nice but if we do this it should probably be done from upstream. @twbs/team Consider `twbs-` mixin prefix for v4?\n @mdo Awesome, thanks!\n  Nice catch, thank you! I had missed the significance of that `&` (not a redundancy but a parent selector). Should be fixed now.\n\nCan't wait for Sass 3.3 which I think supports Less-style `&` anywhere (as `#{&}`). \n Did not mean to close, please do confirm that all is OK now. \nGithub auto-closing issues on using the word \"Fixes\" in the commit message is super annoying.\n You have to use master and not v3.1.0 tag as that hasn't moved yet\n  Which version? Does it work with master?\n JS here is identical to the Less version. Try stopping the server, `rm -rf tmp/cache`, and start it again.\n Upgrade to v3.1.0 (just released).\n  This is done differently in the latest master, and I've just verified the output of v3.0.3.0 tag and they are the same (for these selectors). Are you sure you are looking at the matching versions?\n Upgrade to v3.1.0\n  What is the command you use to start the server? Try prefixing with `bundle exec`\n SO question has been answered by the enquirer\n  @tnguyen14 Good news is, @akhleung just added if URLs support [to libsass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues/231). As for the quotes thing, I've changed them to double quotes to be compatible with both.\n @tnguyen14 No, the tag is fixed, the next version with this stuff will be 3.1.0, just pull master for now\n  A generic converter would need to properly parse LESS into a syntax tree. We are just [running some regexps](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/tasks/converter/less_conversion.rb).\n  If you are using Rails it will just be using `config.asset_host`. The font is not displaying because the right header is not set by the server serving them to cloudfront. If it's Rails, use [font_assets gem](https://github.com/rubymaverick/font_assets). If it's Apache / nginx, set Access-Control-Allow-Origin to \"https://site.where.font.is.requested.from.com\" for font assets.\n  It appears you are using [sass-bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-bootstrap), which isn't this Sass port. Please re-open if the problem happens with this one.\n  Strange that the tests were passing. How do you compile it? \n Nevermind, the tests had not yet not run at that point\n  Looks like all URLs referenced with `#hash` are not being fingerprinted during precompilation.\n Yes, I'll write a test for this to see which combinations of gems are affected by this.\n I've added a test and all the URLs get compiled correctly using the gem versions we test against: https://travis-ci.org/twbs/bootstrap-sass. Please see if the problem remains after updating sass, sass-rails, sprockets, rails, and bootstrap-sass. Can you post Gemfile.lock and production.rb?\n That is another issue related to font assets being denied by CSP. For ruby look into font-assets (if you CDN).\n See also my answer to #504 \n @aug-riedinger Yeah you need to specify the right headers. See [this](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/504#issuecomment-32734325)\n  Thanks!\n  The issue is that Sass does not support `@extend` inside media queries, and should be addressed by Sass. See also #495 \n The other issue actually talks about making every class a mixin. \n\nAt the moment Sass developers [<q>feel the output of this would be unexpected by many users</q>](https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/984). My experience has been quite the opposite. \n\nHopefully this will change. See also nex3/sass#1050\n @jrochkind by the way, ~~https://github.com/wilsonpage/sass-import-once~~\n The right link is: https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/blob/master/import-once/README.md\n Not that it helps with this case.\n  I've added a `composer.json` based on @jlong's version, let me know how it goes.\nPlease note that bootstrap-sass version has an extra number (used to specify sass-version-specific patchlevel), so the current latest stable is either `3.0.3.0` (rubygems convention) or `3.0.3-0` (npm convention). Both are tagged.\n @nschonni Oh, I see. It appears there is no solution short of fixing SemVer itself at the moment. I found the relevant SemVer issue and outlined the problem there: https://github.com/mojombo/semver/issues/168\n @evantishuk I've signed up on Packagist (username: glebm) and updated the homepage URL for composer.json. I think for now we'll peg the version to the one in bootstrap for SemVer package managers. Not sure why it decided to pick up node-sass branch. Daniel Martins is not on @twbs team.\n  - [x] Compilable with libsass (0.3.8)\n- [x] Compilation test \n- [x] docs\n\n~~Blocked by~~\n- ~~https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues/231~~\n- ~~https://github.com/andrew/node-sass/issues/212~~\n Good news, everyone! It finally [compiles](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues/231#issuecomment-33248428) with libsass master, thanks to @akhleung's work on `url` support.\n\nWe would need [a new release](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass/issues/233) of node-sass or sass-ruby to run the tests, so I'll keep this open for now.\n node-sass 0.8.3 is out, it compiles bootstrap-sass master out of the box. @mahnunchik posted a guide for node-sass using mincer [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/551).\n  theme defines some mixins, I don't think you'll be able to use them unless it's a partial, am I right?\n Is it causing any problems? Making it a non-partial will, for people that do use these mixins.\n  @jmpalacios [bundle](http://bundler.io/). Also, bootstrap-sass is now compatible with libsass master, so you should be able to use node-sass once they release a version with the latest binaries.\n @jmpalacios It's like bower for ruby packages (called rubygems). In fact, bower's design is heavily based on bundler. You will be able to forego compass / ruby completely. As node ecosystem is heavily fragmented, a full solution will depend on what asset manager you use: I hear good things about [connect-assets](https://github.com/adunkman/connect-assets). \n I assume you mean `dist` and not `less`. If you want plain CSS, just use `dist` from twbs/bootstrap or the LESS generator - the result is CSS anyway.\n See also `bundle exec` [explained on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6588708/181228).\n  Just tried this and it works for me. Which version are you trying this on? Please post the markup you are using (for the whole `table`).\n  Does this break on master as well?\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', git: 'https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass'\n```\n This is likely an [upstream](/twbs/bootstrap) issue. Please check with upstream CSS and submit the issue there.\n  One idea would be to provide a language switcher for the code snippets (LESS, Sass, Scss, CSS, CoffeeScript ?). I've outlined the idea in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/447, now this could be done as part of twbs/bootstrap build process.\n Perhaps we could link from the CSS page to this repo for now? Something like:\n\n> ## Using Sass\n> \n> Bootstrap provides an official Sass port. Please head over to [bootstrap-sass](/twbs/bootstrap-sass) to learn about using bootstrap with Sass.\n Now bits of LESS can be converted by themselves (integration point for docs):\n\n``` bash\n$ echo '.p { #gradient > .horizontal(red,blue) }' | rake less_to_scss[810c7ec4f8004129b88eba4aee15475d5d6f79ba]\n.p { @include gradient-horizontal(red,blue) }\n```\n  This is a work in progress PR for bower support branch. \n Would be interesting to see if this can work with node-sass / connect-assets. https://github.com/adunkman/connect-assets/tree/v3\n @twbs/team  Let's make bootstrap-sass available on bower! \nI don't know much node but hopefully someone on the team does. This should compile on node-sass (need test).  Would be nice for if it to be compatible with JS sprockets alternatives like [connect-assets](https://github.com/adunkman/connect-assets/tree/v3).\n Many thanks for the feedback, it appears you are indeed the first one to try :+1:  Does the commit above fix this one?\n You need to specify the commit hash for now (this is not on master branch):\n\n`bower install  'git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#1ab5022'`\n Apologies, it should be:\n\n```\nbower install 'git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#bower'\n```\n I am hoping to get `bootstrap-sass` for this repo (there is a thread on renaming in the bower tracker)\n  The URL is resolved [here](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb#L16).\n\nCheck that:\n- in Gemfile: `sass-rails` is present, nothing is in the `assets` group\n- `config.assets.initialize_on_precompile` is **not** set to `false`\n- assets are compiled on deploy with `RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile ...`.\n See also: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/issues/443\n  You generally shouldn't need to run `assets:precompile` in development (if you do, then you are likely doing it wrong). Nevertheless, the setting you would want to enable is `config.assets.digest = true` in development.rb\n\nhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#in-production\n On a second read, this is something else, since the files do get MD5.\nPlease make sure sprockets and sass-rails are the latest version.\n Check for where you might be setting `config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false` as that might make it fall back to non-sprockets assets resolution (I'm guessing you might have set it to false when reading about Rails 3.x on heroku docs). \n\nSet it back to the default **`true`**\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.assets.initialize_on_precompile = true \n```\n\nThen enable `user-env-compile` for the app on heroku:\n\n``` bash\n# Enable precompile support for the app\nheroku labs:enable user-env-compile\n# Remove precompiled assets\nrm -rf public/assets/\ngit add -u \ngit commit -m 'Remove precompiled assets'\n# Now push and everything should just work from now on\ngit push heroku master\n```\n  It takes about 15s on my Mac Book Air 2013 (i5, SSD)\n  The exact commit hash of upstream can be found in [version.rb](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/version.rb). See the documentation as pointed out above for more information.\n\n``` ruby\nBootstrap::BOOTSTRAP_SHA\n```\n  As you point out, the file is 41KB in this repository, so the problem is not with bootstrap-sass.\n  Hi @mdo! I think this is finally (almost?) ready to move. ~~Hopefully @github can help us move the issues~~ I see you have a Github Staff badge :)\n Now is a good time as we have no open bugs :shipit: \n :tada: \n  What is your environment?\n This appears to be a feature / bug of compass: https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/blob/stable/lib/compass/sass_extensions/functions/urls.rb#L52-L55\n\nWhen using compass do not add a leading `/`.\n @golightly This is how compass font resolution works. There is also a `fonts_dir` compass config variable. What path do you want?\n Compass has a bug when processing absolute urls. When using with Compass just set `$icon-font-path: \"bootstrap/\";` (the default)\nRelated: https://github.com/Compass/compass/issues/1472\n  If you really want to use 3 there is also https://github.com/wtfiwtz/simple_form_bootstrap3\n  Looks like it is \\e109 in 3.0.3.0 https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_glyphicons.scss#L148\n @samir-85 I am referring to the calendar icon having the correct character code (\\e109) in the current source.\nTry `rm -rf tmp/cache` + restart the server.\n  See also this comment on how to switch from local to `user-env-compile` https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/486#issuecomment-30810311\n @ajeeshpu Great writeup, thank you! I believe this can be closed now.\n  Changing the versioning format is not really an option (need both upstream version and ours; rubygems doesn't support `+` version metadata; there are tens thousands of users with `~>` locked dependencies). What's the second best fix?\n @jasonschock Bower support is important, we can mention `bower install '<git-url>#<git-tag-or-sha>'` in the readme and set the version in bower.json. This package is going to move to twbs/boostrap-sass (_ed tom_) soon, that's when we can change the bower registry.\n This issue depends on #481\n @jasonschock @AlJohri @jrobeson Could you guys look at #488 and comment if it's OK\n It appears there is no solution to compatible version numbers short of fixing SemVer itself. I found the relevant SemVer issue and outlined the problem there: https://github.com/mojombo/semver/issues/168\n We have switched to `v3.1.0` scheme for all non-rubygems versions as of now!\n  You appear to be reading the docs for Bootstrap 2, while using 3.\nDocs for 3: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid\n  This belongs in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap\n  Gradients were not removed but moved to bootstrap/theme. This is 3.0.0 at the moment.\n  Does this happen with 3.0.1.0.rc or 3.0.0.0? If it does, please check your markup, and if that doesn't help please open an issue in twbs/bootstrap tracker.\n\nMake sure you are using the class: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_navbar.scss#L485-L490\n  Are you using version 2? In v2 it was `//= require bootstrap-scrollspy`. To use 3 specify 3.0.0.0.rc2 in Gemfile.\n  Hmm, this adds another file to maintain (= problems in the future). However, we can probably `expand_path` relative to `File.dirname(__FILE__)` to achieve the desired effect. _Update_ hmm no\n Hey, turns out options are passed into ERB, so we now inject the correct path from the manifest\n Compass docs are sparse, there is even a suggestion there to use the mailing list because there it's undocumented, had to dig through the source to find out \n  Documentation on the home page is for bootstrap 3, but you are pointing to version 2 of the gem in the Gemfile.\nYou can use version 3 by pointing to master atm.\n  This is a limitation of the twbs/bootstrap, there is probably an issue raised there already\n  Wrote the comment and then deleted right away realizing this.\nThis looks good. Once sass 3.3.0 comes out this can maybe be done via `call` helper https://github.com/nex3/sass/pull/812.\n  bootstrap-sass can automatically convert all the examples in the twbs/bootstrap docs from LESS to Sass using the converter. sass-convert for Scss to Sass: `sass-convert --from scss --to sass`.\n[js2coffee](https://github.com/rstacruz/js2coffee) for JS to Coffee. Tabs / pills switch in the docs.\n\nExample of converting LESS to Sass:\n\n``` bash\necho '.p { #gradient > .horizontal(red,blue) }' | rake less_to_scss[810c7ec4f8004129b88eba4aee15475d5d6f79ba]\n```\n I originally mentioned it because it is popular in ruby community, largely due to it being the default in Rails 4\n  - _Installation_ sections all moved before the _usage_ section, copy update for all.\n- For compass section, there is also an attempt to improve / fix compass project generation.\n Get better, that's the most important!\n  Could you please run it again? The compass stuff has been updated\n Actually, if you are using Rails you shouldn't have to run `compass create` to use bootstrap-sass.\n Please reopen if still a problem\n  Branch 3.0.0-wip no longer exists. Please see the updated README.md.\n  The hash comes from Rails asset pipeline and the css gets md5 in url() too during `rake assets:precompile` if the relevant setting is enabled (on by default in production).\n Asset pipeline should now work out of the box with Rails and bootstrap-sass v3.0.3.0+.\n  We would need a failing test to fix this. Please reopen when there is one. You can add a Gemfile [here](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/tree/master/test/gemfiles) if this only affects specific versions.\n  If you want the latest twbs/bootstrap (not 3.0 release but master) please try `latest-twbs` branch. The fixes have been going in there as we are waiting for bootstrap-sass gem release with twbs/boostrap 3.0 on bootstrap-sass/master (it is a bit confusing, but should all be resolved soon). \nSomething a lot of people seem to be confused by: the converter is an internal task that is used to convert LESS to SCSS, _not_ something that converts bootstrap 2 to 3.\n\nIf the issue is still present on `latest-twbs` branch please reopen.\n  > v2.3.2 is end of life\n\nPrecisely. Can't maintain both. Sorry.\n  `bootstrap-responsive` isn't a file anymore, since the responsive behaviour is built right into Bootstrap 3.\n  Yeah, I know it's not really working. I only split them up because of the amount of times I've seen (on Stack Overflow etc) people asking about `config.rb` and Compass stuff when they're specifically trying to install for Rails.\n  Could you rebase against the latest changes (now all is in README.md)? Thanks\n  > Is it possible to use Bootstrap 3 in this gem?\n\nYes: `gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.0.0.0.rc2'`\n  Responsive styling was [a part of](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive) Bootstrap 2.3.2, if you [chose to include it](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/tree/v2.3.2.2#responsive-styling).\n oh, whoops. thanks.\n  whoops, made this twice by the looks of it.\n  Looks great, cheers for the work on it. Does it hit the stylesheet URL/verify that that the SCSS compiles correctly through the pipeline?\n Hitting /assets/stylesheets.css and checking the page status doesn't seem to be enough, since it's returning 200 and saving a blank file. hrm.\n Having said all that, I managed to get the app.css.sass file to throw an error and it looks like it does propagate through to the original, so this is actually going to be fine as is.\n I got a test using `get` to work, but it looks like the original test will work fine and cover both js/css.\n  on bootstrap 2, yes. Just don't import `bootstrap-responsive`.\n\nBootstrap 3 I am not sure. I don't think so, although I'm yet to use it in a project. You might have to check the Bootstrap docs.\n  maaan, is it really this complicated?\n  I just pushed some updates to the documentation, thanks\n  Let me know if this works for you. This sets it to [10, value].max, enforcing a minimum.\n Bower support is still experimental, thanks for bringing this up -- Readme updated!\n I've seen this in the wild for `precision`: https://github.com/peerb/generator-angular/blob/fdae59428a77260eb392de643a2ae7786819234c/templates/common/Gruntfile.js#L203\nIt would be great if someone who uses this could do this (I am not a node guy).\n  The !default _allows_ you to override the variables. Define [these](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L152) variables as a Jammit friendly version before importing Bootstrap to override them and (I imagine) fix the issue.\n  We don't have a `bootstrap:install` generator. You need to follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#rails)\n  thanks\n  Hey @glebm. I'm getting an error when I try and run this. It seems to be happening when processing the responsive-visibility mixins, but I didn't look into it much further.\n\n```\nrake aborted!\nundefined method `size' for 40..68:Range\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:368:in `block in insert_sub'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:365:in `each'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:365:in `insert_sub'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:338:in `replace_properties'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:178:in `block in parameterize_mixin_parent_selector'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:295:in `replace_rules'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:176:in `parameterize_mixin_parent_selector'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:44:in `block in process_stylesheet_assets'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:34:in `each'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:34:in `process_stylesheet_assets'\n/Users/peter/Projects/bootstrap/bootstrap-sass/tasks/converter.rb:28:in `process'\n```\n  This has been fixed upstream.\n ?\n  Icons do work now (rc2). Please reopen if still a problem.\n  Why is this a good idea? To exclude a component, why simply not @import?\n This is the default one: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/bootstrap.scss\n No, it is already in your asset search path. Instead of doing `@import 'bootstrap'` you can import the core and only the components you need.\n README updated with instructions\n  closing this as a libsass issue, although it (might?) be fixed there\n  Closing as out of scope.\n  This is packaged as a ruby gem and is ready to use with Rails or Compass. jlong's is packaged with twitter's Bower package manager and would work better with Node, or without a framework.\n  Hi @thomas-mcdonald. I finally got around to removing the `twbs-` prefixing, as well as catching us up with a bunch of new upstream changes. I even tested our output css against the current bootstrap 3 docs and it all looks good from what I can tell. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n Thanks for pointing this out @mumualex. This should all be fixed now with the latest update here: https://github.com/intridea/bootstrap-sass/commit/b40433fb25f5614252d6d80de8905b55ec3ff757#L29L36\n @mumualex I believe there will be some conflicts if you are using compass. Not sure how many. You can try importing compass last if you prefer their mixins, but that might break bootstrap. Haven't tested.\n @trisweb I actually started this effort because the sass-twitter-bootstrap project was not moving along at a very fast pace back when I started. However it looks like they're almost caught up to us now.  Perhaps @jlong would like to port our converter task back to sass-twitter-bootstrap.\n @trisweb Regardless, I think it's still nice to minimize upstream conversion dependencies. Makes for slower releases. But if we do have an upstream conversion, then sass-twitter-bootstrap should really be a compass extension that could be required as a dependency in our gemspec. That would be the cleanest way to do it.\n Thanks @thomas-mcdonald :thumbsup:\n  This is correct... not sure how the paths got removed. Thanks.\n  fixed in 2.3.2.2, which was just pushed. Sorry for the wait/lack of response.\n  Closing as obsolete. Please reopen if still broken with 3.0.0.0.rc2.\n  :shipit:\n  Do we need to loosen the dependency on sass-rails?\n\n---\n\nedit: This isn't a bootstrap-sass bug, we don't have a dependency on `sass-rails ~> 3.2`. Updating `sass-rails` to `4.0.0.rc1` will fix this, though.\n  Looks good to me. The changes with javascript paths will break the Compass template (although I imagine that's only a 1 char fix).\n @glebm, have a commit bit. Thanks for your help and PRs recently.\n  what version of Rails/sass-rails/sprockets/Compass? I'll need to attach pry with those (and, I guess, a load of other versions) to work out what the hell is actually going on here.\n I think getting the sprockets context through `Rails.application` might work, since compass-rails is (possibly) messing with that context. Let me set up a sample project and repro.\n er, well.\n- Same gem versions.\n- `rails new testapp`.\n- rename `application.css` to `application.css.scss`, replace content with `@import \"bootstrap\";`\n\nPrecompiles fine. As does adding a class with an image-path call. `bundle exec compass init --using bootstrap` seems to chuck a load of files in the root of the project, which I assume is not intended (looks to be like a bug.. I'll try with a lower version of Rails)\n\n---\n\nedit: even with Compass putting the files in app/assets, it still seems to compile fine.\n Asset pipelines are so messed up, haha. Thanks all for going through and helping to debug (and fix!). I'm going to try and get this pushed out tonight, then we can finally get the next Bootstrap update out.\n  I think this will be fixed with #365, which pulls in from upstream.\n  @thomas-mcdonald do we not have 2.3.2 yet? Are you guys mostly focused on dev for 3 now? I can take care of this if so.\n @thomas-mcdonald the current master is 2.3.2.... can we please push the gem? Thanks.\n For those of you who want to use 2.3.2 now, you can just use `gem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass'` to get it for now.\n  That doesn't seem to have been merged into upstream yet. Is there a pull request for it?\n  This is fixed in master\n  Closing as obsolete. Please reopen if still broken with 3.0.0.0.rc2.\n  This is wrong, isn't it? If you're importing bootstrap in your application.css.scss file, it will be in the generated application css file, unless something is set up wrong.\n  Thing is, if you're not using Rails, you won't need `compass-rails`. I think the documentation for installing needs to be split out the Readme, and into a `/docs` directory, there's way too many cases to cover in there.\n  The load path not being updated suggests the engine is not being loaded - are you doing something non-default with Rails initialisation/requiring the gem? Personally, I've had no problems on Rails 4.\n The assets group [isn't used](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16406204/why-did-rails4-drop-support-for-assets-group-in-the-gemfile) in Rails 4 any more, and so I assume gems inside that group won't be automatically required on application load.\n  We won't be adding Bootstrap extensions, sorry.\n  Could you squash the commits into one?\n ta, I'll have a look through the changes tomorrow\n @glebm looks [intentional](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/3.0.0-wip/less/mixins.less#L466)\n  Send it over, generally if it compiles fine I'm quite happy if others want to keep the preview updated, I should have a few minutes to check stuff over later anyway.\n  What errors do you get in the console?\n  The demo site looks like an older version of Bootstrap.\n  This request should go to twitter/bootstrap.\n  No, but you could put it in your own `vendor/assets` directory.\n  Yeah, looks great. If you have any more ideas for the Compass file, let me know, it needs some more love!\n  No worries. The 3 branch is mostly a throwaway branch except for changes to the .rb files - we'll be pulling in the updates from another conversion as per usual - so don't worry about the commits too much.\n  ah-ha, magic. We actually need this in both branches since we can't ship the changes Tristan made to the Sass function definitions without the context stuff working.\n  @glebm Do you recall (or could you find) your Rails/Sass/Compass/compass-rails version numbers when this was true? #366 is yet another context hunt for (I hope) a slightly different version system.\n  You could copy the `bootstrap` file from the repository into your application, and modify it to your needs. As long as it's not called bootstrap it'll work fine.\n  Yeah, this is because I yanked the broken gem.\n  I'll yank the gem when I get back to a computer, I think there might be a fix in the comments on the 3 pull request. \n @trisweb https://github.com/glebm/bootstrap-sass/commit/25399d4478b7fdf54a97a5021e7b39faae92ad74 \n\ncc @glebm\n Would be useful if some people could try running the gem from the repository just to make sure everything is working fine with the new loader across a variety of cases.\n  Hey,\n\nThe Sprockets comments are generally for people using Bootstrap with Rails. If you are just using Compass then you will have to use `<script>` tags as for a normal web app. As part of the bootstrap installation we copy across the js into the /javascripts directory. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n  hm yes. There was more changes than I actually realised, since @trisweb redid some of the framework detection.\n\nI'll see if I get chance to have a look later\n I can't seem to reproduce this. Can you post the first few lines of your `application.css.scss` file? Specifically the lines related to importing files, overriding Bootstrap variables etc.\n\nEdit: I upgraded my app from .beta1 to edge and I still can't repro.\n hm okay, it's probably the combination of Rails & Compass that is causing errors. I don't really have a test app to hand & I've got a bit of uni work to be doing tonight so I'll see if I can have a look tomorrow.\n\nInteresting though that an error is being thrown in including `:application`, since bootstrap is not actually imported there.\n Can you try running them gem from the repository to see if the Sprockets context fixes sort the issue?\n  thanks\n  I just pushed 2.3.1.1, which fixes this. Thank you.\n  I think this is going to get merged in with the massive pull request I have from someone else now! Thanks.\n  I'm pretty sure this won't fix Semver support, Bootstrap might still break their import API across `y` or `z` versions.\n Say Bootstrap updates from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0, and changes the structure of files (as happened before). This breaks the import API, but since our version is pegged to Bootstrap, we release 2.3.0. I'm not sure what the +v will do here, since an API change like that would require us to release a major version bump, right?\n  Bootstrap 3 has RC'ed, so we need to get ready-(ish) to push an update.\n\n`gem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', branch: '3'`\n\nPlease comment on issues here rather than in new issues. +1's will be deleted with vengeance. I make no guarantees about the frequency of updates or responses here.\n\nStuff we have to work on for release:\n- [ ] Icon font compatibility with Rails (\u221a) & Compass (?) - modify functions as appropriate\n- [ ] Update Compass manifest _need to check_\n- [x] Update patch script (_fixed with new converter_)\n- [x] Split docs up\n- [ ] Sass compatibility & documentation - manual installation as copy and paste from download as zip\n- [ ] move to @twbs\n I imagine that the icon fonts don't work given I've not actually tried to load this in an application yet, this is just a straight Sass conversion that will compile (`rake debug`/`rake test`)\n Things to do/think about:\n- version needs to be defined in code and thus accessible to people (for conditionals, see next)\n- Upgrade from 2.3 -> 3 is massive (whole grid is changed, padding etc). Are we going to package 2.3 inside of the 3 gem to allow engines etc to be backwards compatible? Means the engine could update to 3 and apps could stay on 2.3 or vice versa, version detection will need to be used since the location of 2.3 will be different depending on the gem version installed.\n @AJ-Acevedo We're actually ahead of sass-twitter-bootstrap conversion.\n :+1: good work on the converter. We could maintain a list of mixins that are pretty similar (identical) to the CSS3 mixins, and handle those as variable arguments.\n yo @glebm @sporkd etc, thanks for the work on this. Been a bit busy recently to comment, looks like we should get be able to get this out in the next couple of days. Gonna have a look tonight at bringing something like [wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith) in for visual testing, I guess comparing the docs sites. I think something like this was mentioned in the email thread using Poltergeist, but this is the functionality (mostly) already wrapped up.\n I was thinking of versioning issues today. If we have 2.3 archived in a `bootstrap/2.3` folder, we can solve issues with engines like `rails_admin`, which can conditionally include a Bootstrap version based off our defined version number - if the application has b-s 3 installed then rails_admin would include bootstrap/2.3/bootstrap, else it would use the previously defined bootstrap/bootstrap.\n\nOf course, if rails_admin upgrades to b-s 3 then anyone wanting to stop on < 3 is kinda SOL, unless they choose to use static files.\n\nedit: just found this - sferik/rails_admin#1716\n > This still needs a custom helper for non-rails (PR welcome!).\n\nI was thinking we could just instruct people not on the asset pipeline to override the font variable? It's probably the easiest way, given the  various environments people manage to shoehorn this into.\n ah. I was thinking of something much simpler, but I just remembered that the webfont has multiple different extensions.\n @glebm I'm gonna push the Sass as it was at the v3.0.0 tag, can we leave it at that for this PR, and then I'll spend some time working through the remaining issues as far as I can tell wrt testing, Compass etc.\n You want the [Rails install guide](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/docs/RAILS.md)\n Hi Jonathan. You don't need to run the convert task unless you're developing on the gem itself. You probably want the [Rails install guide](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/docs/RAILS.md)\n  I have some work I did on this somewhere on my laptop. I'll see if I can dig it out later.\n\nI don't think upgrading will be much fun though, and will probably be unnecessary for most apps.\n I found the work I had done, although I'll try and update it again today. Check out #329 for a preview.\n  Closing as obsolete. Please reopen if still broken with 3.0.0.0.rc2.\n  Thanks, I rewrote the section slightly.\n  er, possibly?\n\n---\n\nI have used some RequireJS stuff previously (i.e. I'm not particularly familiar with it). Bootstrap by default does not use modules, and so we don't distribute a amd-style Javascripts package since it's not in the upstream. I think you can add a shim of some kind in your definitions files, although I can't be of much assistance with regards to how to actually do that.\n  https://travis-ci.org/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass\n\nThe tests are passing here, so something must be off with your environment. \n  You need to include the responsive styles to get anything `@media` related.\n  If you use sprockets without Rails, I guess nothing happens unless you also use compass? Just wondering.\n\nCode looks sound.\n Been playing with 3 a bit today, got it all converted into Sass and `rake debug` compiling anyway. It uses an icon font rather than images, will have to look into whether Compass has a font-path style helper and rewrite the project template to copy those files across rather than images. Will open an issue to coordinate work for 3, since it's not really relevant here.\n  da88796, thanks\n  Since Bootstrap 2 is EOL, I don't think we'll add the warning. BS3 avoids the problem altogether since there is no longer a separate \"responsive\" file.\n  Travis seems very slow at the moment. I'll let the build run first before merging. Thanks for your work on this.\n :boom:\n  Please see [our guidelines](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bugs) for good bug reports. This sounds like an issue with your code more than our code, but based off what examples you have given I have no idea. I will reopen this if you respond with some more information.\n  Not sure about this on two points.\n\na) Should this check go in lib/bootstrap-sass, so all the framework-detection is in one place\nb) What use case is this for? I added a patch to loosen the Rails check to just Sprockets but I guess this engine file isn't enough for that case, we have to add something to Sprockets itself.\n GOTO #318 \n  Thank you so much for this. I have a feeling this was causing a few other path related issues as well, but I've never worked on/with a Compass project enough to have _needed_ to fix this, or at least find the specific issue. :+1: \n  Yeah, shit. Will try and get a fix out tomorrow morning, probably through reverting the behaviour for now. No laptop right this minute though :unamused: \n  Closing as obsolete. Please reopen if still broken with 3.0.0.0.rc2.\n  :heart:\n  Check that we are all good and registered as an engine etc. Need to look at other gems that bundle assets into Rails.\n https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/test/pages_test.rb\n  Need [scss](http://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap) updated upstream and then we can pull it in.\n  looks good to me :+1: \n  Thanks!\n  Closing as obsolete. Please reopen if still broken with 3.0.0.0.rc2.\n  `width: auto; height: auto;` _are_ the defaults. That is what CSS defines as the default values of width and height, so they should not cause problems. The reset.css _should_ not overwrite any other values, since it will be defined at the HTML level prior to any document or custom CSS is loaded.\n\nIt may be `max-width: 100%;` that's messing up. Try adding `max-width: auto;` instead.\n\nYou may also want to try the solution proposed of loading isotope in `window.load` instead of `document.ready`\n\nBut the answer is basically that those two variables cannot be \"undone\" because they are already in their \"undone\" state.\n\nSince you've already submitted this to twitter/bootstrap and we're in sync with them upstream, I'm going to close this issue here. I think your best bet will be to discuss it on the isotope issue. Thanks and good luck.\n One more note - you may look at the order the CSS declarations are loaded. Ensure your `reset.scss` (and bootstrap) is loaded first, then any isotope css after.\n  Do you have any viewable examples of the site or page this is occurring on? It would be useful to be able to reproduce this.\n\nLikely it's a big in our upstream project, twitter/bootstrap if you want to look for related issues there.\n  Not a bug, but it's something you have control over. Sounds like you should either conditionally display the DIVs (by moving the div inside a conditional checking for any error content) or use `display: none;` and conditionally display it using javascript. Hope this helps!\n  Looks like this is actually a bug in Rails, not our project or sass: rails/rails#660\n  Not sure what you mean by bootstrap checkboxes\u2014they should just be normal HTML checkboxes, with bootstrap styling. I don't think this is the right place to look for help with that. Try posting to a Bootstrap-related or HTML-related forum.\n  @barmstrong - I had the same problem. 2.2.2 did NOT fix dropdowns on mobile. It's really this pull that will fix it if merged: twitter/bootstrap#6488\n\nHere's a temporary workaround that worked for me. Place this in your JS after the bootstrap JS is loaded:\n\n``` javascript\n  // Temp Fix: Remove after Bootstrap does the right thing and removes touchstart (see issue https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/6488)\n  $('a.dropdown-toggle, .dropdown-menu, .dropdown-menu a, .dropdown-menu .dropdown-submenu a').on('touchstart.dropdown.data-api', function (e) {\n    e.stopPropagation();\n  });\n```\n\nOnce a fix is (hopefully) in the next version, we'll pull it in from upstream.\n @barmstrong correction, I'm doing some more research. 2.2.2 did not appear to fix anything for me, though this line from this pull _should_ be the fix: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/270/files#L8R157\n  While there is not a separate file, `@import variables.scss` will import all the Bootstrap [variables](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss), which includes the colours.\n  This is fixed in our [upstream](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/blob/master/lib/_variables.scss#L61) so when we pull it down for 2.2.2 it will be fixed.\n\nCheers!\n  I don't have a rebuild button either, so it's not that.\n\nThanks though.\n  Can you look at your application.js line 9903, col: 9 and see what the issue might be?\n\nMy instincts say this is a `>` character used outside of a CDATA block, and that's why something's complaining. But it's difficult to say.\n Indeed it is, I'm just trying to get a better idea of where the issue is occurring.\n\nI've just checked every single usage of the `>` character in the JS bootstrap source and they're all proper, so it's likely that it's caused by something else, possibly in combination with the included files.\n\nIs there any compiled output at all, or does the asset compilation fail completely?\n No problem! Thanks and good luck.\n  This looks nice but is fairly rails-specific. I think these might be good in a helper within your app, perhaps a separate bootstrap-rails-extras project? @thomas-mcdonald what do you think?\n Awesome stuff, but does not belong in this project\n  Thanks. It's unlikely that these are related to sass itself, since they seem like style adjustments. There were several bugs and changes between bootstrap 2.1 and 2.2 and you likely noticed a few fixes and changes that are expected. You should go over the [changelog here](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/wiki/Changelog) and perhaps update your own project to match.\n\nI personally noticed several changes that I had to \"fix\" in my project, including the fact that the default trigger for the Popover tooltip switched to 'click,' and several small margins and sizes were different. I think this may be considered normal, but if you find any you think are problems feel free to report them to bootstrap.\n Either way this should be submitted/fixed upstream in twitter/bootstrap - watch there and when we merge in a new version we'll pull any fixes. Thanks!\n  Verified that as of 2.2.1 !default is applied to all relevant variables (sometimes not those which are derived from others, but that's necessary for compatibility within the rest of the library). Should be good now.\n  Add a global `Sass.load_paths` entry for our load path. This should make our @imports rock solid on any Sass 3.2+ installation. Nice feature added in Sass 2.3 - see nex3/sass@5c93cbfe - based on a similar issue and request by a gem, nex3/sass#131\n\nThis should resolve thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#259 better than making users manually adding a load_paths entry, and prevent issues in the future.\n Note that this doesn't help #259 because it wasn't initializing the gem... as it was being used from a PHP project (and ignoring all gem files and just using our vendor/assets/stylesheets). Uses like that should use [sass-twitter-bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap) instead and we should really concentrate on being a ruby gem. :)\n\nIn any case, this `load_paths` change is still a good thing as it will lock in the reliability of our imports; they should work in all cases as long as the `load_path` is set.\n Maybe I was confused, this was a while back. Let me dig up some artefacts here...\n\nBasically our use of absolute paths (correctly, [here](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/bootstrap.scss)) should all just work since /vendor/assets/stylesheets _should_ be added as a load path by default, you are correct.\n\nI studied Sass' importer a lot while debugging the above (which turned out to be a non-issue, but anyway). [See relevant source here](https://github.com/nex3/sass/blob/stable/lib/sass/tree/import_node.rb#L47). My conclusion is that imports are only found by **relative** path below the directory of _the originally compiled sass file_ (if for some reason someone imports our bootstrap from `/assets/stylesheets/subdirectory/styles.scss` then only **absolute** imports under `/*/stylesheets/subdirectory/` will be found. This is expected and the reason we changed to absolute paths in the first place (see #258), though somewhat counter-intuitive (one would think that relative imports would also be found under load_paths, but this is in fact not true, only absolute paths can be used under `load_paths`).\n\nWith this pull, I simply noticed this new feature of Sass 3 (`Sass.load_paths`) to allow libraries to specify load_paths directly.\n\n[The documentation](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass.html#load_paths-class_method) says \"This is meant for plugins and libraries to register the paths to their Sass stylesheets to that they may be @imported.\" Basically, it's designed exactly for our purpose, and solidifies our absolute import paths no matter what the parent application sets in its configuration. You can see the original issue that added it had a similar request: nex3/sass#131\n\nSo it's not entirely necessary as long as the framework includes the correct `load_paths`, but it's proper for us to do this and ensures it will work no matter what. I think that's a good thing.\n Proof of the absolute vs. relative quirk: try this out in a rails console.\n\n``` ruby\nSass.load_paths << \"/full/path/to/bootstrap-sass/gem/vendor/assets/stylesheets\"\nSass::Engine.for_file(\"app/assets/stylesheets/youroriginalsass.scss\", {}).options[:load_paths].last.send(:find, 'variables.scss', {})\n# nil\nSass::Engine.for_file(\"app/assets/stylesheets/youroriginalsass.scss\", {}).options[:load_paths].last.send(:find, 'bootstrap/variables.scss', {})\n# Sass::Engine for variables.scss....\n```\n\nSo relative paths still have the issue of being based at the directory of the originally compiled .scss file, and `load_paths` paths (added by either the framework or by us) are absolute only. Pretty quirky and not well documented, but it works as long as we have a correct `load_paths` entry.\n  Same here, can't reproduce and all works well with `@import \"bootstrap/variables\";`\n\nAre you using sass with Rails or Compass? Or without either?\n\nI have to say, it's not easy to determine how sass treats imports. But my conclusion from debugging these paths yesterday is that it attempts to find a relative path from the directory of the top-level compiled .sass file first, and then an absolute path underneath the `load_paths` config variable. (See [source](https://github.com/nex3/sass/blob/stable/lib/sass/tree/import_node.rb#L44) of the `@import` parser node)\n\nIf you're working outside rails, you should add your root CSS path to `load_paths` and it will find the absolute path.\n\nUnfortunately, sass does not use relative paths relative to the current file being processed (as CSS does!), but only relative to the initially compiled file\u2014AKA the one you originally called `@import \"bootstrap\"` from.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because using a relative path works in more cases to find the correct file by name, but it causes other issues: since the original import could be anywhere in the filesystem, using relative paths is not reliable.\n\nHence, I settled on absolute because I believe it will be more reliable, but I'm open to discussion.\n\nSo, you should be able to add a load_path and make this work. Try something like this untested snippet:\n\n``` ruby\n(Sass::Plugin.options[:load_paths] ||= []) << \"#{YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT}/bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets\"\n```\n\nMore info: apparently [sass-rails considers this a 'feature.'](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/issues/82) (also describes the behavior quite well). Personally I'd much prefer it to behave like CSS does and always be relative to the current file, but maybe that's just me.\n @thomas-mcdonald Do you think there's a way for us to add a sass config `load_paths` entry during init? Might make imports work in almost any config.\n @ornj - it would be different based on your config, but most likely in the `sass` initializer. In compass it would be `config/initializers/sass.rb`\n\n``` ruby\nSass::Engine::DEFAULT_OPTIONS[:load_paths].tap do |load_paths|\n  load_paths << File.expand_path \"../../bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets\", __FILE__ \nend\n```\n\n(Adjust the relative path to be from wherever that initializer is stored)\n\nBut again, I'd like to figure out a way to automate this. I will keep you posted.\n\nCan you give us more information about how exactly your project is set up?\n We're in luck - check this out, from sass 3.2 - nex3/sass@5c93cbf\n\nWe should add our path to this so our absolute paths always work. @ornj stay tuned.\n Interesting. I don't see any integration with this ruby gem package in those projects\u2014are you importing it separately or using it alongside?\n Ah, nice. Thanks for the link.\n\nI have a fix you can test. Change your library path to use `trisweb/bootstrap` and this git repo: https://github.com/trisweb/bootstrap-sass.git - basically replace `thomas-mcdonald` with `trisweb` (temporarily until my pull #260 is merged). Let me know if it works better.\n The load path isn't being used. What version of Sass do you have installed? (`sass -v`) (FYI we require minimum 3.2, but it doesn't seem that the packager in the code above installs dependencies according to the gemspec...)\n Ah, right, because you're not using ruby at all. Nothing will be initialized.\n\nFundamentally, this project is a ruby gem; we require initialization of the gem. Otherwise we have little control over anything.\n\nIf you just want to use a sass version of bootstrap, try [sass-twitter-bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap), which is a 1-to-1 translation of bootstrap to sass.\n\nIn either case, you should maybe open an issue with MopaBootstrapBundle instead. This is fairly well outside my knowledge space and it would be good to get some people on it from the PHP side. Really what we need is a sass load_paths entry for our path, just like Compass and Blueprint have above. However those paths were initialized, they need also be initialized for bootstrap-sass stylesheets path too.\n\nBut personally, if you're not using this as a ruby gem initialized from a ruby project, I highly recommend not using our rubygem and using sass-twitter-bootstrap instead.\n  Thanks for the patch!\n\nReading through the sass [source code for the import node in sass](https://github.com/nex3/sass/blob/stable/lib/sass/tree/import_node.rb#L47), looks like sass is actually doing something interesting here. First it searches for relative references under the root directory, which is the directory of the original .scss file being compiled. Next, it searches the `load_paths` for an absolute path (the assets/stylesheets directory is one by default, which makes sense). So here we're actually changing this to an absolute reference by making that 2nd condition work (since no file is found using the relative search).\n\nIt broke when importing bootstrap from a scss file in a subdirectory because the relative path isn't found under the dirname of the original file, and the absolute path isn't found (because it's under the /bootstrap subdirectory).\n\nSo your version is more correct and better because it uses absolute paths. I think this is a good thing as it will be less error prone, and because our files are always at the same location under the gem's vendor/assets/stylesheets folder. \n\n[Side note: I was confused because this does not match the behavior of CSS itself, which uses the same `@import` syntax, but always respects paths relative to the current file. The `@import` in SASS is a different directive with a different implementation and behavior. In many ways SASS' `@import` is smarter since it will actually attempt to find a filename (with no directory prefix) in any subdirectory of the current folder and even handles conflicts if multiple files are found. Anyway, I digress :) ]\n\nI'll merge now and hopefully we can get 2.2.1.1 out ASAP to resolve this.\n  Yep, sprockets-sass' `image_url` is calling our `image_path`, but we intend to use compass'  separately defined `image_url` in `image_path`, so it goes into an infinite loop. This is an incompatibility with sprockets-sass and compass when used together with bootstrap-sass.\n\nWe're basically taking the opposite strategy that sprokets-sass is using and calling `image_url` directly with the path_only option (2nd argument true); meanwhile they're relying on their own `image_path` to return a path-only version of the url.\n\nGood detective work, thanks for giving us all the clues.\n\nI am unsure how to proceed on this. My instinct says that since sprokets-sass provides a perfectly working `image_path`, we should simply not define it if already defined.\n\nActually [this would seem to indicate](https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-sass/blob/master/lib/sprockets/sass/functions.rb#L147) that sprockets-sass plays nice with predefined functions. Can you try loading sprockets-sass after bootstrap-sass and see if that makes a difference?\n Apologies, I haven't had enough time lately to look at this.\n\nIf you want to fork the gem, the cleanest temp fix would be to remove the compass `image_url` branch of the if statement in `image_path` (see 2fc8201565b7e95d0ca1705c71597b192035603d) to prevent it from going into an infinite loop. You could also try removing the function altogether.\n\nWhat I don't quite understand is, if you're not using compass, how does it get to that branch? Can you describe your setup a little more and provide a full stack trace if possible?\n Good idea. Any news on this or ideas on how to proceed?\n this _should_ be fixed, finally.\n  I like this very much, gives a quick way to start based on the new bootstrap templates. @thomas-mcdonald any comment?\n [this](bootstrap-sass-extras) project has a set of generators, this is a bit out of scope\n  I think there is a very good case for you to keep it in your own codebase. IMHO Bootstrap provides a very good naming convention and uses good class namespacing. Adding a prefix, even if optional, would make things messy and  more difficult to read and understand. Again, that's just my own opinion, but I think it makes sense to keep the default very clean and generic and allow you to modify it for your own needs. I think it's very possible and there are many ways you could do this.\n\nI particularly like this solution: (by @owenallenaz) (works just as well for sass)\n\n> Since bootstrap is built using less, it makes it very simple to fix this whole namespacing issue. In my case I take the compiled .css file (bootstrap.css and bootstrap-responsive.css) and wrap the entirety of it in a single class and then run it through a less compiler again. This way I only have to modify 2 files to namespace the whole deal.\n\nThis stackoverflow discussion as well: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8288463/wrap-a-less-css-definitions-in-a-namespace/10971228#10971228\n\nHopefully that suffices.\n\nWe want to try to keep as much compatibility as possible with Bootstrap upstream, so it's unlikely we will add this feature. I'd be curious what others think though!\n  Please submit upstream to [twitter/bootstrap](http://www.github.com/twitter/bootstrap) - we won't be accepting patches to bootstrap code here.\n Absolutely, and thanks for the patch\u2014looks great. However we basically take boostrap code and package it, so it would be better if this was merged in upstream and then reached us. It's just a process. I do encourage you to submit it to the bootstrap project as that is where the code originates. Thanks again!\n  @m5o - This is definitely fixed in #246. Thanks.\n\nSee this change line (nice we get to see the diff since the old/new files are in the same location now)\n\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/246/files#L43L400\n\nClosing this pull since it will be redundant shortly.\n  Hi @jpg - the media objects were added in Bootstrap 2.2. We're at 2.1.1, but we're currently in the process of updating the gem, and integrating it with the [sass-twitter-bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/) project to make future updates faster and easier.\n\nYou can see the pull for the update at #246, and the new `_media.scss` file [here](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/246/files#diff-42).\n\nIt should be merged in the next couple days, and after updating you'll be able to use those styles normally. Sorry for the delay!\n Dup of #244\n  I've converted bootstrap-sass to use sass-twitter-bootstrap here, while updating it to the latest version. This pull provides Bootstrap 2.2.1 as currently ported by jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap@a95350ca4d and a script to efficiently and quickly update the sass-twitter-bootstrap code into the bootstrap-sass gem (I did this mostly as an experiment, so I'm open to using, say, a submodule instead, but this will work as a highly functional proof-of-concept).\n\nI've modified the paths slightly in order to better match sass-twitter-bootstrap's layout, but generally it was a straight copy. The steps (as outlined in the update script) are basically:\n1. Remove old `stylesheets/` directory\n2. Copy `lib/*` => `stylesheets/`\n3. Copy `js/*` => `javascripts/`\n4. Copy `img/*` => `images/`\n5. Patch `_variables.scss` to use `asset-path` instead of relative paths.\n\nRequires `sass >= 3.2` of course. Updated the gemspec.\n\nHighly relevant to thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#244\n Forgot to mention\u2014tested this in unit (compilation) tests, and subsequently on a complex bootstrap-heavy production site (in dev). Looking great so far with no obvious problems, only those expected from the 2.1 -> 2.2 upgrade. I'll probably hold off using this on prod just yet but it looks promising.\n One last note\u2014I haven't tested this in compass, so if someone else wants to do that it would be great. Can't see it being an issue though.\n Since this package is mainly intended for production distribution, I would vote no. I'll remove them.\n @thomas-mcdonald tests removed, good to go. Any other concerns with these changes?\n I never thought about that case\u2014all of my customizations/overrides have been done in separate files after importing the entire bootstrap tree, and I didn't have similarly named files, so it wasn't a problem for me personally.\n\nYou're absolutely right that many of the bootstrap names are very generic and would be better namespaced into the `bootstrap/` folder. I think that should be done. I'll do that and get back to you.\n\nIt doesn't make it too difficult to upgrade; we may have to do some things manually at first (mainly the main import file) but it shouldn't be too hard to script it. I'll see what I can do.\n\nThanks for adding me as a committer! I'll try to help with updates in the future as well.\n @wyaeld that's great to know, thanks. I will definitely set it up in a subdirectory at least to prevent namespace conflicts with other CSS files.\n\nJust so you are aware, bootstrap's `variables.scss` file uses `!default` for all variables, which means \"set this variable only if it hasn't already been set.\" Because of that, any variables you define prior to importing bootstrap will be preserved and used.\n\nIn other words, you could just do:\n\n``` css\n@import \"my_app/variables\"\n@import \"bootstrap\"\n@import \"my_app/custom_css\"\n```\n\nand the result would be exactly the same. Hope this is helpful, and if there's something I'm missing please let me know.\n (Sorry, submitted comment early... resubmitting)\n\nOk, I think this is very clean after the latest commits above.\n- New `/bootstrap` subdirectory (under `vendor/assets/stylesheets`) & move all bootstrap css files there.\n- Keep only `bootstrap.scss` and `bootstrap-responsive.scss` in the root stylesheets folder (they simply import `bootstrap/bootstrap` and `bootstrap/responsive` respectively). They will allow us to control the imports at a higher level (eg: if bootstrap decides to rename their main file, we don't have to change our API)\n- `bootstrap-responsive.scss` is no longer deprecated! It's a better name at the top level than just `responsive.scss` since the latter could cause naming conflicts with other top-level css files.\n- Updated scripts to continue to handle updates from sass-twitter-bootstrap easily.\n +1, any updates? (I know it's a busy day here in the states, so no big deal if not, just curious)\n @thomas-mcdonald what's your status? If you want I can take care of merge and packaging, if that's even possible.\n @thomas-mcdonald hope you had a good weekend. Where are we on this? \n1. What needs to be done if we decide to go with the Bootstrap opacity mixin defaults rather than changing them?\n2. What are the consequences for compass, and can we provide an official workaround (automatically in code, or well documented) to avoid issues?\n Sounds good to me. Thanks for the response!\n :point_up: :question:\n @thomas-mcdonald any timeline for this? Any blockers on pushing this out that I can help with?\n My pleasure! Thanks for merging and your diligence in spotting compatibility issues.\n  Hi @pefavre - I will attempt to reproduce this soon - but to debug, you could try to use your browser's CSS inspector and see if the `img-circle` class is being respected, or perhaps overridden or not included.\n  Yes, Bootstrap 2.2 is out, yes I've been lagging behind a little bit, let's change that. This release will bump to requiring Sass 3.2 or higher, hurrah.\n\nSubscribe as per usual below with the dropdown.\n If my understanding is correct, sass-twitter-bootstrap is just bootstrap ported to sass, nothing more nothing less (no pun intended).\n\nMy ideal configuration (and I assume the ideal dev configuration to reduce rework & copying) would be for bootstrap-sass to use sass-twitter-bootstrap for all the sass sources, and make a cleanly packaged gem out of it that works like the existing bootstrap-sass config. I'm sure that's what we were all thinking, but I agree, it sounds like a great plan.\n Well, that was surprisingly easy.\n  Use #{} around your parameters, or a set of double parenthesis. [There's a note in the README with an example](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#passing-multiple-values-to-mixins)\n\nSince we still support Sass 3.1 which doesn't support the `...` multiple parameter as a single parameter magic. :(\n  Breaks on Sass 3.1, unfortunately. You can use #{} around the call to box-shadow.\n  Not quite that simple, we have to define image-url as a Compass function as well. I'll make the change though.\n We [define](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/compass_functions.rb) a custom Compass function, so it _could_ do, I guess. Compass isn't exactly my area of expertise though (I rarely use it).\n Note: compass already has an `image_url` https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/blob/stable/lib/compass/sass_extensions/functions/urls.rb#L83\n\n@ryankask - In switching to using `image-path` in #246 I also updated the compass helper function to use the existing `image_url` helper, so all compass path configuration would work as expected if that were to be merged. If someone using compass could test out that fork, that would be very helpful.\n  Breaks on Sass 3.1, unfortunately. You can use #{} around the call to box-shadow.\n  You should submit this upstream to [twitter/bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) if you haven't already and the fixes are still needed as of 2.2.1.\n\nWe won't be making changes to the bootstrap core, just converting to sass and packaging the gem. Thanks!\n  I'm fairly sure that this is an issue with the asset pipeline and how it handles load paths on separate drives as opposed to an issue with how we create the engine. I'm not sure there's a workaround that I can implement. \n\nYou could use bundle install to install the gems local to your project as opposed to on your other drive. Seems to work for a few others [here](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/issues/270#issuecomment-7355136)\n  Is this only an issue for nested modals? Is there even a use case for those?\n\nI'll probably merge this later but I'll have a read through the linked issues first. \n This fix isn't in our domain, as it's in core bootstrap JS, and we'll get the change upstream from them if it's merged in. Looks like you've got that process rolling, so I'll go ahead and close this one.\n  https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/buttons.less#L30\n\nLooks like it's white upstream, although it seems like an odd decision. Needs an issue there as well, I'll leave this for tonight since I've got to dash off.\n Yep, unfortunately it is wrong. We'll stick to the bootstrap defaults for the distribution. If you would like to customize those colors, you're welcome to do so after importing bootstrap in your own project.\n  oops. thanks.\n  Done, although not pushed yet.\n  My only thoughts based on that error is that it looks like bootstrap-sass might not be in the load path, which would be... odd.\n Closing as obsolete. Reopen if still broken with 3.0.0.0.rc2.\n  Part of the 2.1.1 update, sorry it's late!\n  `gradient-vertical` is picking a value halfway between f2f2f2 and e5e5e5 I presume as a fallback. A bug in upstream, will leave this open to remind me to open a bug.\n  Yeah sorry about how long that took. I've just moved halfway across the country to university and I've had a hectic first couple of weeks.\n  Unless I've implemented it wrong, this is in the bootstrap-sass codebase, and a quick browse through the generated source shows it gets generated.\n\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss#L577\n  This is in 2.1.1, which there is a pull request for. Hoping to push it out later once I've gone through the issues against 2.1.0.\n  I thought this problem had gone away. Perhaps it's Sass < 3.2 still.\n wait, don't you get this on every instance of transparent?\n Can't reproduce, but I'll fix anyway. What version of Sass?\n  What environment are you on? `$iconSpritePath` gets it's value from a call to a function `asset-url`, which is defined differently depending on whether you are using Rails or Compass. Compass should already have `url()`, while I don't know what Rails does internally.\n Seems odd, works for me (and others) so I'm going to close this one. I know people had issues by following an out of date tutorial that suggested you had to override the sprite path, but it might just be a particular configuration oddity.\n  Aside from the lack of `!default`s in the variables file, it looks good to me.\n  er oops, thanks.\n  thanks.\n  Gonna go through this once I push out a bugfix for 2.1.0, hoping to get it pushed later today.\n  Problem here is that it's basically impossible to conditionally require files within Sass. My past recommendation has been to copy `_bootstrap` from the repository and create a custom require file (named something else, otherwise you'll get conflicts). Within this file, you basically need to switch out the sprites `@import` tag for the font-awesome tag. This should work, unless font-awesome-sass-rails does some extra hackery that _requires_ the sprite files to be loaded, in which case you'll just have to push css around until it appears to work.\n I use Font Awesome in my hobby hack project, QA w/bootstrap-sass & font-awesome-sass-rails now, so I can comment on this a little more.\n\nI basically did as I suggested earlier, which was to copy over `bootstrap.scss` from this repo and then remove the sprite declaration, as [app/assets/stylesheets/_custom-bootstrap.scss](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/qa/blob/c0bdb100480d738054187fd4000a4f91fdca0717/app/assets/stylesheets/_custom-bootstrap.css.scss). This is then included in [app/assets/stylesheets/_application.scss](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/qa/blob/c0bdb100480d738054187fd4000a4f91fdca0717/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss), with the `font-awesome` import just afterwards.\n\nThis may make it harder to upgrade - you'll have to copy over the bootstrap.scss file and modify it every time a new component is added - but this is only going to be rarely and it completely removes the sprites declarations. I'd love to build in support for font-awesome but since afaik Sass doesn't support conditional imports there's not much I can do. Bootstrap 3 uses the glyphicons icon font, which will be removable as per above.\n  Sass < 3.2 doesn't support variables in media breakpoints, which is why we don't use it yet.\n When #246 is merged (within the next couple days, most likely) then we will be in-sync with Bootstrap 2.2.1 and upgraded to Sass 3.2.1, and we will use the `$navbarCollapseWidth` variable correctly.\n\nSee the change here: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/246/files#L55L8\n\nWhen our 2.2.1.0 is out, it will work!\n  Stacked bars are working fine for me with the latest bootstrap-sass 2.1.0.1. The issue is closed probably because it's very unlikely that the problem comes from bootstrap-sass specifically.\n\nMake sure no other CSS styles are conflicting, and use your browsers style inspector to try to debug the issue and see what is causing the CSS to display as it does.\n\nIt's possible that the next release will fix this as we are moving to the Bootstrap 2.2.1 version, which may contain bug fixes.\n Tony, this is the bootstrap-sass gem, not twitter-bootstrap-rails -- check\ntheir github page or switch to this gem perhaps?\n  Er, try reinstalling it? Aside I'm at a loss. Shouldn't be an issue with the gem.\n  This was fixed this morning in 3f13cfd, you'll need to update your bundle.\n  oops, must have missed that one! Cheers.\n  Thanks!\n  Those are just standard assets which are part of the [Bootstrap documentation](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/master/docs/assets/ico), and are not included in the Bootstrap release.\n  The makeFluidColumn mixin was a bit of a hack that I put together that didn't quite work exactly as it should have. I'll have to have a look at how fluid columns are structured now (generator code seems to have changed a bit) and I'll add that back in tonight.\n  Thanks, pushed 2.0.4.2 now with this fix!\n  Are these changes from 2.0.x or 2.1?\n :) 2.1 is coming soonish.\n  Upstream actually has `tooltip.less`. Our filenames are mirrored from Twitter's repository.\n\nYup, really the Javascript should be in folders, but it's how I started doing it and there's a lot of apps dependent on the javascript being named as is, so for now (perhaps until the next major release) it'll carry on as-is.\n  Those were changed in 2.1, right? You might want to try the 2.1-wip branch.\n  Yup, these are in the 2.1-wip branch now until a new release is out.\n  Yes they are, use the 2.1-wip branch until I push a new release.\n  `gem 'bootstrap-sass', git: 'git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', branch: '2.1-wip'`\n\nA combination of the changes in #185 and some bits redone (grid generation), as well as (what should be, travis is down) fixes for Sass 3.1.\n\nGive it a whirl and create a _new_ issue if you find problems, although I've replaced the compiled output with the documentation CSS and everything looked fine, so there hopefully shouldn't be too many. I'll push a gem release in a couple of days if there's no more issues to report.\n Pushed the gem yo.\n  You can use the 2.1-wip branch now, which has this fix in. Sorry for the late response.\n  Is this Rails or Compass? Not familiar with `--relative-assets`, sorry.\n\nIf it's Compass, we define asset-url as a new Sass function because it's not actually a function, which does need a hardcoded value. For Rails, it should just work, as asset-url comes as part of the framework (think it's in sass-rails)\n  Taken from a generated file:\n\n```\n.label-success, .badge-success {\n  background-color: #468847;\n}\n```\n\nNot sure how you're getting white. Have you cleared your .sass-cache?\n  It's a bit late, but there are some themes here you could use\n\nhttp://sass-bootswatch.theblacksmithhq.com/\n  Check this Gist, seems like somebody else has got it working.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/3668587\n  Thanks for report. I reconverted the whole navbar file and pushed 2.0.3.1, so this should be fixed now.\n  Should be fixed in 2.0.3.1, cheers.\n  It's possible this is related to #145/#146, which should be fixed in 2.0.3.1. Have you got a simple test case I can use to debug?\n  I submitted sferik/rails_admin#1131, provides a fix to rails_admin.\n  I _think_ that this was caused by a regression in 2.0.2. It should be fixed in the 2.0.3 branch, but I'll have to check it out later to be sure.\n The following test case (taken from Bootstrap docs) seems to render fine in the 2.0.3 branch, which means I can release _very soon_ \u2122:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"stylesheets/styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <form>\n      <div class=\"control-group\">\n        <label class=\"control-label\" for=\"prependedInput\">Prepended text</label>\n        <div class=\"controls\">\n          <div class=\"input-prepend\">\n            <span class=\"add-on\">@</span><input class=\"span2\" id=\"prependedInput\" size=\"16\" type=\"text\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </form>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n  I made these changes as part of the restructuring of the Readme I just did, cheers!\n  Hi Ryan\n\nThanks for the pull request, but I think these changes are already in the [2.0.3 branch](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/2.0.3/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_navbar.scss#L326).\n  Yeah, let me fix that. By the way, do your outputted stylesheets include `ie-hex-str` or `asset-path`?\n 2a9d9bf4f should fix this, cheers.\n  The [2.0.3](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/tree/2.0.3) branch already has these changes, for release 'soon'.\n\nCheers.\n  :+1:\n\nThanks.\n  :unamused: I'll have to revert it to the old way of doing it.\n [Greened](http://travis-ci.org/#!/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/builds/1312160) in cf14f13b4, huzzah!\n Aye, I was trying to mimic the Bootstrap way of doing it, but in the end it just added complexity. And it didn't work.\n  ``` scss\nbackground-color: darken($white, 10%);\n*background-color: darken($white, 15%); // Buttons in IE7 don't get borders, so darken on hover\n```\n\nThis is the declaration as it currently stands wrt. `$btnBackgroundHighlight`. While I'd prefer to use that, I'm not _entirely_ sure what to do with the IE7 hack. I think mathematically darkening the variable by around 4.5% will be identical, or should I remove the hack?\n  _drumroll_.\n aaand shipped. :shipit:\n\nSorry for the delay on this one, yet again I have exams looming which determine whether I meet my offer to study at Oxford or not.\n  Not unless Bootstrap starts doing it, I imagine.\n  Markup is wrong I think. `.fluid-row` should be `.row-fluid`. The below sample works fine in 2.0.3.\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"stylesheets/styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"row-fluid\">\n      <section class=\"span8\">content</section>\n      <section class=\"span4\">content</section>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n  ugh, as if I just merged this into master. _opens eyes_\n\nI'll basically copy-paste this note into the Readme for 2.0.3, since I want to restructure the Readme a bit anyway.\n\nCheers.\n  @alberto-santini I just pushed some changes to the 2.0.3 branch, which should (hopefully) work. Let me know if it fixes the issue.\n\nAlso, can you check that `[class^=\"icon-\"], [class*=\" icon-\"]` has a proper background-image, rather than a Sass method call? Cheers.\n This should be all sorted in 2.0.3 now.\n  We use `asset-url(image, var)` by default, which _should_ (or at least on my system, does) just work. For the most part you shouldn't need to override `$imageSpritePath`, although I'm aware that if you followed the Railscast Ryan's code will break the sprite path.\n  Nope, [this wasn't changed until 2.0.2](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/2.0.2/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_scaffolding.scss). It will be in the new release.\n  I've answered your question on Stack Overflow. Let me know if it solves the issue.\n\nThe issue @ajjahn is referring to is the comment normalisation issue, I believe.\n  Do you have a javascript file named bootstrap at all? That appears to be the issue in the Railscast episode.\n Yeah: Sprockets will find the bootstrap file in `app/assets/javascripts` and include it before it looks in `gem/vendor`. I need to add a note to the readme about this actually, I have done for stylesheets, but not javascripts.\n  .btn-mini didn't exist in 2.0.1, but it's in the 2.0.2 branch. Perhaps you should try that.\n\nNot sure about the background colour though, I'll have to have a look.\n  You can do this on the 2.0.2 branch, which should be shipping soon.\n  While I understand the benefits, I'm not too sure about moving away from how Bootstrap does it - some people may rely on the existing behaviour.\n  This needs to have its merge target as branch 2.0.2, not master. Cheers!\n  :+1:\n\nCan you change this to be against the 2.0.2 branch, though? Thanks.\n Fixed in 2.0.2.\n  :+1:\n\nnot sure how that one slipped through my net, thanks.\n  Can you change the branch this is against to 2.0.2? Thanks.\n  I'm on it.\n The conversion of the 2.0.2 branch is mostly finished, although I have to go through some bugs today and see what I can do with them, they are mostly related to the framework of the engine/extension rather than the SCSS. Feel free to go ahead and give it a whirl.\n\nOne particular caveat: if you use a static navbar, the container now has width:auto rather than a width of 940px. see twitter/bootstrap#2565 for more details.\n I'm doing it by hand, so I have no converter to add to source control.\n Just pushed 2.0.2, enjoy.\n  I've just tried profiling this, it's still tripping up over that method (or it appears to be)\n  this is in the 2.0.2 branch now\n  Yeah, you only need to put that in your `config.rb` file if you're using Compass.\n  fixed in 2.0.2\n  Fixed in 2.0.2. Links to that rather excellent explanation, in fact.\n  You could use a custom helper, and just comment out the sprites line. Basing this off the _bootstrap.css.scss file:\n\n``` scss\n/*!\n * Bootstrap 2.0.1\n *\n * Copyright 2012 Twitter, Inc\n * Licensed under the Apache License v2.0\n * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Designed and built with all the love in the world @twitter by @mdo and @fat.\n * Converted to SASS by Thomas McDonald\n */\n\n// Core variables and mixins\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\"; // Modify this for custom colors, font-sizes, etc\n@import \"bootstrap/mixins\";\n\n// CSS Reset\n@import \"bootstrap/reset\";\n\n// Grid system and page structure\n@import \"bootstrap/scaffolding\";\n@import \"bootstrap/grid\";\n@import \"bootstrap/layouts\";\n\n// Base CSS\n@import \"bootstrap/type\";\n@import \"bootstrap/code\";\n@import \"bootstrap/forms\";\n@import \"bootstrap/tables\";\n\n// Components: common\n// @import \"bootstrap/sprites\";\n@import \"bootstrap/dropdowns\";\n@import \"bootstrap/wells\";\n@import \"bootstrap/component-animations\";\n@import \"bootstrap/close\";\n\n// Components: Buttons & Alerts\n@import \"bootstrap/buttons\";\n@import \"bootstrap/button-groups\";\n@import \"bootstrap/alerts\"; // Note: alerts share common CSS with buttons and thus have styles in buttons.less\n\n// Components: Nav\n@import \"bootstrap/navs\";\n@import \"bootstrap/navbar\";\n@import \"bootstrap/breadcrumbs\";\n@import \"bootstrap/pagination\";\n@import \"bootstrap/pager\";\n\n// Components: Popovers\n@import \"bootstrap/modals\";\n@import \"bootstrap/tooltip\";\n@import \"bootstrap/popovers\";\n\n// Components: Misc\n@import \"bootstrap/thumbnails\";\n@import \"bootstrap/labels\";\n@import \"bootstrap/progress-bars\";\n@import \"bootstrap/accordion\";\n@import \"bootstrap/carousel\";\n@import \"bootstrap/hero-unit\";\n\n// Utility classes\n@import \"bootstrap/utilities\"; // Has to be last to override when necessary\n```\n Yes, pretty much, just make sure it's not called bootstrap, otherwise you'll get an import loop error.\n\nConditional file loading would potentially make this much easier to implement. I'll look into that.\n  Can't reproduce this anymore, let me know if it's still an issue.\n  This is part of a larger fix that came in after 2.0.1 was actually released and was pushed into master, I believe.\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/3d58b4622671bc51c22c857641db3b988e73632a\n I pushed a branch with the fix, so you can specify the fixes branch in Bundler.\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git', :branch => :fixes\n```\n  It's almost certainly related to that.\n\nI'm going to push out a branch with some javascript fixes that can be used until 2.0.2 is out.\n Sorry for the slow response.\n\nThis will be fixed in the next gem release, which will be soon(ish). When it's released you can use the command `bundle update bootstrap-sass` to update the gem, provided your version specificity allows this.\n  I'll merge this with 2.0.2.\n\nOnce I get a 2.0.2 branch up can I get you to chance the branch to that?\n This is in 2.0.2 now, thanks!\n  This will get fixed in 2.0.2.\n  The README contains a link to Bootstrap's variable list and gives instructions on how to modify them. Copying the entire variables file seems unnecessary - most people will only want to configure a few variables.\n\nThe import helper I agree with, to an extent. It was something I began developing when bootstrap-sass only supported Rails but I abandoned it due to issue with how sass-rails looks at load paths. However, once #70 gets fixed, I think unpacking will be the 'supported' way to customise bootstrap-sass with compass - then you have total control over all customisation.\n (probably) fixed in #345 \n  > Sorry, just realized that even more explicit instructions are needed. If the file containing the @import statement is loaded based on the default //= require_tree . in application.css, then the file must be named so that it precedes all other files alphabetically. If it's named bootstrap_loader.css.scss and I have an apples.css.scss file containing custom CSS, the CSS in apples.css.scss will be clobbered by bootstrap.\n\nI think that, in general, if you're using Sass w/Rails, it's better to have a `application.css.scss` file that uses `@import` to require exactly the files you want to load, or to explicitly define the files you want to load (using `//require x`), and in which order.\n\nHaving said that, the Readme isn't exactly clear wrt. require specifications. I'll see what I can cook up for 2.0.2.\n Fixed in 2.0.2\n  :(\n\nSorry man, if I had seen that you had made a start on the 2.0.1 conversion I wouldn't have done it. Thanks for putting the time in to do the conversion, but I think it's all sorted now though.\n  I didn't set !default on `$gridRowWidth` because at the time I didn't think it needed it - it's calculated from the three variables before it and I didn't think anyone would want to overwrite it.\n\nI'll add !default to it for the 2.0.1 release.\n  We have defined a [custom function named asset-url](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/compass_extensions.rb) for projects just using Compass which should _just work_, so this makes me think that it's Wordless rather than bootstrap-sass, perhaps it doesn't load extensions properly.\n\nI'm going to hang fire on merging this one and check out Wordless later to see how it handles Compass. Cheers.\n Hey @emzo, I see your pull request was merged into Wordless.\n\nDid that fix the issue?\n Presume fixed.\n  All on a mid-2010 Macbook Pro (2.4GHz Core 2 Duo)\n\nRails 3.1 app (with a reasonable set of additional stylesheets):\n\n```\ntom:qa tom$ time rake assets:precompile\n/Users/tom/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/ruby /Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/rake assets:precompile:all RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets\n/Users/tom/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/ruby /Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/rake assets:precompile:nondigest RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets\n\nreal    1m3.207s\nuser    0m34.134s\nsys 0m3.595s\n```\n\nAlmost fresh Rails 3.2 app:\n\n```\ntom:librarian tom$ time rake assets:precompile\n/Users/tom/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/ruby /Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/rake assets:precompile:all RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets\n\nreal    0m39.350s\nuser    0m21.538s\nsys 0m1.657s\n```\n\nI can't really reproduce the 3+ minutes you're seeing.\n Hey guys, sorry it's taken a while for me to sit down and get back to you all on this one, I've had the allure of much more pleasant tasks than profiling calling me.\n\nFrom browsing through previous issues, it looks like this issue will most likely lie within Sprockets, specifically the way it handles finding files. However, I can't be sure until I get chance to sit down with ruby-prof, it's particularly odd considering how fast reloading files is in development as opposed to production.\n\nWith Bootstrap 2.0.2 coming [soon](https://twitter.com/#!/TwBootstrap/status/178182968211279873) I intend to spend most of tomorrow going through the issues and getting everything in order with the Gem framework, before looking at the style changes. Hopefully I'll make some progress somewhere.\n So I created a new Rails 3.2.1 application, added RubyProf either side of [internal_precompile](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/sprockets/assets.rake#L33) and did two runs:\n\n```\nrake assets:precompile:primary\nrake assets:precompile\n```\n\nassets:precompile:primary runs by default in development environment since I didn't change the environment using RAILS_ENV. assets:precompile invokes assets:precompile:all with this command:\n\n```\n /Users/tom/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/ruby /Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/rake assets:precompile:all RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets\n```\n\nwhich in turn invokes assets:precompile:primary\n\nMy profiling runaround has led me to this piece of lovely code [here](https://github.com/nex3/sass/blob/master/lib/sass/tree/comment_node.rb#L72):\n\n``` ruby\ndef normalize_indentation(str)\n  pre = str.split(\"\\n\").inject(str[/^[ \\t]*/].split(\"\")) do |pre, line|\n    line[/^[ \\t]*/].split(\"\").zip(pre).inject([]) do |arr, (a, b)|\n      break arr if a != b\n      arr + [a]\n    end\n  end.join\n  str.gsub(/^#{pre}/, '')\nend\n```\n\nin which it would appear almost 100 seconds are spent in production, compared to < 1 in development. Naturally, this has left me wondering why, and I'm struggling to answer that.\n 37563aa, branch 2.0.2, give it a whirl.\n Right, I'm going to close this then. Cheers for all the help.\n  Yes.\n  The assets group makes the most sense, but I tend to just leave it ungrouped.\n\nOnce the files are included there's nothing else in the gem (helpers etc) which are needed, it's really a matter of personal preference wrt/Gemfile organisation, I guess.\n  This will go into the 2.0.1 release when I get the chance to look over those changes on the Bootstrap side, I guess we could do with a changelog floating around somewhere as well.\n Thanks.\n  @vala Okay, you need to import the mixins and variables _before_ importing the reset now since the reset depends on a mixin or two.\n I think you might have a SASS caching problem? All references to patterns should have been removed in this release.\n\nIn addition, if you're importing \"bootstrap\" you can remove all the other imports since bootstrap is a helper file that will import all the needed files. If you have any variable overrides just make sure you define them _before_ importing.\n  I think the require statement broke because of our move to the SASS partial underscore naming convention, so what was 'bootstrap' is now '_bootstrap'.\n\nYou should probably use `@import \"bootstrap\"` anyway since otherwise your stylesheets can't use any of the Bootstrap mixins or variables.\n  Ugh. :disappointed:\n\nI'm not sure namespacing is the best idea here since well, they perform the same thing just with different arguments. For me 0..1 is the most logical range for opacity to take, so 2.0.1 will probably ship with an opacity mixin that takes a value between 0 and 1.\n  I'm guessing you had a cached version of bootstrap/responsive compiled.\n\nThe last change that snuck in before I pushed the gem was bootstrap/responsive changing to bootstrap-responsive in response (har har) to some pathing errors.\n  norepro here, I've just got it working in my application.\n\nI would point out that the API changed slightly for dropdowns, but if it works when you directly include it then I'm not sure where the problem is.\n @barriault `twitter/bootstrap`? Are you pulling in an additional library? bootstrap-sass doesn't have anything namespaced under twitter. \n The Twitter components depend upon the presence of jQuery, although they shouldn't need the UJS helper.\n  There are still a couple of little changes to be made (moving bootstrap/responsive about and vendoring 1.4 so people using  rails_admin can upgrade) which, although minor, I haven't had the time to change _and_ test over the past week.\n Lets roll then.\n +1\n\n:shipit::octocat::snowman:\n\n:ok_hand:\n\n2.0 is on Rubygems now. Go get it, it's good.\n  Won't this break things? The responsive styles are in the same folder as the imports it's requiring.\n Nor do I pretend to understand it, it's a mythical beast at best, as I found out when I was first playing with overriding variables.\n\nEr yeah, I have it compiling fine in a Rails application as it is, although I haven't tried using Compass with responsive yet. I guess it might be for the best to move responsive up a level and rename it bootstrap-responsive or something similar anyway.\n Fixed in 86eadbe, thanks.\n  :shipit: Cheers.\n  I think this is, er, #28 rearing it's head again.\n\nI thought I had applied the fix that appeared to work since it wasn't an issue I could reproduce.\n\nAny chance of running with `--trace`?\n That shouldn't be in bootstrap-sass [any more](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/2.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss#L408), are you using the latest version of the 2.0 branch?\n  Yeah, I spent a good while playing around getting that to compile, so that's annoying.\n\nWhile that hack is cleaner and I'll pull it in, what error are/were you getting?\n #43 pulled in the upstream change, so I've merged that in rather than modify the hack. Cheers!\n  Since Bootstrap seems to be moving towards a three digit versioning system again with 2.0.1 soonish (rather than having a symbolic tiny version) this is probably what be doing, if needed. Hopefully it won't.\n  I'm reconverting the LESS source now, so yes, these will be included.\n  Progress is in [2.0](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/tree/2.0) branch. Release should be later today.\n  I think most of the prefixes are already in our 2.0 branch.\n\nBesides, I convert straight from the bootstrap LESS so any changes will be reflected in the gem.\n  We don't _need_ to use the underscore naming convention, `sass-rails` does not require it.\n\nIf you look at a compiled stylesheet that has compiled bootstrap-sass it should be a single stylesheet with all the components combined.\n\nWe are moving to the underscore naming system for compatibility with Compass, however.\n  Using a regexp to define the stylesheets you want precompiling feels bad to me, but yes, the files probably should have underscores if only to side with conventions.\n\nRegardless, I'm not planning to push an update to 1.4.x again, and 2.0 will follow the underscore convention.\n  I should hope that any lack of !important is a failing of Bootstrap rather than this conversion.\n\nCan you let me know if the issue still exists and I'll see if it's my doing or throw it up to the Bootstrap guys?\n  I added this back in 3792b55, cheers.\n  It has been compiling fine for me, what versions are you using? (aside from bootstrap-sass git)\n It's compiling fine for me in development, but I'll merge this in anyway, once I've pushed the latest set of changes out.\n\n``` css\n/* line 59, /Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.0.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/progress-bars.css.scss */\n.progress.striped .bar {\n  background-color: #62c462;\n  background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0 100%, 100% 0, color-stop(0.25, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)), color-stop(0.25, transparent), color-stop(0.5, transparent), color-stop(0.5, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)), color-stop(0.75, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)), color-stop(0.75, transparent), to(transparent));\n  background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(-45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent);\n  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(-45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent);\n  background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(-45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent);\n  background-image: -o-linear-gradient(-45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent);\n  background-image: linear-gradient(-45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent);\n  -webkit-background-size: 40px 40px;\n  -moz-background-size: 40px 40px;\n  -o-background-size: 40px 40px;\n  background-size: 40px 40px;\n}\n```\n  Will do. :+1:\n  because I hear that there's some people not using Rails, it would be cool if they can join in the fun.\n\nConsider this a ticket to track progress and such.\n @brentkirby Yeah, we'll make boostrap-sass either a rails/compass library, depending on which one we can load.\n\nI'll hold off pushing any of the Rails-specific stuff until we have conditional loading nailed down, want to make a start? I still have exams until this time next week so I can't commit to too much input this side of them.\n I think [this](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/compare/9f732e9...2.0-wip) is the set of changes.\n @brentkirby  We have [a week](http://www.markdotto.com/2012/01/24/bootstrap-2-ready-for-testing-and-feedback/) before Bootstrap 2.0 is released. My exams also finish tomorrow afternoon, so I've got a couple of days to hack on bootstrap-sass, but I don't want to duplicate any of your work if you have some stuff to push up and merge in. If you don't, I'll just plough on with this ticket tomorrow.\n The 2.0 branch now has support for either the Rails asset pipeline or Compass. I'm currently looking at what changes will be needed for an Rails application that also uses Compass, just looks like I'll need to set a couple of configuration variables.\n Consider this complete.\n  ![fun fun fun fun](http://cl.ly/0P2I0U0y363B1T003Y2G/content)\n\nI've just spent the last couple of hours updating my 2.0 branch to 2.0-wip head after reading [this](http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-bootstrap/browse_thread/thread/30773c6e3b41361d) thread on the twitter-bootstrap group. :sweat:\n\n---\n\nIn response to your points, I'd like to see bootstrap-sass moving towards _closer_ integration and coupling with Rails, rather than relying on an intermediary framework. I'd also rather not deviate too far from Bootstrap wherever possible, with the SCSS being as close to the original LESS where I can.\n\nIt seems that your aims with your conversion differ somewhat significantly, and I think it would change the direction in which bootstrap-sass is currently headed.\n\n---\n\n_As an aside, I'm fairly sure there are at least 100 forks of Bootstrap in a SASS form._\n I'll admit to knowing very little about cross-framework SASS - bootstrap-sass was originally created just as a way of experimentation, for me to get used to SASS and it's concepts. Outside of sass-rails and the Rails stack I've not really used SASS.\n\nSo, having said that, if bootstrap-sass is going to go cross-platform, I'm going to need a hand.\n\nWhat's the best way of setting sass stylesheets up for cross-platform use, will it fuck with the Rails asset pipeline and does it install a ton of extra dependencies? If we're going cross-platform I want the 'Rails experience' of 'drop it in your Gemfile and go' to still be intact since that was the original intention of the gem.\n\nAdding Rails-only features and helpers will still happen, I'll just have to conditionally require them, I guess.\n @brentkirby Thanks for that, I appreciate it. It's clear I'll need to do some reading and experimenting first. Hopefully it can be sorted out for Bootstrap 2.0 in 'a few weeks.'\n\n@oskarrough No, not really, it just means the Rails helpers and such will only get included if Rails is defined; other frameworks and such wouldn't know it existed. I'm only talking about simple helpers to simplify the somewhat verbose (in places) Bootstrap markup.\n Okay, so we'll move towards being framework agnostic.\n\nSince we have repurposed this ticket somewhat I think we should move the discussion about architecture etc. into #26.\n  While a solely-mixin powered Bootstrap would be interesting, I don't think it's something that I would merge back into this gem.\n\nAs I see it, Bootstrap is a tool to rapid development, and over time much of the Bootstrap _layout_ styling should be merged into your other SCSS files through the use of the mixins currently used to generate those 'rapid development' classes.\n\nFor other things, such as the growing design pattern library (buttons, pagination etc.) I see no problem with these remaining as classes.\n\nIf you were to convert Bootstrap to be entirely mixins, that changes the emphasis from rapid development to hand picking. You lose the benefit of being able to quickly use the grid since you have to consider in your CSS which column mixins you are including, rather than tweaking a couple of numbers inside your HTML classes. Although this is arguably a more considered approach, it's substantially different to what I feel Bootstrap should be: a rapid development tool.\n\nSo yes, I think it's interesting, but I don't think it will live as part of bootstrap-sass. Feel free to work as a fork of the project, however.\n  [This](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/829) seems to describe the same issue.\n  Lets take another stab at this, want to get 1.4 bug free so I can start developing against 2.0-wip.\n Found it. The initializer wasn't being compiled with the gem, since it is not part of the file declaration in the Gemspec.\n\n``` ruby\n  s.files = Dir[\"vendor/**/*.css.scss\"] + Dir[\"vendor/**/*.js\"] + [\"README.md\", \"LICENSE\", \"lib/bootstrap-sass.rb\", \"lib/bootstrap-sass/config/sass-ie_hex_str.rb\"]\n```\n\nDid the trick.\n Aside from that, it appears to be compiling fine now.\n uh-oh, what versions of things are you running?\n :+1:\n Can you try the 2.0.2 branch? The function was previously being defined twice, which _may_ have caused problems with Sass.\n  Did you solve this?\n  I imagine this will work straight with me merging it and pushing a new release right now but I'm tired, which means it's probably a really bad thing to do right this minute.\n\nI'll get to this first thing in the morning.\n @rjackson That's my understanding of it, I had to look up the exact definition myself. `~> 3.1.0` locks to 3.1.x, while `~> 3.1` locks to 3.x, where x > 1.\n  I'd be surprised, considering [these](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.2) are the changes between 1.4.0 and 1.4.2.\n\nIf you could provide some more information it would be useful, since I believe alerts have been working fine in my application since updating.\n  The files stay in the location the gem was installed in, and the containing folders are added to your Rails asset load path, meaning they are separate from your application.\n\nPerhaps the quickest way of discovering this would be to open up a Rails console and type the following:\n\n```\nRails.application.config.assets.paths\n```\n\nwhich will return an array of all the folders on your asset load path. This will then let you find the location of the bootstrap-sass gem - which, on my laptop, is in:\n\n```\n \"/Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/gems/bootstrap-sass-1.4.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets\"\n```\n\nWhat exactly is it that you are looking for from the source files?\n Aye, whatever works best for you.\n\nIt might be worth looking into issue #11 since it is a much better way to configure variables that will be included in 1.4.1. I'm hoping to push that out in the next 30 minutes, got to sync the javascripts & ensure there's no breaking styles. Will get the documentation updated as well.\n  Cheers man, I'll change it to be identical to the less line. Probably me trying to be clever when I was converting the code.\n\nSorry about not getting back to you on this one, exams in January are slowly drowning me already.\n Aye, I'm hoping to get a release tonight that addresses all the current issues.\n I think I've got this fixed now.\n _sigh_ thinking about it, this could either be the lack of quotes causing the issue, or the use of shorthand colours.\n\nLet me know if the 1.4.1 release has fixed it, if it's the shorthand colours I'll run round and change them and push 1.4.2.\n Give me an hour, go go go go go.\n filter doesn't support the use of named colours, only took me an hour to work it out. fun times. Guess I also have to figure out what's happening to the topbar as well but that's slightly less breaking than those buttons.\n\nWill try and push a new release with the fixes later today.\n That should do the trick, according to my Heroku sample application.\n\nLet me know though, I probably won't be able to push any more changes for the next few days (interview at Oxford) but, like I say, there shouldn't be a problem.\n Yeah, that was the problem I was having with the buttons, SASS will use a named colour representation or a shorthand notation if it can which MS-gradient won't accept.\n\nThe solution I had was to knock the blue value down a notch, which has next to no impact on the colour but makes it work. There doesn't seem to be no way of configuring what the default 'format' of the output is, which means we have to make the output in such a way that it can't be shorthanded, or to override it as you are doing. It's evil, but at the same time I see no obvious way around it.\n Consider this fixed. Finally.\n  Are you sure a leading 0 is required?\n\nsass-rails seems to be compiling it fine on my application:\n\n```\n/* line 951, /Users/tom/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/gems/bootstrap-sass-1.4.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/patterns.css.scss */\n.label {\n  padding: 1px 3px 2px;\n  font-size: 9.75px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n...\n```\n But the file is an SCSS file, rather than a ruby file, so it's not something that would be interpreted by ruby.\n\nAnyhow, it does increase readability so I'll probably merge it in anyway.\n  [This change here](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/e87daa907877e5727ae054e83dc2de55153e9358#lib/patterns.less)\n\nI'll fix it now.\n  Very cool.\n  This is why I need to keep hacking on my automagic converter.\n\nThanks.\n  Oop, I'll push 1.4.1 later today.\n  I can only presume that this is an issue with sass-rails, since bootstrap-sass doesn't alter the @import method.\n  It would be nice if bootstrap-sass had a series of Rails helpers that would make common tasks with bootstrap easier.\n\nOn the provisional list are:\n- Form helpers (no 1 priority really, cause bootstrap forms are a pain to markup)\n- Headings\n- Common structural blocks\n There are some good helpers out there already, gonna leave this one for 2.0.\n  We are not updated to the 1.4 release.\n Yeah, I'm hoping to get it done this afternoon, I'm just trying to work out the most efficient way of updating.\n CSS conversion is done, going to update the javascripts and push 1.4.0.\n go get her:\n\nhttps://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass\n  I'm not sure about merging this in yet, since I have been updating bootstrap-sass as new versions of Bootstrap have been released. Pulling in just the javascript changes now means that I'll have a master branch that has the CSS of 1.3.0 and the javascript of somewhere between 1.3.0 and a future HEAD.\n\nWhile I will update the javascripts to their latest versions when a new version of Bootstrap is released, pulling these changes now means I'll either have a project that's neither here nor there, or I'll have to keep up with Bootstrap's master branch. \n\nMy current approach to updates appears worked well so far, and I don't see myself attempting to keep up with Bootstrap master, so for now I would suggest you point Bundler at your own git repository and use that.\n The current version of bootstrap-sass has the CSS & JS from the v1.3.0 tag.\n\n[https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/v1.3.0](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/v1.3.0)\n Are these javascripts from the gh-pages branch, or master?\n\nIf they are from the gh-pages branch, then my apologies, I probably will merge them in. I was unaware that the publicly documented javascripts had changed - I thought there was just changes on master.\n\nBad form from Bootstrap's maintainers though - if you're going to tag a release, don't change the code after you've tagged it. :-1:\n Merged. I'll push out 1.3.2 in a few minutes.\n  I've been following that issue for some time and wondering what was up.\n\nI'll merge it in a second, and probably push a minor v. update later today, along with sorting #1 out. (I did really want to to follow Bootstrap's versioning, but it leaves me with so much inflexibility)\n Yeah, like I said, I'll break from Bootstraps versioning and push an update in the next few hours.\n I've just pushed 1.3.1 to Rubygems\n  Merged, thanks.\n  @grk's method for configuring variables in bootstrap-sass will be recommended in the new documentation site (when I get it finished).\n\nWhether it is with a generator or not is something I still haven't decided.\n", "text_all_count": 19858, "text_word_token": ["Closing", "due", "to", "LINK", "The", "error", "be", "come",

It was creating a duplicate bootstrap.css file on compile.\n\nBefore:\n![redundant-bootstrap-scss-file](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3138019/3946069/4d6ece14-265f-11e4-9826-cc9a97e8318e.png)\n\nAfter:\n![redundant-bootstrap-scss-file-removed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3138019/3946071/56f076e0-265f-11e4-90c6-9dd9191352e3.png)\n I'm wondering if renaming it to `_bootstrap.scss` might be safer. That way it wouldn't break existing imports that might be using the sheet. \n The files are line-by-line identical and compile identically. I am not having any issues locally after removing the duplicated file.\n\n![identical-files](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3138019/3946592/b4c89002-2675-11e4-8ab8-a6f00f336f57.png)\n  I am using bower for install the dependency of bootstrap.\n\n**_.bowerrc**_\n\n``` json\n {\n   \"directory\": \"vendor/assets/components\"\n }\n```\n\n**_add components folder**_ to the asset pipeline\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.assets.paths << Rails.root.join('vendor', 'assets', 'components')\n```\n\n**_require**_ the bootstrap dependency \n\n``` css\n*= require bootstrap-sass-official\n```\n\nThe problem is in [_glyphicons](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_glyphicons.scss#L1) file the lines where we specify the dependency with the font files I need to change it to because it's giving me error.\n\n``` scss\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap-sass-official/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap-sass-official/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap-sass-official/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap-sass-official/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n```\n\nI don't like the idea of go to the bower files and change it, that's pretty bad in my opinion. What can I do? for fix this problem\n @glebm can you help me with this please?\n yes I am looking for something like improve the sprockets I don't want to add the bootstrap font path to my assets or something related to that.\nI going to change the _glyphicons then and put the relative path. Thank very much @glebm \n @glebm why did you revert the commit?\n Please try out the lastest `next` branch, see [the commit](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/fe4aaa4b8a98e8b2f32f2d2e7f1c616d68417087) for details.\n To do: add Readme section on using the Bower package with Rails.\n This issue also affects middleman (and I imagine anything else that uses sprockets).\n\nI had to similarly tell sprockets about the font load path. In my case I wanted to load all the fonts so I have a little bit of  heavy-handed loading going on here in `config.rb`\n\n``` ruby\nafter_configuration do\n  @bower_config = JSON.parse(IO.read(\"#{root}/.bowerrc\"))\n  Dir.glob(File.join(\"#{root}\", @bower_config[\"directory\"], \"**/*\", \"fonts\")) do |f|\n    sprockets.append_path f\n  end\n  sprockets.append_path File.join \"#{root}\", @bower_config[\"directory\"]\nend\n```\n\nThis appears to work for me.\n  close #684\n See discussion in #605\n  I am using grunt-contrib-sass 0.7.3 and am trying to compile bootstrap 3.2.0.  \n\nI am getting the following error.\n\n```\nFile ../../webcontent/cs/css/ss-standard.css created.\nSyntax error: 5%*rem/px isn't a valid CSS value.\n        on line 80 of ../../webcontent/cs/bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_type.scss\n        from line 12 of ../../webcontent/cs/bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss\n        from line 19 of ../../webcontent/cs/scss/bootstrap.scss\n```\n\nHere is the sass portion of my grunt config.  \n\n``` json\n    sass : {\n      dist : {\n        files : [{\n          expand : true,\n          cwd : '<%= webcontentPath %>/scss',\n          src : '**/*.scss',\n          dest : '<%= distPath %>/css',\n          ext : '.css'\n        }],\n        options : {\n          style : 'compact',\n          precision: 10\n        }\n      }\n```\n  The assets are in /assets, but they should be in /vendor/assets for rails 4 (see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html under \"2.2 Asset Organization\"). Also, on http://getbootstrap.com/css/#sass it says it should reside there. The old location creates error messages in IDEs like RubyMine.\n Hi @ri4a, I followed you here from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24646244/cannot-resolve-file-in-rubymine).\n\nI did some research on this, looks like `vendor/assets` are moved to `assets` on purpose when closing issue #535 \n\nI manually added a symbolic link in the gem installation of my development work environment, just to clear to error messages in RubyMine, it works fine.\n\n```\n2.1.0/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.2.0.0% ls -l vendor\ntotal 8\nlrwxr-xr-x  1 gogao  staff  9 Aug  7 11:28 assets -> ../assets\n```\n\nSince the rails application runs fine with or without this (only RubyMine editor complains about this), I am not sure whether the maintainer will merge my pull request or not.\n @glebm Thanks for your explanation! I agree it is more a RubyMine bug rather than a bootstrap-sass one. Glad to know there is already an open issue on their tracker.\n  the line '@import \"bootstrap\" is causing me to receive the following error:\n![screen shot 2014-08-02 at 5 52 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2034140/3789202/f96ef5dc-1a92-11e4-92ab-8a58fdfc9ac8.png)\n\nBut if I comment out that line, it works. Am I missing something?\n Well, that's my question too? I don't understand why its only getting the error when I setup bootstrap-sass.\n Complete fluke. After some re-setting-up the repo on my mac, doing all the bundle installs and db migrations, it's back to working. Sorry for the confusion.\n  i installed bootstrap-sass-official using bower and made one carousel bootstrap, the control icons were rectangular blocks.\nthen i tried to using various glyphicons icons and none of them is working\n +1\n Having the same issue, unable to fix it.\n I also having the same issue. When I checked compiled `styles.css` file found wrong font path in font-face\n\nIt is adding `styleshets` directory. However, this is not needed since `fonts` directory is in that. When I tried to change fonts path in variable file but than couldn't find how to change.\n\n**Compiled code:**\n\n``` css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot);\n  src: url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix) format(\"embedded-opentype\"), url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff) format(\"woff\"), url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf) format(\"truetype\"), url(/stylesheets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular) format(\"svg\");\n}\n```\n\nAny idea?\n Add following lines to Brocfile.js-->\napp.import('vendor/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js');\napp.import('vendor/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss');\nthen\nhttp://www.octolabs.com/blogs/octoblog/2014/05/25/bootstrap-glyphicons-with-ember-cli/\n\nit will start working\n  I have a problem with upgrading bootstrap-sass from 3.0 to 3.2, I don't use rails (it's just a static project, I use middleman)\n\nImport from my `scss` file:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nCommand:\n\n``` bash\n$ middleman build --verbose\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\nFile to import not found or unreadable: mixins/hide-text.\nLoad paths:\n  /media/ubuntu/697acfb6-f29d-4b6c-a95c-ae2d764dc47f/var/www/wordpress/wp-content/themes/refresh/source/stylesheets\n  /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/compass-core-1.0.0.alpha.21/stylesheets\n  /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/modular-scale-2.0.5/stylesheets\n  /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/omg-text-0.0.2/stylesheets\n  /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/sassy-maps-0.4.0/sass\n  /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/breakpoint-2.4.5/stylesheets\n  /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/compass-recipes-0.3.0/stylesheets\n/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.2.0.0/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss:5\n/var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.2.0.0/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss:3\n```\n\nBefore upgrading everything worked fine. What should I do now?\n Well, I have latest sprockets.

The problem is in sprockets-sass. Middleman-sprockets for some reason used an old sprockets-sass 1.1.0 instead of new 1.2.0. So I deleted the old version and now everything works like a charm!

I noticed other files in this directory have a sass suffix.\n\nMy testing shows that if there is already a `application.css` in `app/assets/stylesheets`, then you put `application.css.scss` to the same folder will not work.\n\nThanks.\n Yes, I suppose it is a typo, the correct place is inside the `stylesheets`.\n\nThe suffix is correct, `*.css.scss` and in my case I don't have any `.sass`, maybe a gem you're using?\n\nAbout your tests, you can't have two files named `application`, you should use something else like `custom.css.scss` or anything that makes more sense to you and your project.\n\nI'm new to all this so I hope I may have added something :)\n  Hi, when I try to do this?\nbundle exec compass create gusnewBootStrap  -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\n\nthis is the answer my terminal gets for me:\n\nLoadError on line [\"161\"] of /Users/gustavoduenas/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p481/gems/compass-0.12.7/lib/compass/configuration/data.rb: cannot load such file -- bootstrap-sass\nRun with --trace to see the full backtrace\n\nsomeone would please let me know how to make this to work?\n\nThanks for your help to this bootstrap aficionado.\n\nI'm running mac osx mavericks.\n Can we get your sass/bootstrap-sass version info?\n Thanks man I did fix it that way.....thanks again\nOn Jul 28, 2014 7:47 PM, \"Gleb Mazovetskiy\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I tried the above commands with compass 0.2.17 and bootstrap-sass 3.2.0.0,\n> it works (there are tests for this command as well).

 I found similar Bootstrap Sass 3.2 glyphicon issues, but these pertained to the Ruby or Rails version installs. Here is the issue I am having with the Compass only install, after running these lines\n\n$ gem install bootstrap-sass\n$ compass create MyProject -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\n\nWithin sass/_bootstrap-variables.scss I updated the $icon-font-path variable (line 78) testing both relative paths and absolute paths to my glyphicon font files (located in /css/fonts/bootstrap/). Neither relative or absolute, worked.\n\nAfter looking at the processed style.css file i noticed that @font-face was being structured like this:\n\n``` css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: url(url(/css/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot));\n  src: url(url(/css/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix)) format(\"embedded-opentype\"), url(url(/css/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff)) format(\"woff\"), url(url(/css/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf)) format(\"truetype\"), url(url(/css/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular)) format(\"svg\");\n}\n```\n\nNotice the extra \"url(\" in each src: call. I have no idea what is causing this as i am not including it as part of the $icon-font-path. I am using grunt-contrib-compass but have not changed my Gruntfile.js, and glyphicons worked in v3.1 of bootstrap-sass.\n\nFor further reference:\n**My config.rb file**\n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'bootstrap-sass'\nhttp_path = \"/\"\ncss_dir = \"css\"\nsass_dir = \"sass\"\nimages_dir = \"images\"\njavascripts_dir = \"javascripts\"\n```\n\n**My styles.scss file**\n\n``` sass\n@import \"bootstrap-compass\";\n@import \"bootstrap-variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nAnd just because I was trying several things, i added @import \"bootstrap-sprockets\" and when doing this, instead of an extra \"url(\" being added, \"font-path(\" is added e.g.: src: url(font-path(/css/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot));\n\nI can fix this issue temporarily by editing the styles.css file to remove the extra \"url(\" from each @font-face src call, but when Grunt runs again, this is added back in.\n\nPlease let me know if I am just doing something wrong or if this is a deeper issue.\n**Thank you!**\n Thank you for the reply, @glebm. I am using compass (0.12.6). I am still new to compass and sass, so im not really sure what this means: \"> cat tmp/new-compass-project/stylesheets/styles.css | grep url\" Do I need to add this to my css file?\n That definitely helps @glebm, and you're right that changing the path to something like `bootstrap/` keeps the extra \"url(\" from being added.\n  The convert script doesn't work if passed a SHA from Bootstrap 2.\n  A rails 4.1.4 app (created a fresh one to demonstrate in isolation). \n\nbootstrap-sass 3.2.0.0\n\nFollowed 3.2.0.0 instructions to include bootstrap-sprockets in my .scss:\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nStill, when I precompile assets and load the app in RAILS_ENV=production, all my glyphicons references result in white boxes (unknown glyph) on screen, instead of the proper glyph. \n\nExploring further... I see my browser is asking for:\n    Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) \n    http://localhost:3000/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\n\n```\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) \nhttp://localhost:3000/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\n```\n\nWhat _would_ have worked was:   \n\n```\n http://localhost:3000/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-370498439f583aabf7e5fa44b046cb1b.ttf\n```\n\nConfirmed that URL resolves in my app. Recent versions of Rails only generate assets with the hash stamp on the end, it doesn't generate versions un-stamped. \n\nIt looks like bootstrap-sass is supposed to accomodate this, that's what the new `bootstrap-sprockets` file is supposed to do?  And the [sass that references](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_glyphicons.scss#L17)  , with the:\n\n```\nif($bootstrap-sass-asset-helper, twbs-font-path ....\n```\n\n For some reason it's not working. Is `$bootstrap-sass-asset-helper` ever actually defined to trigger that `if`?  I'm having trouble figuring out what the intention is here. \n As I try to debug/workaround further, I'm getting very confused, but it seems possible it's a Rails bug too. Lots of moving parts here.  \n > Is config.assets.digest = true set to true in config/environments/production.rb?\n\nYep. \n\nOkay, I can't explain what's going on or how I figured it out, but the trick is that you need to precompile your Rails assets like:\n\n```\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile\n```\n\nIt's important to explicitly set the \"RAILS_ENV=production\" when you precompile.  I am not sure if this is a bug in Rails or not -- this stuff keeps changing in Rails, and I have trouble keeping track of it. I kind of thought precompile was supposed to default to the production environment, or something -- however, I see now that the current [Rails Assets Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#precompiling-assets) does indeed instruct you to do \"RAILS_ENV=production\" before the asset precompile. \n\nI'm in the process of upgrading an app to Rails4, so I guess I missed that memo. \n\nSo I guess everything's working?  If other people report this, the `RAILS_ENV=production` tip might be the trick. \n This should be pinned, or bookmarked, or included in the readme. I spent many hours trying to figure this out.\n\n```\nRAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile\n```\n\nThis worked for me\n  Update the $icon-font-path to match the [default](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.2.0/less/variables.less#L76) in twbs/bootstrap, per #650.\n Thank you!\n  See http://www.sache.in\nFoundation is listed in it, so I figure perhaps we ought to be too?\n  Is there a current scaffolding generator? If not, can we have a scaffolding generator?\n  Ok here is the issue:\nThe Rails 4.1.2 app is looking in:\n`/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff`\nyet asset in production is called:\n`/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-{hash}.woff`\n**The request is missing the ~hash~ part.**\n\nPut the fonts in my assets/fonts directory && overwrote the application.css.scss (actually custom.css.scss) file to this:\n\n``` scss\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n\n/* Import the fonts */\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: font-url('glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot');\n  src: font-url('glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\n       font-url('glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff') format('woff'),\n       font-url('glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf') format('truetype'),\n       font-url('glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular') format('svg');\n}\n```\n\nNow it looks for them in: \n`/assets/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff`\nbut still no hash is being appended to the name. \n\nApplication.rb has this line:\n\n``` ruby\n  # For Bootstrap Sass\n    config.assets.precompile = config.assets.precompile + %w(*.png *.jpg *.jpeg *.gif *.woff *.ttf *.svg *.eot)\n```\n\nThis problem occured with the upgrade from bootstrap-sass from 3.1.1.1 to 3.2.0.0\n Yes `config.assets.digest = true` in production.rb. I do a precompile in development since I do a war-file deploy to tomcat. I'll do a `rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production` and see if that fixes it. Though I doubt it as the files are precompiled, just rails requests the fonts without the hash, which don't exist. Other files like css and js and images all are requested with appropriate hashes appended.\n\nThanks I'll remove the line from application.rb once this issue is resolved. \n doing a `rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production` raises this error:\n\n```\nSass::SyntaxError: Undefined variable: \"$alert-padding\".\n  (in /Users/username/.rvm/gems/jruby-1.7.13/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.2.0.0/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_alerts.scss:10)\n```\n I have the exact same problem as @rebelwarrior - I upgraded to bootstrap-sass 3.2.0.0 and since then the Glyphicons are gone in production (where I'm precompiling the assets during deployment). I'll try to look into this issue to find out what has changed between 3.1.x and 3.2.x.\n in your application.scss:\n\n@import 'bootstrap-sprockets';\n@import 'bootstrap';\n\n(be sure to first import bootstrap-sprockets)\n\nsee Changelog and Readme ;)\n I'm ashamed... Thanks @erpe! I only read the Bootstrap changelog, but not the one from the bootstrap-sass gem. This solved the problem for me. But @rebelwarrior did this, so he might have another issue.\n My project is open-source you can see it at: [Rukh](https://github.com/commonwealth-of-puerto-rico/rukh)\n Had a similar issue as @erpe. When adding the @imports Make sure you have an application.css.scss, not just application.css or obviously your imports don't work, and your glyphicons don't work. Derp.\n I'm also experiencing this problem. Here are the facts:\n- renamed `application.css` to `application.css.scss`\n- added the following to `application.css.scss`:\n\n```\n     @import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";\n     @import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n- have `config.assets.digest = true` in `production.rb`\n- assets are successfully **precompiled with** a digest suffix in production\n- but: glyphicon/font-assets (only) are **requested without** the digest suffix in production\n- using rails 4.1.5, sprockets-rails 2.1.3 and bootstrap-sass 3.2.0.1\n\nShall we reopen this issue?\n I solved my original problem yesterday with a hack. Because I am using warble/tomcat/jruby stack putting the override code in a scss was failing, that's why while it was looking for it with the hash necessary it was looking for it in the wrong path. \n\nSo I added this partial (_glyphicons.html.haml) to my haml layout:\n\n``` haml\n:css\n  @font-face { font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';   \n  src: url(#{asset_path 'glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot'});   \n  src: url(#{asset_path 'glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix'}) format('embedded-opentype'), \n  url(#{asset_path 'glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff'}) format('woff'),  \n  url(#{asset_path 'glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf'}) format('truetype'), \n  url(#{asset_path 'glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons-halflingsregular'}) format('svg'); } \n```\n\nThen I put the fonts in a directory in assets like I say above and changed the config settings (as on previous posts) so it gets precompiled as an asset. \n\nThis hack allowed it load no problem. And I figured the reason it was failing inside the scss file was that when it compiles the assets (in my dev machine) there is no tomcat container so it assumes there isn't one, while putting it in a haml file allows it to be dynamically generated from the .war file'd application running in tomcat.\n\nThere is a bug from a change in the bootstrap gem that changes the way the fonts are fetched. I've no hit upon what's causing it. But I am suspecting that it has to do with `@import` settings somewhere. However, my original problem was to why the _override_ wasn't working when it should. \n\nOne of the recommendations I got was to precompile from the production environment which would not have an effect on my override since the problem was due to when the code was being executed. However, this command: `RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile --trace` gives me this error: \n\n``` bash\nrake aborted!\nSass::SyntaxError: Undefined variable: \"$alert-padding\".\n```\n Update on the [above](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/653#issuecomment-53718033):\n- I generated a new simple Rails 4.1 app\n  - I can't reproduce it locally with WEBRick but I had to set `config.serve_static_assets = true` in `production.rb` which could skew testing\n  - I can reproduce it when deployed on OpenShift\n\nWill try to bisect the problem on OpenShift...\n So, I downgraded bootstrap-sass to v3.1.0 but the issue still persists on OpenShift. I guess this warrants a new issue then...\n  Is there some way to get the SASS grid files only (i.e. without the rest of Bootstrap)?\n Thanks!\n Sorry, just want to ask - but can you also import the BS JS separately? \n\nI.e. //= require bootstrap/dropdown ?\n  Hello,\n\nI am sorry if this is a misunderstanding on my side but is there any reason why the default path for the icon-font is specified as\n\n```\n//** Load fonts from this directory.\n$icon-font-path: \"bootstrap/\" !default;\n```\n\nand not \n\n```\n$icon-font-path: \"../fonts/bootstrap/\" !default;\n```\n\nWhen I compile the bootstrap.scss with sass and include the css in my html via\n\n```\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bootstrap-sass-twbs/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">\n```\n\nthe glyphicons (which reside in bootstrap-sass-twbs/assets/fonts/bootstrap) are consequently **not** referenced by the bootstrap.css correctly as the output looks like this:\n\n```\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: url(\"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\");\n  ...\n```\n\nand not like this\n\n```\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: url(\"../fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\");\n  ...\n```\n\nUsing the compiled distribution version of bootstrap, the css references the fonts in a correct relative way (`../fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot`) and looking at the less code in https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/less/variables.less the variable is set to `@icon-font-path: \"../fonts/\"`\n\nSo shouldn't the sass ported version not also be set to something like `../fonts/bootstrap/`?\n\nThanks\n @felixhayashi is correct that the less code in twbs/bootstrap [has the default value](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.2.0/less/variables.less#L76) `@icon-font-path: \"../fonts/\";`.\n\nThe current default here at bootstrap-sass, `\"bootstrap/\"`, fails to work out-of-the-box when you use Sass. There are ways around this issue, for instance, use Compass instead of Sass:\n1) Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#b-compass-without-rails) to get started with installing Compass. Make sure you're using the latest version of Compass.\n2) Go into config.rb, and uncomment the following line (included by default if you start a new Compass project per the instructions at the link above):\n\n``` ruby\n# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:\n# relative_assets = true\n```\n\n3) Make sure you're importing bootstrap-compass [per these instructions](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#fonts).\n\nYet it would definitely make more sense to have this work correctly in Sass out-of-the-box, without needing to rely on Compass's URL helpers. Pull request #662 fixes this!\n  I recently upgraded to version 3.2.0 on a project that uses the asset pipeline.  Everything is fine in development, but when I deploy to production I'm seeing 404s on the font URLs.\n\nI had to put a workaround into the system (switched to Font Awesome icons), so I don't have the exact URLs handy, but the four missing font URLs all started with '/assets' and did not contain a hash.\n\nI did a full precompile on deploy.  Is there anything additional I need to do on my end?  Or is this a bug?\n\nThanks.\n I'm getting the same thing on my Heroku deploys, having just updated to Rails 4.1.2 and Bootstrap 3.2.0.  I followed the instructions in the Readme.md about including bootstrap-sockets (which I didn't do before when using 3.1.1.1), and now things are working fine in local development but not on Staging in Heroku...even if I run a rake assets:precompile in that environment.\n Yep, seeing the same thing here, as well.  Also on Heroku, Rails 4.1.2.  Works fine in development, though.  Downgrading to 3.1.1.1 fixed the issue.\n Thanks.  I didn't have `@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";` in application.css.scss.  That fixed the issue.  Is that new for this version?  It's unfortunate that the glyphicons don't fail in development without this line. \n @glebm Yes, this is a Rails 4.1.2 application.\n\nI didn't have the `@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"`.  I'm going to add that and see if it resolves the issue.\n @glebm That fixed it.  Thanks for the quick response.\n\nMay I recommend a more prominent 'Upgrading' section for the README?  I looked at the README before doing the upgrade, but as I didn't see such a section (and the info was a little buried in the release notes) I didn't realize anything needed to change with the upgrade.\n I've also seen an increasing number of gems printing out post-installation notes for important reminders like this.  It's really helpful.\n I'm sorry to comment here but I'm still having issues with importing the font URLs. They all start with '/assets' but do not contain a hash. I'm running rails 4.0.5, bootstrap-sass 3.2.0 and sass-rails 4.0.3, and have:\n\nIn application.css.scss\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\", \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nIn application.js.coffee\n\n```\n#= require jquery\n#= require bootstrap-sprockets\n```\n\nIn config/environments/production.rb\n\n```\nconfig.assets.digest = true\n```\n\nAnd I've ran\n\n```\nRAILS_ENV=production bin/rake assets:precompile\n```\n Tried, didn't work.\n\nThe assets for glyphicons are being compiled properly:\n\n```\n/releases/20140704212535/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-5b45b1b7e2e21c6fc68baba04c598c1b.eot\n/releases/20140704212535/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-162bf559e9a471421aecb54a8e26a41f.svg\n/releases/20140704212535/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-47f0fa2e94db0db9253e35f18a810f9e.ttf\n/releases/20140704212535/public/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-8a4a4c0432ca57f6d4d8ce58b9505fc0.woff\n```\n\nBut the URL's created don't include the hash.\n\n```\nRequest URL:https://d1nbipydautb8m.cloudfront.net/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\n```\n I realized I was importing \"bootstrap\" in another file which was being loaded before \"bootstrap-sprockets\".

Many thanks!\n Thanks for both the gem update and the response, @glebm !\n  I'm finding the compass work flow in the README for \"Compass without Rails\" to be too incomplete to be useful; I've spent a couple days trying to get a working bootstrap install out of the instructions:\n\n> or, alternatively, if you're not using a Gemfile for your dependencies:\n> \n>  <pre>compass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap</pre>\n\nThis, alone, does not come close to creating a usable install.  Dependencies like jquery aren't brought down.  Even bootstrap.js <em>is not present.</em>\n\nThere is hopefully a tutorial, somewhere, that goes through the whole install process, and gives some idea how a file like index.html might reference the needed pieces to actually do something useful.\n\nAre the instructions in the readme even correct?  If they are, what would it take to make these instructions complete enough to actually be useful to someone new to bootstrap?\n\nsass I've done.  But doing it with bootstrap looks pretty unsupported for being supported :-)\n\nWho maintains this?  Am I even posting this in the right place?\n As a cross reference, to see what's in the bootstrap-3.1.1.zip download vs. the bootstrap-sass-3.1.1.tar.gz download, I used the tutorial at http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-fixed-layout.php (the Jumbotron-based example towards the bottom of the page).  I unzipped the zip archive, renamed it to bootstrap/,  and adapted the Jumbotron example from the page by changing the links to the css files.  The following links <em>work</em> for the standard source release:\n\n```\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIf I do this, I see the CSS applied both for elements and for layout.\n\nNow, if I expand the bootstrap-sass.tar.gz archive, and swap its contents for bootstrap/, <em>nothing works</em>.  The file hierarchy is completely different (not documented), and the files themselves aren't similar.  For example, bootstrap.js in the original archive is a real javascript file.  The bootstrap-sass version, in vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js, is:\n\n```\n//= require bootstrap/affix\n//= require bootstrap/alert\n//= require bootstrap/button\n//= require bootstrap/carousel\n//= require bootstrap/collapse\n//= require bootstrap/dropdown\n//= require bootstrap/tab\n//= require bootstrap/transition\n//= require bootstrap/scrollspy\n//= require bootstrap/modal\n//= require bootstrap/tooltip\n//= require bootstrap/popover\n```\n\nwhich looks like something that needs to be preprocessed (or just wrong).\n\nThe README needs to explain what to do with bootstrap-sass.tar.gz.  And in addition, someone really needs to test the procedures described in the current README.md to make sure they actually work.  They might.  But not without more steps than what are listed in the README.\n Yes, I guess you're in the right place to discuss this. But I'm afraid you're probably the best person to fix the shortcoming. There's few value in complaining.\n\nConsider this: I've added the _\"or, alternatively, ...\"_ paragraph to the README, because I found this missing. Probably similar to you, I had struggled before getting Bootstrap and Compass work together. I'm using bootstrap-sass and compass in a [Django app](https://github.com/bittner/django-organice-theme/blob/develop/organice_theme/static/config.rb) (no ruby, no gemfile).\n\nIf you think the dependencies like jQuery etc. are necessary to be mentioned again (apart from this being explained on the [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#whats-included)), add it. It may be just logical for many, but worth for beginners.\n I can only fix it if I can make it work.  I still can't.\n\nIf you can describe what you did to get it working -- step by step -- it will help.  My sense is that if you have it working, you may not be working from the same set of instructions.  There are <em>a lot</em> of different recipes out there (using bower, using compass, downloading archives, and so on).  They are all different.  So don't assume you looked in the same places I did.\n\nRight now, the archive as it is on the website <em>cannot work</em> -- its contents are clearly wrong.  So there's a missing build process, or the process used to build the tar ball on the getbootstrap web site is just wrong.  I can't tell which.\n\nHow did you get it working?\n\nThanks,\nRob\n\nRob Thorne\nTorenware Networks\n @bittner -- the Bootstrap link is for version 2.3, which turns out to be pretty different as far as how it is built.\n\nHow did you build bootstrap-sass for Django?  Did you download the archives, or did you use compass and other tools to download dependencies.\n\nI'm aware of the jquery dependency, but if you look at the example tutorial I pointed to, that won't be an issue, since I use a CDN copy of jquery 2.0.  Which works.  The problem appears to be with the archive itself, which is either incomplete, or needs some additional build step before it is valid for use.\n I think all I did is\n1. execute the command in the _\"alternatively, ...\"_ paragraph, and\n2. adapt the `config.rb` file that is generated by that command (see my [config.rb](https://github.com/bittner/django-organice-theme/blob/develop/organice_theme/static/config.rb))\n\nOf course, jQuery is in the `js` subfolder, and the glyphicons are in the `css/fonts/bootstrap` subfolder. I'm pretty sure I copied this over. Though, I think that's the only manual thing I did. I have a neat `Makefile` that takes care of updating to the latest `compass` and `bootstrap-sass` version on my Ubuntu system (see my [Makefile](https://github.com/bittner/django-organice-theme/blob/develop/Makefile)). This is only needed on the development machine as compass will generate a final, single `css/styles.css` file for the resulting project in the end.\n\nI'm also using `uglify-js` in my hand-crafted asset pipline.

I knew I was missing something. Thanks!\n  Original `less` bootstrap 3.1.1:\n\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.1.1/less/forms.less#L191-L202\n\n``` less\n.radio,\n.checkbox {\n  display: block;\n  min-height: @line-height-computed; // clear the floating input if there is no label text\n  margin-top: 10px;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n  padding-left: 20px;\n  label {\n    display: inline;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    cursor: pointer;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nbootstrap sass 3.1.1+2\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/v3.1.1%2B2/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_forms.scss#L207-L220\n\n``` scss\n.radio,\n.checkbox {\n  display: block;\n  min-height: $line-height-computed; // clear the floating input if there is no label text\n  margin-top: 10px;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n\n  label {\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    cursor: pointer;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that in original bootstrap, there is a `padding-left: 20px` applying to `.radio, .checkbox`.  But in bootstrap-sass, that padding-left has been moved down to apply only to the inner `label`, to apply to a label inside a `.radio` or `.checkbox`, instead of to any `.radio, .checkbox`.  And there are other differences as well in the `label` definition. \n\nI am getting improper display of bootstrap checkboxes in my app, I tracked it down to this. \n\nNow, I notice that bootstrap-sass 3.1.1 _does_ seem to match.  I can't figure out what the `+2` means. I would have thought it meant bugfixes relevant only to `bootstrap-sass` -- but in this case, it seems to be changes that aren't bugfixes, and may be the opposite. \n\nThe current 3.1.1+1 and 3.1.1+2 (I am actually using rubygem 3.1.1.1) is not working right for me, checkboxes are in some cases displaying wrong, and I have tracked it down to this discrepency. \n\nPlease advise! Thanks! \n Okay, thanks. \n\nDoes `boostrap-sass v3.1.1+1` correspond to any release of canonical `bootstrap`?  Or it contains a snapshot of the CSS taken directly from git that does not actually correspond to any release of the original bootstrap?  I expected that `bootstrap-sass` releases would track original `bootstrap` releases, and that the `+1` and `+2` releases would just have infrastructural bugfixes, not a new otherwise-unreleased repo snapshots. \n\nThe reason why I ask is because I believe I am encountering a CSS bug in `bootstrap-sass v3.1.1+1` -- checkboxes constructed according to the bootstrap examples don't actually display, in some circumstances,in `v3.1.1+1` like they do in `v3.1.1`. \n\nBut it is confusing to figure out exactly what's going on, I may be wrong.  I'm getting confused figuring out how to isolate a reproduction to verify, and/or report this, getting confusing about what version of `bootstrap-sass` is supposed to correspond to CSS or docs for what version of original `bootstrap`. \n Or, here's another way to put it:\n\nI am having trouble writing CSS that works with both bootstrap-sass gem releases `3.1.1.0` and `3.1.1.1`.  The bootstrap CSS changes between the two are enough that for my HTML DOM, with bootstrap classes being used, it displays differently between the two versions. \n\nMy code is in a Rails engine gem itself, and I'd like it to work with both 3.1.1.0 and 3.1.1.1 (or really any `v3.1.x` as the developer using the gem could be using the version of their choice. But this is challenging now, and I'm not sure if it should be considered a bug or not?\n\nCanoical bootstrap says it uses [semantic versioning](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k1oqq0ju8mbryma/Screenshot%202014-06-13%2008.47.27.png).  That doesn't cover the extra fourth versioning numeral you are using here; is there any policy for that?  The changes are significant enough that I'd expect if they had been in a original bootstrap release, they seem too big for even just incrementing the third numeral to  3.1.2 under semantic versioning -- they don't seem to be simple bugfixes.  \n\nBut rather than wait for a 3.1.2 or 3.2.0 or whatever future version of original `bootstrap` they will be contained in, `bootstrap-sass` has released them in a `3.1.1.1`.  Was this a mistake, did you not mean to update bootstrap source in this micro-level release?  (Mistakes happen). Or do you have a different versioning policy than original bootstrap?  \n\nI'm trying to figure out the right course of action on my end, depending on what is intended by you. \n Gleb, if as you say 3.1.1.1 and 3.1.1.2 contain updates/bug fixes from\nbootstrap master not yet in an official upstream release, I think that's\nincorrect.\n\nOur x.y.z should correspond exactly to upstream x.y.z releases, with the\n4th sub-version used only for fixes to the sass translation of the\nupstream to bring it closer to a correct match with the released version,\nor to bug fixes within our independent auxiliary codebase.\n\nCan you confirm this is the release model and that this change did not come\nfrom a pre-release upstream master? If so, no worries, we should just make\nsure not to do this in the future :)\n\nOn Friday, June 13, 2014, Jonathan Rochkind notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Or, here's another way to put it:\n> \n> I am having trouble writing CSS that works with both bootstrap-sass gem\n> releases 3.1.1.0 and 3.1.1.1.

It's also hard because I generally lean heavily on the bootstrap documentation and it's examples to understand the 'right' way to do something, but the current latest bootstrap documentation for latest bootstrap release may in some places not correspond to 3.1.1+2. \n\nBut okay, I understand the terrain now at least. Definitely appreciate greatly that in the future you will keep bootstrap-sass releases corresponding to appropriate original bootstrap releases. \n Thanks!\n  I'm using the Ember App Kit (https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit). \nI've added grunt-sass as a devDependency:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev grunt-sass\n```\n\nI've added bootstrap with:\n\n```\nbower install --save bootstrap-sass-official\n```\n\nWhich shows:\n\n```\nbower bootstrap-sass-official#* cached git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#3.1.1+2\nbower bootstrap-sass-official#*         validate 3.1.1+2 against git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#*\n\nUnable to find a suitable version for bootstrap-sass-official, please choose one:\n    1) bootstrap-sass-official#~3.1.1+2 which resolved to 3.1.1+2 and is required by ember-app-kit\n    2) bootstrap-sass-official#~3.1.1+2 which resolved to 3.1.1+2\n\nPrefix the choice with ! to persist it to bower.json\n\n\n[?] Answer: !1\n```\n\nI changed my app.css to app.scss and imported bootstrap (the folder structure seems odd)\n\n```\n@import '../../vender/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss';\n```\n\nThis works locally.

Notice at the top how the input text is expanded on the right but not on the left. The width: auto present on the left side, first CSS rule, is the one causing this difference, and somehow that's missing from the right-hand version. For the record, both windows have exactly the same width.\n  Hi everyone,\n\nI'm sorry but I did not find how to fix the bug.

How does this work. I am using grunt to compile my project and can't seem to get the javascripts to be compiled correctly.\n Hey! I guess we're using the same setup and having the same problem - concat task is not grabing the javascript files required in the bootstrap.js file (the one with the  //= require's).\n\nMy workaround was a change in concat task, this\n\n``` javascript\nconcat: {\n      js: {\n        src: [\n          './bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js',\n          './site/assets/javascripts/*.js'       \n        ],\n        dest: './public/assets/javascripts/application.js'\n      }\n    },\n```\n\nto this \n\n``` javascript\nconcat: {\n      js: {\n        src: [\n          './bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/affix.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/alert.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/button.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/carousel.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/collapse.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/dropdown.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/tab.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/transition.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/scrollspy.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/modal.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/tooltip.js',\n          './bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/popover.js',\n          './site/assets/javascripts/*.js'       \n        ],\n        dest: './public/assets/javascripts/application.js'\n      }\n    },\n```\n\nkeeping the same order as in bootstrap.js file.\n\nWould like to ear more about this issue, still a grunt newbie.\n I had the same issue when migrating from `sass-bootstrap` to this project (`bootstrap-sass-official`). However, **I prefer to describe my assets requirements in the HTML** instead of _Gruntfile.js_.\nTo do so, I leverage [`usemin`](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin) mechanism, that will generate the `concat` configuration for me :) \n\n### index.html\n\nI just place my asset inside a [`usemin's block`](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin#blocks)\n\n``` html\n<!-- build:js scripts/bootstrap.js -->\n<script src=\"bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/tooltip.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/button.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/tab.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/collapse.js\"></script>\n<!-- endbuild -->\n```\n\n### Gruntfile.js\n\nHere is the `Gruntfile.js` generated by yeoman (I didn't modify it):\n\n``` js\n// Reads HTML for usemin blocks to enable smart builds that automatically\n// concat, minify and revision files. Creates configurations in memory so\n// additional tasks can operate on them\nuseminPrepare: {\n  html: '<%= yeoman.app %>/index.html',\n  options: {\n    dest: '<%= yeoman.dist %>'\n  }\n},\n\n// Performs rewrites based on rev and the useminPrepare configuration\nusemin: {\n  html: ['<%= yeoman.dist %>/{,*/}*.html'],\n  css: ['<%= yeoman.dist %>/styles/{,*/}*.css'],\n  options: {\n    assetsDirs: ['<%= yeoman.dist %>']\n  }\n}, // be aware of commas\n```\n\n### Shorter pathes\n\nIf you don't want to repeat the path up to each file you can use [`assetsDirs` options](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin#assetsdirs) (not tested):\n\n``` js\n  options: {\n    assetsDirs: ['foo/bar', 'bar']\n  }\n```\n  Resolves issue #616 on rails. \nSince SASS is pre-processor and autoprefixer is post-processor, I cannot find better way to keep up changes with original bootstrap.\n  Replication from LESS in SASS of following issue:\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/13014 \n The upstream issue also isn't merged, so it is probably better to what till one of the propsed PRs for this is merged. After that the converter should handle this.\n What @nschonni said. This should be dealt with using the converter script.\n  Active progress bars are not animating in my Rails 4 app with bootstrap-sass 3.1.1.1. Downgrading to 3.1.1.0 fixes the issue.\n\nMy code:\n\n```\n<div class=\"progress progress-striped progress-small active\">\n  <div class=\"progress-bar progress-bar-success\" style=\"width: 100%\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n Having this same issue.\n\nSeems to be fixed by adding:\n\n```\n@-webkit-keyframes progress-bar-stripes {\n  from {\n    background-position: 40px 0;\n  }\n  to {\n    background-position: 0 0;\n  }\n}\n@keyframes progress-bar-stripes {\n  from {\n    background-position: 40px 0;\n  }\n  to {\n    background-position: 0 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut not in Firefox - the progress bars don't even seem to be striped there.\n +1\n ```\n@-webkit-keyframes progress-bar-stripes {\n from  { background-position: 0 0; }\n to    { background-position: 40px 0; }\n}\n\n\n@-moz-keyframes progress-bar-stripes {\n from  { background-position: 0 0; }\n to    { background-position: 40px 0; }\n}\n```\n\nJust added that code at the bottom of my css to override what bootsass was trying to do and it worked.\n\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/5e583f0219dc6195e3fc5910e053716c06b523ea/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_progress-bars.scss\n So that doesn't seem to work in Firefox, as the stripes in progress-striped don't even show. The reason for this seems to be that something in rails/sass/bootstrap-sass is stripping the \"-gradient\" part of \"linear-gradient\" without browser prefixes.\n\nSo for example, `background-image:         linear-gradient(45deg` becomes `background-image:         linear(45deg` after processing by the asset pipeline.\n\nI was able to fix using the bourbon gem and adding this code:\n\n```\n.progress-striped .progress-bar {\n  @include background-image(linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent));\n}\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure how to fix this in the bootstrap-sass gem overall.\n Just to reiterate, the final, complete fix using the Bourbon gem is to add:\n\n```\n@include keyframes(progress-bar-stripes) {\n  from {\n    background-position: 40px 0;\n  }\n  to {\n    background-position: 0 0;\n  }\n}\n\n.progress-striped .progress-bar {\n  @include background-image(linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 50%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 75%, transparent 75%, transparent));\n}\n```\n\nFrustratingly just adding the resultant CSS doesn't work as \"-gradient\" is stripped from the non-vendor-prefixed \"linear-gradient\". I'm not sure what's causing that to get stripped though, if anyone has ideas they'd be much appreciated.\n I think this issue occurred when Bootstrap started to manage vendor prefixes with autoprefixer.\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/cb7eb674accd24b6b73f26ef23cf4a301b6ebfaf#diff-263cb0d16954573b23bf1cc8c2a14e2cL9\n Since bootstrap is going to deprecate vendor prefix mixins from less, I think bootstrap-sass gem will eventually need vendor prefixer...\n +1 having this also.. downgrading to 3.1.1.0 doesn't work for me\n +1 Running into this as well. Using the 3.1.1 package from bower.\n  Requires users to uncomment the whole variable chain when customizing Bootstrap.\n\nThis PR tries to address #613.\n Looks like the build failure is unrelated to the commit.\n  Assume a newly compass + bootstrap-sass project:\n\n```\n$ compass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\n```\n\nThis produces the following directory structure (bootstrap-sass 3.1.1.1):\n\n```\n my-new-project\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.rb\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 fonts\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 bootstrap\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 javascripts\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n \u251c\u2500\u2500 sass\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _variables.scss\n \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 styles.scss\n \u2514\u2500\u2500 stylesheets\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500 styles.css\n```\n\nThe documentation says\n\n> This will create a new Compass project with the following files in it:\n> \n> `_bootstrap-variables.scss` - all of bootstrap variables (override them here).\n> `styles.scss` - main project SCSS file, import `variables` and `bootstrap`.\n\nWell first, the file that compass created is called `_variables.scss`, and not `_bootstrap-variables.scss` but I believe this changed recently.\n\nThen the `_variables.scss` files tells you:\n\n>    // Override Bootstrap variables here (defaults from bootstrap-sass v3.1.1.1)\n\nIt says **override**. And leaves the content of the file fully commented. This gives the impression you can e.g. tweak a single color variable. So let's pretend you want to tweak `$gray-light` and change it to `red`: you just have a single line to change right?\n\nWell it's broken, because Bootstrap defines other variables to `$gray-light`, e.g. [`$headings-small-color`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L834). **So at the point you decide to change `$gray-light` to `red`, `$headings-small-color` is already `#999999` :(**\n\nYou can reproduce the behavior with this simple `bug.scss` file:\n\n```\n@import 'bootstrap/variables'; // very first line of sass/_variables.scss\n\n$gray-light: red; // it's as if I only changed this line in sass/_variables.scss\n                  // pretend rest of sass/_variables.scss is commented out\n                  // as it's the case with a newly created compass project\n\n// it's worth noting that bootstrap/_variables.scss defines:\n// $headings-small-color:        $gray-light !default;\n// and the corresponding line is sass/_variables.scss is commented out\n\nbody {\n  color: $headings-small-color; // what color do you expect?\n                                // nope it's not going to be red\n                                // but #999999, the default one :(\n}\n```\n\nI don't know which solution to recommend. Maybe it's les surprising if `sass/_variables.scss` doesn't [`@import \"bootstrap/variables\";`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/templates/project/_bootstrap-variables.sass.erb#L1). Choosing this solution means you have to override/uncomment the whole variable chain when customizing variables.\n\nThoughts?\n I love how this was supposed to be a ultra-minor point release, still based on bootstrap 3.1.1, but a bug fix to the sass implementation.  Yet TONS of stuff changed / broke.\n Tried SASS and bootstrap-sass the first time and also got this error, very frustrating, as a newbie to SASS i have no idea what i can do now.\n @gpakosz In `sass/_variables.scss`, the variables are defined with the `!default` flag, which means that if they are already defined, they won't be defined again (i.e. not overridden).\n\nThis means that if you override your variables _before_ `sass/_variables.scss` is imported, it should work just fine.\n @elmertoft I'm not sure you understood what I'm after. The problem really is that the generated `my-new-project/sass/_variables.scss` starts with `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"` and as you're mentioning variables are defined with `!default`:\n\n> which means that if they are already defined, they won't be defined again. \n\nThis is the point. They are not already defined when `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"` kicks in. So they take a default value.\n\nUncommenting/tweaking variable definitions in that generated `my-new-project/sass/_variables.scss` has unexpected effects as I explained. The unexpected effects are caused by \"variable chaining\" like [`$headings-small-color: $gray-light !default`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L834).\n\nIf you uncomment and tweak `$gray-light: red;` in `my-new-project/sass/_variables.scss` then it's too late for `$headings-small-color` which already took the default gray value.\n\nThat's why I'm suggesting the generated `my-new-project/sass/_variables.scss` should not start with `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"`. Keeping that first `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"` line will confuse  beginner or users switching from Less to SASS. No doubt.\n @gpakosz Ok, now I follow what you mean :-) I agree with you that the `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"` line should be removed from the `my_new_project/sass/_variables.scss` file, as per your pull-request (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/pull/614).\n\nThat should solve the issue completely, since `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"` is on line 2 in `~/your_path/bootstrap-sass-3.1.1.1/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss` which gets imported by the `@import \"bootstrap\"` that comes _after_ `@import \"variables\"` in `my_new_project/sass/styles.scss`.\n\nI think the readme also needs to be updated with an explanation on how the `!default` flag works.\n  Sprockets-sass (used by Sinatra and Middleman) stores its sprockets context in a different location than Rails. This PR checks for this case and fixes: https://github.com/middleman/middleman/issues/1265\n Thank you\n  From _variables to _bootstrap-variables.sass.erb\n  Move source files to the root and symlink the files back to the old vendor location. Left the Rails and sprocket files in the vendor locations.\n\nFixes gh-535\n [Symlinks in git don't work usefully on Windows.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917249/git-symlinks-in-windows) Don't know whether we really care about Windows though.\n Yeah, the symlinks are only for the ruby gem part but someone that actually knows ruby should verify\n  Version copied from https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/bower.json#L35-L37\n\nFixes gh-603\n No problem\n  Ping @shama since it looks like you are package owner of https://www.npmjs.org/package/bootstrap-sass\n Awesome! @glebm Just let me know which npm user to `npm owner add` on.\n :+1: looking forward to this.\n @glebm Cool. You are now an owner. Feel free to `npm owner rm shama bootstrap-sass` if necessary. Cheers!\n @glebm could you comment here when published? Thanks!\n Works! Thanks for this, helped simplify my project.\n :thumbsup: \n  Previously, the percentage of the LESS `fadein` function was being used directly as the opacity, which resulted in an opacity of `0.05` rather than `0.25` as the LESS version generates.\n\nWe can use the SASS `fade_in` function to more accurately generate the correct color using the same values; the only difference is that SASS's `fade_in` expects a decimal value, rather than the percentage that LESS accepts.\n\n---\n\nWhen I ran the `rake convert` task, several other unrelated files were changed, which I haven't included in this commit because it's unclear which changes are a result of this fix, and which are a result of changes in the upstream Bootstrap LESS files. Please let me know if I should explicitly include generated SASS files in this pull request, and I'll get right on it.\n  `bower.json` is currently not consistent with the docs and with what actually works when doing `bower install`.\n Wouldn't it be better to get this fixed in the bower repository? You can now unpublish your own packages, but they may be able to just override the URL for the current `bootstrap-sass` entry instead\n Turns out the name change is already pending per #584.\n They do eventually get to it :wink: jQuery-Validation finally got changed over without breaking the old package name\n @jlong could now do it or someone else with contrib access to the original fork by using the new CURL method described at the top of https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120\n  Without any custom style, the height of buttons in input-group-btn is one pixel less than the height of the corresponding input field (33px vs 34px). (Observed in Safari 7.0.3 and Chrome Canary 36.0.1961.3 using bootstrap-sass 3.1.1+2 with Sass 3.3.6)\n![input-group-btn](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4600573/2817554/c733fabc-ceda-11e3-8856-36556a54dcbe.png)\n\nThe button has the correct height of 34px when using the Less version of bootstrap. The issue is caused by a difference in precision between Less and Sass: The `line-height` of `.btn` is defined as `1.42857143` (Less) vs. `1.42857` (Sass).\n Thanks, I missed that detail!\n I've created a pull request for generator-gulp-webapp to prevent others from making the same mistake: https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp/pull/104\n  Hello,\n\nI'm new to Bootstrap so please forgive me if I overlooked something.\n\nThe main `README.md` states:\n\n> Assets are discovered automatically on Rails, Sprockets, Compass, and Node + Mincer, using native asset path helpers.\n\nYet I felt the need to define and import `_bootstrap-compass.scss` with the following definitions for `twbs-font-path` and `twbs-image-path`:\n\n```\n@function twbs-font-path($path) {\n  @return font-url($path, true) \n}\n\n@function twbs-image-path($file) {\n  @return image-url($path, true) \n}\n```\n\nI needed it so that generated URLs take into account my Compass' `http_fonts_dir` and `http_images_dir` settings.\n\nPS: I chose to open an issue instead of asking for support on Stackoverflow because eventually what I described means `twbs/bootstrap-sass` should provide such a `_bootstrap-compass.scss` file. Also, I'm not really in need for support since I solved it for my case.\n I'm confused by the use of Sass in a JS file as a solution\n @nschonni ah yeah wow, for sure it's a `.scss` file, not a `.js` file.\n\nI edited the comment above and replaced `_bootstrap-compass.js` by `_bootstrap-compass.scss`.\n @glebm thanks handling it.

:)\n Hi @glebm,\n\nAnother thing that I had to change to bootstrap-sass-official works was:\n/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js to:\n\n```\n//= require ./bootstrap/affix\n//= require ./bootstrap/alert\n//= require ./bootstrap/button\n//= require ./bootstrap/carousel\n//= require ./bootstrap/collapse\n//= require ./bootstrap/dropdown\n//= require ./bootstrap/tab\n//= require ./bootstrap/transition\n//= require ./bootstrap/scrollspy\n//= require ./bootstrap/modal\n//= require ./bootstrap/tooltip\n//= require ./bootstrap/popover\n```\n\nBtw, my application.js is:\n\n```\n//= require jquery\n//= require jquery.turbolinks\n//= require jquery-ujs\n//= require bootstrap-sass-official\n...\n```\n Hi @glebm,\n\nAnother thing that I had to do in order to bootstrap-sass work properly via Bower in a Rails 4.1 was change the bower.json to \n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"bootstrap-sass\",\n  \"version\": \"3.1.1\",\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass\",\n  \"authors\": [\n    \"Thomas McDonald\",\n    \"Tristan Harward\",\n    \"Peter Gumeson\",\n    \"Gleb Mazovetskiy\"\n  ],\n  \"description\": \"bootstrap-sass is a Sass-powered version of Bootstrap, ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications.\",\n  \"main\": [\n    \"vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\",\n    \"vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\",\n    \"vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\",\n    \"vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\",\n    \"vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss\",\n    \"vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js\"\n  ],\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"ignore\": [\n    \"**/.*\",\n    \"lib\",\n    \"tasks\",\n    \"templates\",\n    \"test\",\n    \"*.gemspec\",\n    \"Rakefile\",\n    \"Gemfile\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWithout this adjust, only the affix.js had been loaded.\n\nWhat do you think?\n Hi @glebm, first of all, thank you so much for your help.\n\nNow, I've made the checkout of this commit and the system has broken for 2 reasons: \n\n1 - In order to the glyphicons work with Sprockets, apparently, the old path was correct. \nIt means, instead of:\n\n```\n//= depend_on_asset \"./../../fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"./../../fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"./../../fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"./../../fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n```\n\nIt must be:\n\n```\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n```\n\n2 - Having the bower.json get back to the original, the Bootstrap's JavaScript stopped being loaded again, take a look:\n![screen shot 2014-06-18 at 6 17 59 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361140/3307515/76217e6e-f66d-11e3-9e18-33562f8aaee3.png)\n\nHave you got any suggestions of how should I be able to load all JavaScripts properly in my environment?\n\nThis is my application.js:\n\n```\n//= require jquery\n//= require jquery.turbolinks\n//= require jquery-ujs\n//= require bootstrap-sass\n...\n```\n\nThank you so much for your help one more time.\n Hi @glebm, it's almost there.\n\nI've checked out the commit e2e7020 and the _bootstrap-sprockets.scss works perfectly. :)\n\nHowever, now I'm getting the following error:\n\n```\nSprockets::Rails::Helper::DependencyError - Asset depends on 'bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot' to generate properly but has not declared the dependency\nPlease add: `//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"` to '/Users/roalcantara/Documents/caesars/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss'\n```\n\nIt seems to me that instead of **_depend_on**_\n\n```\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n```\n\nIt should be **_depend_on_asset**_:\n\n```\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n```\n\nApart from this, apparently only the file **affix.js** is being loaded. Since we cannot change bower.js, do you have any ideas of what should I do in order to load the JavaScript files properly?\n\nThank you so much for your time and consideration.\n Hi @glebm,\n\nApparently the JS are loading properly. It seems to me that it was just a cache problem - my bad. =\\\n\nHowever, apparently, the file _glyphicons.scss still must be changed from  **_depend_on**_ to **_depend_on_asset**_ in order to Sprockets work properly.\n Hi @glebm,\n\nI've changed the dependency to bootstrap (instead of the bootstrap-sass):\n\nbower.json\n\n```\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"jquery\": \"~2.1.1\",\n    \"jquery-ujs\": \"*\",\n    \"bootstrap\": \"~3.1.1\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\n and overrided the path for the fonts:\n\napplication.scss:\n\n```\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n/*\n *= require_self\n *= require_tree .\n */\n@import \"bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap\";\n\n/* Override Bootstrap 3 font locations */\n@font-face {\nfont-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\nsrc: url(font-path('bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot'));\nsrc: url(font-path('bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix')) format('embedded-opentype'),\n     url(font-path('bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff')) format('woff'),\n     url(font-path('bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf')) format('truetype'),\n     url(font-path('bootstrap/dist/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular')) format('svg');\n}\n```\n\nand now everything is working properly.\n\nThe only (minor) problem is that, apparently, the browser is requesting the old path and the new path:\n\n![screen shot 2014-06-19 at 7 12 18 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/361140/3326788/dbb340b0-f7a2-11e3-91c1-04ac2bfe9ad0.png)\n\nHowever, the fonts are shown properly in all browsers - and this is what's matters most. :)\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for your help.\n It seems that the issue is still present. I'm trying for first time bower-rails to use bootstrap-sas\n\nWith\nrails (4.1.4)\nbower-rails (0.7.3)\n\nBowerfile:\n\n```\nasset 'bootstrap-sass-official'\n```\n\napplication.css:\n\n```\n*= require bootstrap-sass-official\n```\n\nI got the couldn't find file 'bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot' error unless I specified the full path on **_glyphicons.scss** as\n\n```\n//= depend_on \"bootstrap-sass-official/assets/fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n```\n I solved it by adding the following to `config/application.rb`:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.assets.paths << Rails.root.join(\"vendor\",\"assets\",\"bower_components\",\"bootstrap-sass-official\",\"assets\",\"fonts\")\n```\n It appears our troubles have been [resolved](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/pull/126) by Sprockets v2.1.4, which no longer needs `depend_on` in this case. I've updated branch `next`, see the commit above for details. Let me know if this works.\n  Using:\n\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\"\n//= depend_on_asset \"bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\"\n\nin glyphicons.scss breaks sprockets as the //= means require\n\nif I change the location of the font directory then it will fail\n\nCheers\n I don't know if I'm having a related problem but maybe. With 3.1.1.1, I didn't have this issue. The app looks for glyphicons in /assets/bootstrap/{glyphfontname}.{ext} Unfortunately in production these are missing the signature numbers that are appended to it: /assets/bootstrap/{glyphfontname}-signature.{ext} instead it gets a 404 looking for them without the signature. Is there any way to fix this?\n That's done. Problem is with that included. But only with fonts everything else loads correctly.\n  I use RoR 4.1 along with bootstrap-sass 3.1.1.1.\n\nIn the development environment I get errors in the console about missing fonts:\n\n```\nActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] \"/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\"):\n  actionpack (4.1.0) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/debug_exceptions.rb:21:in `call'\n  actionpack (4.1.0) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb:30:in `call'\n  railties (4.1.0) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:38:in `call_app'\n  railties (4.1.0) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:20:in `block in call'\n  activesupport (4.1.0) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:68:in `block in tagged'\n  activesupport (4.1.0) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:26:in `tagged'\n  activesupport (4.1.0) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:68:in `tagged'\n  railties (4.1.0) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:20:in `call'\n  quiet_assets (1.0.2) lib/quiet_assets.rb:18:in `call_with_quiet_assets'\n  actionpack (4.1.0) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/request_id.rb:21:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/methodoverride.rb:21:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/runtime.rb:17:in `call'\n  activesupport (4.1.0) lib/active_support/cache/strategy/local_cache_middleware.rb:26:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/lock.rb:17:in `call'\n  actionpack (4.1.0) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/static.rb:64:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/sendfile.rb:112:in `call'\n  railties (4.1.0) lib/rails/engine.rb:514:in `call'\n  railties (4.1.0) lib/rails/application.rb:144:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/lock.rb:17:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/content_length.rb:14:in `call'\n  rack (1.5.2) lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:60:in `service'\n  /home/marcin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/lib/ruby/2.1.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:138:in `service'\n  /home/marcin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/lib/ruby/2.1.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:94:in `run'\n  /home/marcin/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.0/lib/ruby/2.1.0/webrick/server.rb:295:in `block in start_thread'\n```\n\nI've found out that if I use the following URL: `assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff` everything works properly.

I have also found https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-bower-install but it seems to be for a more specific use case so I don't have an easy way to test it. Are there any other tools you'd want to see compatibility with?\n\nAside from all of that, my understanding is that most build tools will be using the `bower list` command to build a list of package assets:\n\nhttps://github.com/yatskevich/grunt-bower-task/blob/devel/tasks/lib/bower_assets.js#L60\nhttps://github.com/curist/grunt-bower/blob/master/tasks/bower.js#L32\n\nFor my simple bootstrap/bootswatch sass project, the `bower list` output looks like:\n\n```\n{\n  \"bootstrap-sass-official\": [\n    \"lib/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss\",\n    \"lib/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js\"\n  ],\n  \"font-awesome\": \"lib/font-awesome\",\n  \"bootswatch-scss\": \"lib/bootswatch-scss\"\n}\n```\n\nMost of the other packages I have seen don't even specify main, so we see an \"effective\" main which is a directory. It may be that the bower.json spec does not mention directory vs. file, but it seems that build tools should be capable of handling a directory correctly if bower itself is capable of outputting one.\n\nHappy to amend the PR based on your feedback - just soliciting your thoughts on the proper direction for bootstrap-sass.\n Also, #585 expands out the list of JS files but fails to do so for the SCSS, leaving the broader issue only half-fixed. I can easily switch this PR back over to a huge list of each file in `vendor/assets` - only drawback is that it will have to be maintained if/when the partial files themselves change names.\n `main` is not supposed to contain directories, only filenames: https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec/issues/19\n Thanks @cvrebert for digging that information up. Good to know.\n It seems that this is not working with the broccoli-bower build tool. broccoli-bower is very alpha so the fix is probably on their end, but I want to point it out because I believe broccoli is increasing in popularity and should be on the radar, especially with its recent adoption by the emberjs team.\nI think the problem comes from multiple files with the same name, such as _alerts.scss. I will look more closely at the bower spec. I am unsure if there are any conventions regarding uniqueness for included file names.\n How is `_bootstrap-mincer.scss` supposed to work outside Rails? The reasoning behind this dramatic change in `bower.json` should be explained somewhere, and definitely doesn't seem like it should be released under a `+1` tag, because this updates even in places where `=3.1.1` is specified.\n The bug is that the order of these stylesheets is weird, aren't variables supposed to be included first?\n This breaks tools like [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep) which use the `main` property of `bower.json` to import assets. I believe ordering them like they're ordered in `bootstrap.scss` will fix this issue, but that way you lose that bit of automation.\n It does. Well, it imports those files, but I hadn't had the chance to deal with that issue yet, because the `alert` component already causes an error because it's been imported before `variables`. Concerning those two stylesheets, I would probably just ignore them in a gulpfile or something, so they would not be imported.\n This comes from my lack of understanding why individual stylesheets were included in the `bower.json` instead of just `bootstrap.scss`.\n\nThis is tough, I will get back to you tomorrow :)\n The Bower folks themselves still haven't figured it out yet: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/935\nBower seems to be kind of a mess for nontrivial stuff at the moment; their current spec is simply too lacking.\n Thanks for pushing that, @glebm! I think that's all that's needed. Considering the following file:\n\n> styles.scss\n\n``` scss\n// bower:js\n// endbower\n```\n\nafter running `wiredep`:\n\n``` scss\n// bower:js\n@import \"bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss\";\n// endbower\n```\n\nI tried this with a fresh `yo angular`, and everything compiled successfully. Unless you see any issues with this @silvenon, I'd write this one off as resolved :)\n Thanks! :heart: I see no issues with this.\n  I noticed the `main` property in `bower.json` is defined as [bootstrap.js](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js), whose contents look like this:\n\n``` js\n//= require bootstrap/affix\n//= require bootstrap/alert\n//= require bootstrap/button\n//= require bootstrap/carousel\n//= require bootstrap/collapse\n//= require bootstrap/dropdown\n//= require bootstrap/tab\n//= require bootstrap/transition\n//= require bootstrap/scrollspy\n//= require bootstrap/modal\n//= require bootstrap/tooltip\n//= require bootstrap/popover\n```\n\n`main` is meant to define the file(s) which are usable by the consumer of your component. The file above isn't usable outside of the environment of this repository, so I simply added the individual files to the `main` array.\n\nA better option may be to include the distributable version of `bootstrap.js`, such as the [bootstrap repo does](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/bower.json#L18).\n  I find the name is easier to remember.\nAs discussed here https://github.com/jlong/sass-bootstrap-defunct/issues/143\n  I created a nuget folder which contains the proper files for use with NuGet (ASP.NET package manager). It will pull the exact files from the appropriate folders within the master branch. Only oddity is the version number in the Package.nuspec file. I am waiting on a response from the NuGet team, but I accidentally published a package with version 3.1.1 and unfortunately they don't allow you to overwrite a version. So instead I had to make it 3.1.02, which is of course not ideal. \n :+1: on the nuspec, but :-1: on including the binary\nI was looking at http://appveyor.com com for some Windows builds, and they offer NuGet publishing as part of the CI\n So what are your thoughts on how to achieve this? I guess I was under the impression that NuGet pushing was a manual publish process, not an automated one. I need the binary to publish it correctly. Also, how is it possible to automate it without exposing the NuGet API key?\n You can publish if you have the binary in your path. I don't think people on other platforms (like Bower) want to pull down the extra 1.6 megs for the NuGet binary.\n I see, that makes sense. I removed it and will just manually re-add it in whenever I need to build future version(s). Does that solve the issue?\n Protip: If you don't squash down the commits, the EXE is still going to end up bloating the git history\n squashed the past 3 of my commits...\n Correct. It is used with Visual Studio on Windows. And that's alright, I'll just use it personally instead...\n @glebm I believe it can be run with Mono, but it is a .Net package manager so the main user base is on Windows.\n @jamez14 if you update the `<files>` section to map to the existing repo location, then the powershell script shouldn't be needed (I think). Then it is just a matter or running `nuget pack Package.nuspec` to create the zip/package\n Cleaned up the publish.ps1 to pull from existing repo location. Also I have it pull down binaries in publish file. Not sure if this solved the issue of being able to run on Mono or not. If it's still not up to par, I'll just make it the unofficial Nuget package for bootstrap-sass. I'm currently using it at work with our app successfully.\n Alright, should I create this separate repo or hold off for now?\n Perhaps Outercurve could do the packaging? They already manage the Less-based Bootstrap package: http://www.nuget.org/packages/bootstrap/\n Just as an FYI, I updated my NuGet package to v3.2.0 this morning. I'm not sure if we ever came to a conclusion on this, but either way, here's the source/package links: [GitHub project](https://github.com/jamez14/bootstrap-sass-nuget) & [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Twitter.Bootstrap.Sass/)\n  I try setting this variable `$icon-font-path:` to something relative such as `\"fonts/bootstrap\"`, but it always compiles to `\"//fonts/bootstrap\"` as if it were using a full url or cdn.\n\nIs it possible to have a relative path?\n I have the same problem! You could fix?\n @CesarRotela No, unfortunately. I had to reload the font. Not a good solution but it works :(\n\n```\n@import \"compass\";\n@import \"variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: url(\"fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\");\n  src: url(\"fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix\") format(\"embedded-opentype\"), url(\"fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\") format(\"woff\"), url(\"fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\") format(\"truetype\"), url(\"fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons_halflingsregular\") format(\"svg\");\n}\n```\n Ok, thanks mate!\n CC: @twbs/sass \n I just updated to 3.2.0.1, and I had to set `$icon-font-path: \"/assets/bootstrap/\"` to make the icons work. With this, the `@font-face {...}` stuff isn't necessary.\n 3.2.0.1 breaks fonts on development without additional config, why was this changed?  3.2.0.0 worked fine.\n Thanks, glebm! This was the problem. I had to fight so many times already with this problem (and similar ones) that I didn't think about taking a look at the README again.\n Including the bootstrap-sprockets js appears to break the bootstrap nav dropdown\n Any updates on this, only happened when upgrading from TWBS 3.0.3 to 3.2\n @betam4x @Braunson `bootstrap` contains all of JS concatenated in 1 file, while `bootstrap-sprockets` has a //= require directive for each component. Check that you are not including both.\n Thanks, I'm actually not using Rails but Asset-Pipeline in Laravel, I ended up changing my path from ../assets (which previously worked before updating TWBS) to /../ which now works. Really weird.\n thank @glebm this line solved: @import \"bootstrap-sprockets\";\n  I installed bootstrap-sass with ruby installer, then i created file and placed \n@import \"bootstrap\";\nin it, i wrote the following to compile the file\n\nsass --watch main.scss:main.css --style expanded\n\nit gave the subject error. : file to import not found or unreadable : bootstrap\n\ni know I am mission one option, when i use compass i write the code in command like this\n\nsass --compass --watch main.scss:main.css --style expanded\n\nto use bootstrap there might be code like --bootstrap something like this, i dont know, need help please.\n same here with rails 4.1\nversion 3.1.1\n is there any solution? @MichaelSp \n I had two issues here:\n1. @import 'bootstrap-sass';\n2.

Thank you!\n  Hi Guys,\n\ni don't know if this is really a bootstrap-sass problem, but i don't know where to start. And the Problem exists only with the bootstrap-sass gem.\n\nI want render some stylesheets in production on the fly. I have the following code (simplefied):\n\n``` ruby\nclass DynamicStylesheet\n  # logical_path = 'app/assets/stylesheets/test.css.scss'\n  def render(logical_path, data={})  \n    path = Rails.root.join(logical_path)\n    context = MyApp::Application.assets.context_class.new(env, logical_path, Pathname.new(path))\n\n    Sass::Rails::ScssTemplate.new(path.to_s).render(context,{})\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nSo far everything works fine. I can import other scss files in my test.css.scss. But when i import bootstrap the following error occur:\n\n```\n1.9.3-p448 :001 > DynamicStylesheet.new.render('app/assets/stylesheets/test.css.scss')\nSprockets::Helpers::RailsHelper::AssetPaths::AssetNotPrecompiledError:  isn't precompiled\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/actionpack-3.2.17/lib/sprockets/helpers/rails_helper.rb:142:in `digest_for'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/actionpack-3.2.17/lib/sprockets/helpers/rails_helper.rb:151:in `rewrite_asset_path'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/actionpack-3.2.17/lib/action_view/asset_paths.rb:27:in `compute_public_path'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/actionpack-3.2.17/lib/sprockets/helpers/rails_helper.rb:56:in `asset_path'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/actionpack-3.2.17/lib/sprockets/helpers/rails_helper.rb:67:in `font_path'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.1.1.0/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb:18:in `twbs_asset_path'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.1.1.0/lib/bootstrap-sass/sass_functions.rb:6:in `twbs_font_path'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/script/funcall.rb:112:in `_perform'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/script/node.rb:40:in `perform'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/script/operation.rb:73:in `_perform'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/script/node.rb:40:in `perform'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:327:in `visit_variable'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:100:in `visit'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `block in visit_import'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `map'\n... 15 levels...\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:128:in `visit_root'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:100:in `visit'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:7:in `visit'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/tree/root_node.rb:20:in `render'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/engine.rb:315:in `_render'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-3.2.14/lib/sass/engine.rb:262:in `render'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/sass-rails-3.2.6/lib/sass/rails/template_handlers.rb:106:in `evaluate'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/tilt-1.4.1/lib/tilt/template.rb:103:in `render'\n    from /Users/matt/dev/tippmate/tippmate/lib/dynamic_stylesheet.rb:9:in `render'\n    from (irb):1\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/railties-3.2.17/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:47:in `start'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/railties-3.2.17/lib/rails/commands/console.rb:8:in `start'\n    from /Users/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p448@tippmate/gems/railties-3.2.17/lib/rails/commands.rb:41:in `<top (required)>'\n    from script/rails:6:in `require'\n    from script/rails:6:in `<main>'1.9.3-p448 :002 > \n```\n\nWhen i look at the source code of the last method (digest_for) there should be a logical path as input.

Not a CDN with the whole Bootstrap files, but only with the Glyphicon ones. At 3.0.0 it was there:\n`//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap-glyphicons.css`\n Ah, you meant the Glyphicons **CSS**. Yeah, there's indeed no separate CDN file for that.\n  Currently, the compile task always creates a `tmp/` directory, even if\nanother directory is specified. The specified directory was also not created\nif necessary. This PR changes the task so that it creates a specified directory (or the `tmp/` directory) first, then compiles the css into it.\n  In only exports main .scss file which is pretty useless without the partials.\nIt also doesn't export font files.\n\nThe config in CSS repository looks OK\n Working on a PR for this now.\n\nIs there any build tool or set of build tools that should be supported in preference to any others? I am working with `grunt-bower` and `grunt-bower-task` right now.\n Thanks, this issue seems resolved to me.\n  I'm trying to sort out the best way to include this library into my project. I created application.css.scss and intended to import the master bootstrap.scss file into it but I am not sure what the right way is to handle this. I've attached a screenshot of my directory structure. Any help is appreciated. \n\nI'm using this in a Node/Express project. \n\nThanks~\n![screen shot 2014-03-16 at 7 55 38 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/874215/2432677/37c7c76e-ad6f-11e3-8cc5-66545c2ff89d.png)\n The project I'm currently working on has an src/views directory, where a PHP file for each view of my site is located (e.g. services.php, gallery.php, staff.php, etc.) and an src/common directory with things like navigation.php, footer.php, etc. The src/index.php file builds a single site page upon every request to the server, based on what some mod_rewrite rules in an .htaccess file feed it with as $view & $lang query string arguments.\n\nSo, what pertains to your question, each view file is a wholly contained site module that allows me to build up my site in a pretty scalable way. As such, each of them has a corresponding SCSS stylesheet file in src/styles, all of them using a bower-installed bootstrap-sass. Being modular themselves, too, each stylesheet leverages inclusion of other \"library\" sylesheets to eliminate redundancy. I have an src/stylesheets/_common.scss partial that does the following:\n\n 1) Imports a site-wide variables-override stylesheet where I customize any bootstrap setting I want (src/stylesheets/_varaibles.scss):\n\n```\n@import \"variables\";\n```\n\n 2) Imports bootstrap-sass itself and bootstrap-theme: \n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap\";\n@import \"bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/theme\";\n```\n\n3) And finally, and as its name implies, defines the styling for the elements that are common to all site views, like precisely the navigation bar and the footer. E.g.:\n\n```\n.navbar\n{\n    blah;\n    blah;\n}\n\n.footer\n{\n    foo;\n    bar;\n}\n```\n\nThen each view style, e.g. services.scss, brings bootstrap-sass in, and the rest of the common styling of course, by way of a very simple import of the common partial:\n\n```\n@import \"common\";\n```\n\nThen, of course, each view stylesheet is free to do its own styling of its view elements without affecting any other view in any possible way.\n\nFinally, the entire site style for a given view is included into the HTML by the view itself through a commonplace link tag:\n\n```\n<!-- build:css(.tmp) styles/services.css -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen, projection\" href=\"styles/services.css\">\n<!-- endbuild -->\n```\n\nThe HTML head does no separate inclusion of navigation styling, footer styling or any other, since all of those end up being included in each view CSS after stylesheet compilation. This may seem redundant at first (\"why repeat navigation and footer styling in each view stylesheet?\") but actually it's quite the opposite, since every request to the server produces a page containing at most a single site view through PHP inclusion. A positive side-effect of this is that on every request, the browser will only download the CSS necessary to render the specified view, and nothing else.\n\nThe actual compilation & minification of the stylesheets, which is what produces the wholly contained CSS files, is taken care of by a Gruntfile I built based on yeoman's webapp generator, which is a great place to start; I highly recommend you take a good look at it if you haven't yet. In short, you're gonna need the contrib-compass and usemin gruntjs plugins to get started, among many others.\n\nAll in all, I feel this is a pretty good modular approach that allows me to scale my site project horizontally through view \"packages\"/modules that I can add at any time without affecting the rest of the site in any way, including the existing views. All the while I also get to leverage bootstrap-sass, modernizr, bower, gruntjs, and all of these other new & great front-end dev technologies that are making webdev exciting again.\n\nHope that helps you to get moving in the right direction!\n @twbs/sass Can someone either give a response or close this as out-of-scope?

I can try and help though. What's in your Gemfile/Gemfile.lock?\n Hi Thomas\n\nThat would be great! I\u2019ve really hit a dead end after hours of searching! I used the default files on git hub. Somebody pointed out that my compass version didn\u2019t work with the sass version so I tried down grading sass and also upgrading compass to an alpha.\n\nHere are my current

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L532\n\nThe `fadein` method does not exist in Sass, so this results in a string assignment (like \n\"fadein(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 5%)\"). The [opacify](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#opacify-instance_method) method has similar functionality, but takes a value between 0 and 1 instead of a percent.\n It seems like `rgba($popover-border-color, 0.25);` produces a similar effect.\n @glebm What about fade_in or opacify? http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#opacify-instance_method\n I'm pretty sure this is actually broken (see [my comment](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/df7be4f0412497e22f1d271d94d6e9835f61113e#commitcomment-6164044)). I'll submit a pull request to fix it, and look at the functions that @guigs mentions.\n Yeah, my current hack function is this \n\n``` scss\n@function fadein($colour, $pct) {\n    @return opacify($colour, $pct / 100);\n}\n```\n\nYou can add that to your sheet before Bootstrap is imported if you are using 3.1.1\n I've submitted a pull request to hopefully fix this: #600.\n  version: bootstrap-sass (3.1.1.0)\n\nIf I set `$modal-inner-padding` in my variables.scss, for example, to `9px 15px`, like this:\n\n``` css\n$modal-title-padding: 9px 15px;\n```\n\nthe generated css looks like this:\n\n``` css\n.modal-footer {\nmargin-top: 15px;\npadding: 9px 15px-1 9px 15px 9px 15px;\n```\n\nto make it more clear, if I set to `\"9px 15px\"`, the output is this:\n\n``` css\n.modal-footer {\nmargin-top: 15px;\npadding: \"9px 15px\"-1 \"9px 15px\" \"9px 15px\";\n```\n\neven weirder: `.modal-body` and `.modal-footer` are basically identical and it doesn't work just for the footer:\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_modals.scss#L94-L101\n @glebm awesome. I've forgot to look at the tag.\n\nBtw, it would be super cool if we can split `.modal-footer`'s and `.modal-body`'s padding in different variables.\n Hmmm, if memory serves, I made some upstream changes coming in v3.1 that might fix this with different padding values all together.\n @glebm awesome, thanks\n  I'll just leave it here.\n\nUsing bootstrap-sass by [mincer](https://github.com/nodeca/mincer) (nodejs sprockets port)\n\nFirst step: rebuild node-sass https://github.com/andrew/node-sass#rebuilding-binaries\nit is necessary because https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/494\n`\n$ cd node-sass\n$ npm link\n$ cd project\n$ npm link node-sass\n`\n\nFinal step: file `application.css.ejs.scss`\n\n```\n// hack\n$bootstrap-sass-asset-helper: true;\n\n// full logical path + suffix\n@function twbs-font-path ($path) {\n  @return \"<%- asset_path('#{$path}'.replace(/[#?].*$/, '')) + '#{$path}'.replace(/(^[^#?]*)([#?]?.*$)/, '$2') %>\";\n}\n\n@function twbs-image-path ($file) {\n  @return \"<%- asset_path('#{$file}') %>\";\n}\n\n// fix 'full' logical path\n$icon-font-path: \"bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/\";\n\n@import \"../bower_components/bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap\";\n\n// using bootstrap mixin\n#logo {\n  @include img-retina(\"logo-x1.png\", \"logo-x2.png\", 316px, 100px);\n}\n```\n @mahnunchik, thank you for this idea. :+1:\n @mahnunchik saved me a lot of time. Thanks!\n @glebm  Thanks. I will submit a pull request in a few days.\n Thanks =)\n  I am sure this is just a dream but is there any chance of .sass files, not .scss? I come from a python background where code looks clean and does not need unnecessary curly braces.  When code is indented correctly without the need for braces is just prettier : ), i know... just cosmetic.\n I don't think we should offer this. One of the goals of Bootstrap, be it in .less or .scss, is to ensure code is readable and approachable by folks of all experiences and skill levels. Removing the braces gets too far away from that.\n I understand. I disagree with the readability, i think css is a ugly \"language\" and a syntax that forces indention with parent child relationships makes it clear. But like i said, i am sure i was dreaming. \n\nThanks for all that you guys do, really do appreciate it.\n It's not an opinion on what is ugly or not, it's about what's most like CSS :).\n I understand that point, but that is also what is so crazy to me. Most everyone agrees that CSS is not that great. So people create cool things to make it better, but instead of keeping something like sass, or anything that is better, we fall back in the name of backwards compatibility for something that isn't good. Seems like the wrong direction. \n\nBut in the end these are just my opinions, and it seems like way more people like the uglier version because they can write vanilla css, why would anyone want that haha! Some things i'll just never understand lol.\n If the creation of the files is handled by a script, is there any possibility of having a .sass and a .scss set of files?\n That would be cool, hopefully they would do it.\n\nFor the life of me i'll never be able to figure out why people like braces\nso much. All formats should be well formatted code with indentions, whats\nthe need for braces then? I am talking to myself i know lol, i'll probably\nbe confused by people needing unnecessary braces until the day i die haha.\n\nOn Thu, Jun 5, 2014 at 6:24 AM, Paul Mackay notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> If the creation of the files is handled by a script, is there any\n> possibility of having a .sass and a .scss set of files?\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/545#issuecomment-45212709.\n The approachability of code matters most to me here.\n\nSay a brand new beginner to CSS and Bootstrap decides she wants to start using this Sass port.

I am not sure if i could do it with my\nsetup. I am using grunt-compass to compile all of my .sass files. I have to\nspecify \".sass\" in the grunt config.

New users aren't always willing nor able to learn \"better\" tools up front. Not only is \"better\" massively subjective, but by making new users do all the leg work, we cramp their style, their determination, and their creativity. We make Bootstrap fundamentally that much harder to approach.\n\nI don't mean to rail on you about it, just wanting to provide as much context as possible. That kind of thinking is what we strive to avoid here.\n\n<3\n Importing bootstrap's as Scss files into a project don't prevent to write your own code in sass. What's the problem ?\n @mdo that makes perfect sense. Especially about the usage of \"better\". I wasn't really trying to sound like a dick, but i can see how it came across like that and i apologize. I am not the best writer so conveying my real thoughts doesn't always work out. \n\nRecently i had a buddy who wanted to learn programming, instead of teaching all of the hard things i went through for years i taught him all of the cool new things that i wish i would of had someone to teach me, bootstrap/sass/angular and python/AppEngine for the backend. \n\nIts been really good and he is way farther than i ever was in the same amount of time. That kind of teaching is what i was thinking when i wrote my comments. I know there are many cons to that approach, especially if i am not there to help or he can't choose his technologies. I just wanted to give some context to what i was saying, so i hopefully I don't sound like a total development dictator! As always, thanks for taking the time.\n @j-walker23 <3\n @shipow isnt is necessary to be able to build the Bootstrap files if changing the variables? \n  I am trying to compile bootstrap-sass with pyScss in my Python application. I am using the [basic navbar example](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar). However, the navbar links in `ul.nav.navbar-nav` are only 40px. In my inspector, it looks like the CSS from my compiler and the one on the Bootstrap site are different.\n\nFrom pyScss (notice the `padding-top/bottom: 10px` is above the `15px`):\n![screen shot 2014-02-26 at 8 58 30 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/858647/2278352/b7578558-9f52-11e3-9edf-1b927e3148b9.png)\n\nFrom getbootstrap.com:\n![screen shot 2014-02-26 at 8 59 24 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/858647/2278362/f2566e1c-9f52-11e3-978a-a7843ff586b3.png)\n @glebm So, can this old issue be closed?\n  when using \"compass install bootstrap-sass\"\non windows it gives error after create javascripts/bootstrap/affix.js\nit gives error:EACCES permission denied on c:/ruby193/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.1.1.0/templates/project../..vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap\nusing windows 7\njavascript files and fonts don't exist on the creating project \n download rubyinstaller from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/\n\nrun \"command prompt with ruby\"\n\ntype gem install bootstrap-sass\n\nwait for it to install.\n closing due to lack of updates\n  `rake compile` throws error:\n\n```\nundefined method `mkdir' for File:Class\n```\n\nThere is no class method `mkdir` in the File class (see line 46 in the Rakefile).\n\nChanging to `Dir.mkdir` fixes it.\n Deep in other problems. Have not been able yet to get bootstrap-sass to work in a newly created Rails 4 project. I tried copying vendor/assets to app/assets, but sass compilation fails with an unknown variable `$alert_padding` in _alerts.scss.\n\nI'm about to give up on this...\n @renier Can you share any more info on how your app is setup?\n I'm using Rails 4.0.3 (on Ruby 2.1.0). My Gemfile includes the bootstrap-sass gem. Made sure `bundle install` ran, so Gemfile.lock is up-to-date.\n\n`@import`-ed \"bootstrap\" from application.css under app/assets/stylesheets/. Also added the `//= require bootstrap` comment in application.js.\n\nAdditionally, I copied over the bootstrap-sass assets as described in my previous comment. When loading the basic welcome controller's index action with a simple view (using one of the bootstrap examples at getbootstrap.com/getting-started), I get the SASS compliation problem:\nunknown variable $alert_padding in _alerts.scss.\n\nWhat is strange is that there is a _variable.scss that is loaded first and has that variable defined. So not really sure what is happening. This is how I inferred how to set bootstrap-sass up, as I'm not familiar with the asset changes in Rails 3 and 4, and the README seems to assume you to be (so not a great help). If someone can point out what I did wrong in my process, that would great.\n  When compiling bootstrap.sass I get the following error:\n\n```\nCompilation Error. \nSee error list for details\n<my file path>\\bootstrap\\sass\\_mixins.scss:363: error: non-terminal statement or declaration must end with ';'\n```\n\nThe line the error specifically calls is: `background-image: url(if($bootstrap-sass-asset-helper, twbs-image-path(\"#{$file-1x}\"), \"#{$file-1x}\"));`\nlocated in the `img-retina` mixin.\n  A novice user can not understand the current readme if he don't know ruby and bundle.\nPlease update the readme to make clear following things\n1. Where the commands should be executed\n2. Do we need git repository to execute the commands \n Also, this readme is not very framework/language agnostic. How about setting things up in frameworks like Play?\n Yeah, I've been trying to make sense of it but can't.\n\nFirst of all, for bundle command to work you need \"gem install bundler\"?\n\n\"In your Gemfile ... \". What gemfile, where?\n\nWhat is gem 'sass-rails', '>= 3.2'? Isn't Rails that the thing SASS and everything is built on and it's the first thing you install? Or is it sass? Then what is \"gem install sass\"?\n\nHow can I have \"Compass without Rails\" if sass is built on Ruby on Rails?\n\nNow I think i need\n  bundle exec compass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstra\nbut it says \n  DL is deprecated, please use Fiddle\n  Could not locate Gemfile\n hkirsman, \nI am having the same exact problem. I don't know what to do!\n I downloaded this package and included vendor / assets / stylesheets / bootstrap.scss into my theme sass file.\n I've made myself this setup. Say, my theme folder is mytheme. So the structure is like this:\nmytheme/\n-- bootstrap-sass/\n-- css/\n-- img/\n-- sass/\n---- includes/\n------ 10-header/\n------ 20-content/\n------ 30-footer/\n---- bootstrap.scss\n---- global.scss\n---- variables.scss\n\nIn the sass folder I have copied\nbootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss\nand\nbootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss\n\nIn my local sass/bootstrap.scss I change the paths so that the files are included from bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/ folder except the variables file. This I include from my own sass folder. This way I can choose  bootstrap modules by commenting out the lines in bootstrap.scss and also I have a local variables.scss with all the variables for simple override.\n\nSo my global.scss is the thing that clues everything together. It contains:\n// Bootstrap library.\n@import 'bootstrap.scss';\n\n// Theme specific.\n@import 'includes/*_/_';\n\nSee the last line. This includes automatically all the files I have inside sass/includes folder. I am a hierarchy wizard so I have logo.scss, nav.scss etc. The auto import is possible tx to https://rubygems.org/gems/sass-globbing\n\nIn Linux I run (I have script inside sass folder):\nsass -r sass-globbing --watch global.scss:../css/global.css\n\nAnd some extra magic. Did you know that it's possible to inspect scss files with Chrome:\nhttps://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/b4daab987fb0\nI highly recomend enabling it!\nBasically you need the latest sass and compile with:\nsass -r sass-globbing --watch --sourcemap global.scss:../css/global.css\n It would be very useful if the README referenced a tutorial.  Following the instructions for Compass, I'm noticing that bootstrap.js is no where to be found.  So the install instructions are missing something.\n  Hey folks,\nI'm using the package with Bower and I was wondering: is there any particular reason why the source files have the `vendor/assets/{x}/bootstrap` directory structure? Wouldn't it be more intuitive to have a root `bootstrap` folder with just `javascript`, `fonts` and `scss` subfolders with the files inside them?\nI'm not familiar with the Rails asset pipeline nor with Rake building, so if I'm talking non-sense please forgive me and carry on with the awesome work!\n Also, because of the long path name, it's inconvinient to import stylesheets from my source file (for example, `@import \"vendors/twbs-bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/close\";`). A folder structure like the LESS Bootstrap would be more convinient.\n @glebm I imagined that. well, nevermind ;)\n > It's like this because we couldn't make it work reliably with Rails 3 any other way \n\nIs this true? In Rails 4 asset paths are set in an [engine initializer](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/engine.rb#L599), perhaps we could just modify?\n\n``` ruby\ninitializer :append_assets_path, group: :all do |app|\n  app.config.assets.paths.unshift(*paths[\"vendor/assets\"].existent_directories)\n  app.config.assets.paths.unshift(*paths[\"lib/assets\"].existent_directories)\n  app.config.assets.paths.unshift(*paths[\"app/assets\"].existent_directories)\nend\n```\n\n(too lazy/tired to check for lower versions now, will leave this open and try and push an example branch tomorrow)\n I also think it would be better if the sass-port maintains the same folder structure as the normal releases: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#whats-included-source\n\nThis port is not only meant for Rails users, right?\n +1 on removing the **bootstrap** part of `vendor/assets/{x}/bootstrap` paths. Or have separate (eww) paths for Bower vs Rails asset.\n > This port is not only meant for Rails users, right?\n\nNo, but it was originally. Support for other packages has kinda been 'tacked on' since then, hence the (current) folder structure.\n Also having a precompiled dist directory like bootstrap-less would be very helpful.\n files now in /assets\n\n:boom:\n I would again suggest to follow the same structure the less-version does: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#whats-included-source\nWhat is the current reason for doing this differently?\n\n```\nbootstrap/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scss/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 js/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 fonts/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 dist/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 css/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 js/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 fonts/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 docs/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 examples/\n```\n why is the `dist/bootstrap` folder still there? isnt it obvious that its bootstrap from the package and main level folder?\n  If there are JS and/or CSS files you want to add to the precompile list, the instructions in [the README](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/57bbed7e6f8043ca05c3df36f0d41cc3211876b8/README.md#rails-32x) are inefficient.  If you want them to initialize bootstrap-sass on precompile, that does not require them to initialize ALL engines, so they should not use `initialize_on_precompile = true`.  Instead, you should instruct them to put the following in `config/application.rb` right after ending the `if defined?(Bundler)` block:\n\n```\nmodule BootstrapInitializer\n  class Railtie < Rails::Railtie\n    initializer :bootstrap_initializer, :group => :assets do\n      require  \"bootstrap-sass\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nSee [this Stackoverflow example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9235292/how-can-i-run-some-initializers-when-doing-a-rails-assetsprecompile), that addresses basically this exact issue.\n\nThis all assumes that you want bootstrap to be initialized on precompile for reasons other than adding non-JS/CSS assets to the precompile list.  [Bootstrap's initalizer](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/57bbed7e6f8043ca05c3df36f0d41cc3211876b8/lib/bootstrap-sass/engine.rb) doesn't include any JS or CSS assets, and according to [Rails' `config/application.rb`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.0/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/config/environments/production.rb.tt) (since Rails 3.1.0), \"application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS are already added\", so I am very curious why this is necessary at all.\n There is a cost savings to initialize_on_precompile being false (and, if I understand correctly, you can choose that in Rails4 too, it's just not the default).  Depending on what you're initializing, this cost savings could be substantial (it is in my case).\n\nThanks for clarifying which file is the one that we need to load during precompile.  So would it be enough to load that file in an initializer that's defined in config/application.rb? Or must we `require bootstrap-sass` so `that BootstrapSass.load!` is called?  Either way, I strongly urge you to clarify that in the README as an alternative to setting `initialize_on_recompile = true`.\n Thanks.  Can you just clarify one thing?  Why can't this gem be in the assets group in my Gemfile?\n Incorrect.  `rake assets:precompile` automatically sets a RAILS_GROUPS=assets env variable ([here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.17/actionpack/lib/sprockets/assets.rake#L7)).  See https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/railties/lib/rails.rb#L93 for the effect that has on `Rails.groups` in the line of code you quoted.  That's the whole reason the assets group exists--so that it's included in production, test and precompile but not in production.\n  Thanks for this awesome gem.\n\nWhen I bumped my app to version `3.1.1` I was getting 404 errors for the glyphicon asset files. The digest values that were getting being included in my HTML were not matching the ones in my public/assets directory. I've since reverted to `3.0.3` and things are working fine.\n I'm not too familiar with this codebase, but maybe it's because the sha needs to be updated?\n\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass/version.rb\n Same problem here with 3.1.1 as well as with 3.0.3, but only in production mode. Seems like it needs to be used asset-url() instead of url() to get the correct urls for the resources.\n If you want to look at the full rails app, you can find it here: https://github.com/cyrusstoller/RevTilt\n\nGems:\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'rails', '4.0.3'\ngem 'sass-rails',   '~> 4.0.1'\ngem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.0.1'\n```\n\nImporting bootstrap is in `application.css.scss`\n\n``` scss\n@import bootstrap;\n```\n\nThanks so much for looking into this.\n @glebm Thanks for the tip. I'll try that when I get home. \n\nOut of curiosity, why does `config.assets.initialize_on_precompile` need to be true now, when it worked when it was false before?\n I just ran into this same issue today.  The fonts are getting 'precompiled' with paths.  Based on my rudimentary knowledge of sass, it looks like `twbs-font-path()` in `_glyphicons.scss` isn't functioning properly for the asset pipeline.\n\n```\npublic/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-38faf686e6b14c64cb78bd9bbaf6e437.eot\npublic/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-f4be650343b7201c30a44a0f14fe7562.svg\npublic/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-a17d04d6bfad86fcfb01d2110a9362ff.ttf\npublic/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-2a998ec890f4efaabaa96e9a05bea36c.woff\n```\n @glebm Thanks so much for looking into this.

I don't understand why my system is compiling differently. \n\nI just tried https://github.com/cyrusstoller/RevTilt/tree/bootstrap, which just bumps up the version of `bootstrap-sass` to `3.1.1` in the first commit and tweaks `config.assets.initialize_on_precompile` in the second.\n\n---\n\nChanging `config.assets.initialize_on_precompile` to `true` made no difference.\n\n---\n\nWhen I deployed after having had version `3.0.3` it works fine, but when I moved the font files that had been in my assets directory, so that it would have to start from scratch, it didn't work.\n\nHere are the files that were created when creating assets from scratch using version `3.1.1`:\n- /assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-7531c2bd6e03c07cc2d83fa38e1e2218.ttf\n- /assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-9424bcf8f49d772c152e0b760b39b8f9.eot\n- /assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-ab814146cdfc4d37cc90765f7bf86107.svg\n- /assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-fcc658a3dec1be1cb0a9bb81f4c7c6de.woff\n\nI then get 3 different `404`s when loading a page with glyphicons.\n- http://revtilt.com/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-7d47a9edad93272cac476aa066c79089.woff\n- http://revtilt.com/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-fcbfc798de728d6bba563a9c261ea98f.ttf\n- http://revtilt.com/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-f12b5bfd39f0f612a6afe34d964ab188.svg\n\nBut these were the assets that were created by version `3.0.3` because they exist in the directory that I moved.\n\nMaybe this will help give you more information.\n\nI tried this using Vagrant with the following puppet manifests to setup my system - https://github.com/cyrusstoller/gardenbed.

This is a strange one.\n +1 to @jdinse's workaround, spent the better part of a day working on some asset issues that popped up when using precompiling for production and this was one of them.  I'm on \n\n```\nRails 4.0.8\nbootstrap-sass-3.2.0.0\nsass-rails-4.0.3\nsprockets-2.11.0\n```\n @jdinse +1 but this gives annoying 404 since it first loads fonts from bootstrap with wrong path and second from fixed path.\n According to the 3.2.0.1 readme I added `@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"` before the bootstrap imports:\n\n``` sass\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"\n@import \"bootstrap_customisations\"\n@import \"bootstrap\"\n```\n adding\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap-sprockets\"\n```\n\nas said by @felixbuenemann got the job done for me.\n  Grids have a percentage for their width and also\nspecify padding.  This causes the total width of\nthe grid to be larger than expected.\n  For the three `has-` classes (success, warning, error), the function call is currently using the `-text` color variable in the first two passes, but I believe the second should be the `-border` color variable.  This would seem to be a correct fix based on the variable definitions in `mixins.scss` on line 857.\n\nAs it exists now (`forms.scss` line 272)\n\n```\n.has-success {\n  @include form-control-validation($state-success-text, $state-success-text, $state-success-bg);\n}\n.has-warning {\n  @include form-control-validation($state-warning-text, $state-warning-text, $state-warning-bg);\n}\n.has-error {\n  @include form-control-validation($state-danger-text, $state-danger-text, $state-danger-bg);\n}\n```\n\nSuggested change:\n\n```\n.has-success {\n  @include form-control-validation($state-success-text, $state-success-border, $state-success-bg);\n}\n.has-warning {\n  @include form-control-validation($state-warning-text, $state-warning-border, $state-warning-bg);\n}\n.has-error {\n  @include form-control-validation($state-danger-text, $state-danger-border, $state-danger-bg);\n}\n```\n\nThanks for supporting SASS!\n Yes, this issue exists.\n  I cannot find in code twbs-image-path function that is used in _mixins.scss \n\nLine 363:   background-image: url(if($bootstrap-sass-asset-helper, twbs-image-path(\"#{$file-1x}\"), \"#{$file-1x}\"));\n    Line 372:     background-image: url(if($bootstrap-sass-asset-helper, twbs-image-path(\"#{$file-2x}\"), \"#{$file-2x}\"));\n Well how can I compile sass without ruby? \nFor example I want to use nodejs and grant as build system.\nI don't think that this is good idea to create some specific framework dependencies.\n however you compile sass without ruby usually _should_ work.\n\nRuby is the reference Sass implementation, but if the ruby files are not loaded then `$bootstrap-sass-asset-helper` is false, so `twbs-image-path` is not called.\n  I've created a new project. In the _variables file, I changed the variable for `$brand-primary` from `#428bca` to `green`. Compass watches without error. \n\nThen, I change `$font-size-h1: floor(($font-size-base * 2.6));` to `$font-size-h1: floor(($font-size-base * 3.2));` and get an error `sass/bootstrap-sass.scss (Line 56 of sass/_variables.scss: Undefined variable: \"$font-size-base\".)`\n\nWhat's the reason for error? Do I need to import another file or function into the _variables file?\n Think I just figured it out. Need to call `@import \"bootstrap/variables\";` and \n`@import \"bootstrap/mixins\";` into _variables.scss beforehand.\n Thanks @glebm.\n  I'm trying to find out what version of bootstrap-sass is installed. Running `which bootstrap-sass` returns nothing. Running `bootstrap-sass -v` returns `-bash: boostrap-sass: command not found`\n\nHow can I find out which version(s) and where boostrap-sass is installed? I've included boostrap-sass inside a Compass project by adding it to my config file. It works without error. I've verified it installed the latest version somewhere because I watched it install without error.\n Thanks @glebm. I'm new to this stuff. I just assumed, like finding out the version of Sass I have installed, I'd just have to run `sass -v` and the system tells me.\n you can also run `gem list bootstrap-sass`\n  Hi,\n\nI've been tailing my logs in production and I see method=GET path=/apple-touch-icon.png with a status 500\n\nMy app is on heroku.\n\nAny idea on what the problem could be?\n  Hi,\n\nis it possible to add tags for releases greater than 3.1.0?\n Should @glebm or @thomas-mcdonald do this, just let me know fellas and we can bump the docs to match in our `gh-pages` branch.\n I'd suggest being less strict on the bugfix number matching the core for the semver tags. Most people use wildcard selectors on that part of the version number anyway (`~3.1.0`), so bumping these to `3.1.1` might be better.\n I don't think there is a problem with having this out of sync in the bugfix release number. The upstream 3.1.1 can easily be 3.1.99 as long as it is reflected in the changelog/release notes\n @nschonni It'd be a huge problem to have the two repos out of sync like that. These things have to be in sync for the masses.\n OK, I don't want to get into the SemVer debate again. I think this can be closed since the tags were pushed.\n  I think it would be useful to indicate that this component must (/has to) be added not within the asset group's declaration but the default group, otherwise it won't be loaded. I tried to declare it within the asset's group and this didn't worked.\n Sorry, it was my mistake. I declared twice the sass-rails gem, even if both gems are in different  groups.\n\nIt works like a charm, sorry again and thanks for your reply. \n  After upgrading to version bootstrap-sass 3.1.0.1, I'm having the above error when precompiling assets.\n\nMy stylesheet contains.\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nAfter digging around a bit, i noticed the file\n\n```\nvendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/bootstrap.scss \n```\n\nis different from the previous working version 3.0.3.0, in which the @import statements are missing \"bootstrap/\" path component.\n\nversion 3.0.3.0\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\"; \n```\n\nversion 3.1.0.1\n\n```\n@import \"variables\";\n```\n\nAdding the missing path component allows me to precompile successfully.\n I'm running Rails version 3.2.16\n\nMy Gemfile reads\n\n```\ngem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'\n```\n\nand Gemfile.lock\n\n```\nsass (3.2.14)\nsass-rails (3.2.6)\n  railties (~> 3.2.0)\n  sass (>= 3.1.10)\n  tilt (~> 1.3)\n```\n\nThanks for looking into this.\n I'm able to replicate the problem on a fresh installation of rails 3.2.16 with only bootstrap-sass as the additional gem.\n\nThe problem appears when the @import is called in a file which is not placed in the root folder of stylesheets.\n\ne.g.\n\n```\napp/assets/stylesheets/dialog/signup.css.scss\n```\n\ninside signup.css.scss, simply\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nand precompiling will result in the above error.\n\nSome additional setup\n\napplication.rb\n\n```\nconfig.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false\n```\n\nproduction.rb\n\n```\nconfig.assets.precompile += %w( dialog/signup.css )\n```\n ```\nconfig.assets.initialize_on_precompile = true\n```\n\nTried it, still getting the same error.\n ok, here's the link.\n\nhttps://github.com/seantan/ab\n My bad for a typo in the production.rb. Fixed it, please take a look again. \n\nhttps://github.com/seantan/ab/commit/29034aa34550782c790baf4630c444afe156cf7c\n\nThe problem occurs when bootstrap is imported from a file that is \"non-root\" level relative to assets/stylesheets.\n Thanks for working on this tirelessly! I'll try out the workaround soon.\n\nBtw, any reason why there was a `@import` path change in the bootstrap/bootstrap.scss moving bootstrap-sass up to version 3.1.0.1 ? Naively, it seems to be only thing stopping the gem from working correctly in this situation. Is it possible/correct to revert the change?\n\nSince bootstrap-sass has become the Official port of Bootstrap to Sass , :+1: \nRails apps that still runs on Rails 3.2 (without the updated sprockets/-rails) will run into this problem when switching over from other bootstrap ports. \n\nIMO, it is important that the gem works out of the box without the workaround as it introduces uncertainties (backport gems and branch) which potential users might not accommodate.\n\nThanks again @glebm for for the incredibly fast response in coming up with the workaround solution. :+1: \n @glebm Tested the workaround and it works. Many thanks for the detailed explanation and releasing 3.1.0.2 which fixes the issue without requiring the workaround gems. :+1:  \n Just want to update that 3.1.0.2 works for my Rails 3.2.16 App, even with gems still inside `:assets` group, and `initialize_on_precompile = false`.\n FYI this works in Rails 3.2\n\n```\ngem 'compass-rails', '1.1.7'\ngem 'sass-rails', '3.2.6'\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.1.1.0'\n```\n  A quick fix for centering floated badges in buttons.\n I see, thank you!\n  Hello,\n\nI tried to create new compass project and got an error:\n\n> compass create -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\n> ...\n> Errno::EACCES on line [\"78\"] of C: Permission denied - C:/utl/Ruby193/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/bootstrap-sass-3.1.0.1/templates/project/../../vendor/assets/fonts/bootstrap/.\n\nAfter analyzing I found that ruby Dir.glob in manifest.rb didn't work as expected:\n\n> Dir.glob File.expand_path(\"#{bs_javascripts}/*.js\", File.dirname(**FILE**))\n\nreturned only affix.js\nand\n\n> Dir.glob File.expand_path(\"#{bs_fonts}/*\", File.dirname(**FILE**))\n\nreturned '.'\n\nMaybe that issue is reproduced only on Windows OS.\n\nI changed those lines to:\n\n> Dir.glob(\"#{File.expand_path(\"#{bs_javascripts}\", File.dirname(**FILE**))}/_.js\") do |path|\n> Dir.glob(\"#{File.expand_path(\"#{bs_fonts}\", File.dirname(**FILE**))}/_\") do |path|\n\nand now I have all js and fonts files in new project directory.\n Ruby version:\n\n> C:\\Utl\\Ruby193\\bin>ruby -v\n> ruby 1.9.3p327 (2012-11-10) [i386-mingw32]\n> C:\\Utl\\Ruby193\\bin>irb\n> irb(main):001:0> RUBY_VERSION\n> => \"1.9.3\"\n\nI tried to install Ruby 1.9.3-p484 on new installed windows 7 and all works fine.\nAlso I found discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubyinstaller/j0Uaz69z_r8/8_3c1e1kl6wJ \nI guess issue is in ruby, so I'm going to reinstall it.\n  Fixes gh-519\n In a shell script maybe, not from the command line\n If the package gets published it can be simplified to `bower install bootstrap-sass`\n I know I've run into that with another project too :frowning: \n  Getting this Error: \n\nbower bootstrap-sass#v3.1.0'          ECMDERR Failed to execute \"git ls-remote --tags --heads 'git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git\", exit code of #128 \n\nLooks like a missing single quote. \n Update: \nFails:\nbower install 'git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#v3.1.0'\n\nWorks: \nbower install git://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass.git#v3.1.0\n\nDropping the single quotes around the git url seems to resolve the problem\n  I am experiencing an error after upgrading bootstrap-sass from 3.0 to 3.1 on a Rails 4.0.2 project.\n\nI have `@import 'bootstrap'` in my `application.css.scss` file.

After checking it out, I noticed that Bootstrap is now implementing a \"scale\" mixin which already [exists in Compass](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/transform/#mixin-scale). For a quick fix, I just changed the import order so the Compass mixin was loaded later.\n\nI know this isn't really a bug, but perhaps it would be worth considering prefixing mixin names, adding warnings to the documentation or something in that direction, since a lot of people who use SASS use Compass as well.\n Word, I'll make a note of it @glebm.\n\nBtw, I just added you to the Owners team, @glebm, so that you can properly mention other teams. Sorry about that!\n  It looks like whatever happened with this commit: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/commit/fe9368e6321685bdbf9b2fb0bc40a36ae489f3d4 has caused the thumbnails file to go a bit funky.\n\nThe converter has removed some lines that have caused the hover and focus states to get the captions styles causing it double padding.\n\nhttps://www.monosnap.com/image/TZo7ZGq1UntQeUWaSglYyQ6VTXojF1\n\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/fe9368e6321685bdbf9b2fb0bc40a36ae489f3d4/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_thumbnails.scss#L24-L34\n For some reason bower is not pulling down these changes for me, but I did a manual copy & paste of the thumbnail file and yes this fixes the issue.

But in staging and production, on firefox (not chrome), the glyphicons are not correctly displayed.\n\nSurprising thing is that when I check the application-<hash>.css file that is precompiled, I can find this (after manual decompressing for readability):\n\n```\n@font-face{\n  font-family:'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src:url(\"http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-e76f5a754ccf64843a118a8706df3f8c.eot\");\n  src:url(\"http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot?#iefix\") format(\"embedded-opentype\"),\n  url(\"http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-0391150c52d1f65893d1d6b0d29fd0c9.woff\") format(\"woff\"),\n  url(\"http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-b5577a3f3fb089369af33ce56e196d02.ttf\") format(\"truetype\"),\n  url(\"http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg#glyphicons-halflingsregular\") format(\"svg\")\n}\n```\n\nThe actual urls work very well and they aren't CORS (website being hosted on mydomain.org):\n- http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-e76f5a754ccf64843a118a8706df3f8c.eot\n- http://cdn.mydomain.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-0391150c52d1f65893d1d6b0d29fd0c9.woff\n  etc.\n\nSo what am I doing wrong? \nAs it was reported on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20547060/1620081), I could copy files into `/public/assets/bootstrap/font-file-names.ext` but it feels very hacky, I won't be updating when gem updates, and for some reason it could be that public assets get deleted.\n\nMy gemfile is so:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.0.3.0' # No fancy :group => :assets\n```\n\nAnd I import it like this:\n\n```\n$font-family-sans-serif: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\n@import 'bootstrap';\n```\n\ninto a scss file after defining bootstrap variables, as specified in the doc.\n\nThanks for support\n You mean these ones in _glyphicon.scss ?\n\n```\n  src: url(if($bootstrap-sass-asset-helper, twbs-font-path('#{$icon-font-path}#{$icon-font-name}.eot'), '#{$icon-font-path}#{$icon-font-name}.eot'));\n\n```\n I believe this is a problem upstream, with bootstrap itself. I can reproduce it simply by visiting http://getbootstrap.com/components/ . The glyphs do not display correctly in Firefox, but display correctly in other browsers (Chromium, Konqueror).\n @glebm You're right,  I can see the glyphicons in Firefox now. Sorry for the false alarm.\n Here are the relevants extracts of the files you require:\n\n```\n# gemfile.lock\n    bootstrap-sass (3.0.3.0)\n      sass (~> 3.2)\n    sass (3.2.13)\n    sass-rails (3.2.6)\n      railties (~> 3.2.0)\n      sass (>= 3.1.10)\n      tilt (~> 1.3)\n```\n\n```\n# production.rb\nCopass::Application.configure do\n  # Code is not reloaded between requests\n  config.cache_classes = true\n\n  # Full error reports are disabled and caching is turned on\n  config.consider_all_requests_local       = false\n  config.action_controller.perform_caching = true\n\n  # Disable Rails's static asset server (Apache or nginx will already do this)\n  config.serve_static_assets = false\n\n  # Compress JavaScripts and CSS\n  config.assets.compress = true\n\n  # Don't fallback to assets pipeline if a precompiled asset is missed\n  config.assets.compile = false\n\n  # Generate digests for assets URLs\n  config.assets.digest = true\n\n  # Defaults to nil and saved in location specified by config.assets.prefix\n  # config.assets.manifest = YOUR_PATH\n\n  config.action_controller.asset_host = 'http://cdn.copass.org'\n\n  # Precompile additional assets (application.js, application.css, and all non-JS/CSS are already added)\n  config.assets.precompile += %w( libs/libs.js )\n\n  # Send deprecation notices to registered listeners\n  config.active_support.deprecation = :notify\n\nend\n```\n\nHope it helps!\n So, as in the firebug console, here is the message I get:\n\n```\ndownloadable font: download failed (font-family: \"Glyphicons Halflings\" style:normal weight:normal stretch:normal src index:1): bad URI or cross-site access not allowed\nsource: http://cdn.copass.org/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-0391150c52d1f65893d1d6b0d29fd0c9.woff\n```\n\nQuery coming from alpha.copass.org\n\nI guess, the problem doesn't come from bootstrap-sass not including the font correctly, but more a cross-domain issue I need to solve. I'll report if I can fix this.\n It worked! Thanks so much, every other solution I tried did not work!\n  Was linking to http://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass, which now redirects to https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass\n  Often, I want to mark something for screen-readers-only, but only at small screen sizes -- at large screen sizes, there's enough room for the thing, but at small sizes I want to hide it -- except not hidden from screen-readers, even at small-sizes. \n\nI suspect this is not an unusual desire?\n\nBootstrap provides the `.sr-only` class for hiding things from visible screens but providing them still to screen-readers. \n\nHowever, [because of the way SASS works](http://designshack.net/articles/css/sass-and-media-queries-what-you-can-and-cant-do/), you can't really do an `@extend .sr-only` inside a media query, and have it work properly.    \n\nSo I end up having to just copy-and-paste the .sr-only definition where I want it inside a media query, very un-DRY. (or into my own SASS mixin, an improvement, but still a copy of the original)\n\nI think this limitation isn't really the same in the original LESS.  \n\nBut for the SASS version, it would be very helpful if .sr-only were provided as a SASS mixin instead of just a class, so you could `@include` it inside media queries, when you want things to become sr-only at small sizes. \n\nI don't understand enough about how the bootstrap-sass build process works to submit a pull request sorry -- I'm not sure whether it's possible to make the build process convert .sr-only in the LESS to a mixin in SASS, or how to do it. But I suggest it might be a good idea?\n Right, but the workaround would be making a mixin corresponding the .sr-only class, since SASS does support the equivalent with mixins. \n\nIf Bootstrap were natively SASS, I'd be filing an issue for Bootstrap main branch saying \"It would be useful if you would expose .sr-only as a mixin, not just a class, so it could be used in this way in SASS.\" Since Bootstrap starts out in LESS and is converted to SASS, I am filing an issue here saying \"It would be useful if, upon conversion to SASS, you converted this to a mixin instead of just a class, so it could be used this way in SASS.\"\n\nBut okay, I understand you are not interested in that at this time, so it goes! \n\n(SASS does kind of support extend inside media querries -- it just doesn't do what you might want it to do, and would want it to do in this case.)\n  My composer file looks like:\n\n```\n\"require\": {                                                                  \n  \"laravel/framework\": \"4.0.*\",                                               \n  \"kriswallsmith/assetic\": \"*\",                                               \n  \"cartalyst/sentry\": \"2.0.*\",                                                \n  \"illuminate/database\": \"4.0.*\",                                             \n  \"twbs/bootstrap-sass\": \"3.0.*\"                                    \n}\n```\n\nWhen I run composer, I get the following:\n\n```\n  Problem 1\n    - The requested package twbs/bootstrap-sass could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.\n\nPotential causes:\n - A typo in the package name\n - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting\n   see <https://groups.google.com/d/topic/composer-dev/_g3ASeIFlrc/discussion> for more details.\n```\n\nI don't know if anyone else has experienced a similar problem, but, my current hypotheses circle around the following:\n- There's no composer.json file for this project (a la, https://github.com/jlong/sass-bootstrap/blob/master/composer.json)\n- There is a pre-existing naming issue that might be contributing to the problem (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/460).\n- Or perhaps I'm mucking up the version numbers?\n\nI'm leaning toward the first option.\n The problem is that according to [SemVer](http://semver.org/) any version number with a dash + characters at the end is considered prerelease\n\n> A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92.\n @glebm Thanks for jumping on that so quickly. Alas, that didn't seem to fix it though. But, I have good news! After looking a little deeper, the problem became clear: bootstrap-sass was _not_ on Packagist. There is, however, a record for twbs/boostrap (https://packagist.org/packages/twbs/).  I went ahead and added bootstrap-sass to Packagist (https://packagist.org/packages/twbs/bootstrap-sass/maintainers/) and if you, or someone else, creates a Packagist account, I'll add people as maintainers. I can also add Daniel Martins from the twbs/bootstrap package if he's someone that is involved here too. \n\nCouple things I noticed:\n\nFirst, to require the package the JSON string is:\n\n`\"require\": { \"twbs/bootstrap-sass\": \"dev-node-sass\" }`\n\nWhich deviates from the norm of:\n\n`\"require\": { \"twbs/bootstrap-sass\": \"dev-master\" }`\n\nNot sure why that is.\n\nSecondly, I think the homepage is listed incorrectly: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/composer.json#L5\n I've added you as a maintainer. When I get a chance, I'll look into Packagist conventions and documentation to see if I can determine if there are simple things we can do to make the composer integration better (for instance, the GitHub Service Hook seems like a good idea).\n So, other than the versioning (which is its own separate issue), this is resolved and can be closed?\n Nope. _NOPE_. Composer is **not** made for front-end package, stop polluting the registry with packages like these, it's a PHP package manager. You want to handle Bootstrap in a manifest ? Use Bower.\n +1 with @Anahkiasen. You should remove composer.json from this repo. This is just a hack.\n @Anahkiasen Composer is intended for whatever packages you want/need to include in your PHP project. Bower is a great tool and has a focused application that is perfect for many situations. However, isn't it silly to suggest that Bower is the _only_ and \"right\" way to include bootstrap-sass into a project? I imagine there are undoubtedly many equally good approaches that undermine your assertion. Why should this library be made less ecumenical? To avoid polluting the registry? Come on. And why would you presume you know so much that you blithely tell other people how they should organize their applications?\n Because you can probably install Bootstrap with NPM too that doesn't mean it's made for that. The Composer website states :\n\n> This idea is not new and Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler. But there has not been such a tool for PHP.\n\nClearly saying it's meant to be NPM and Rubygem's equivalent for PHP. I'm not saying Composer _can't_ do it, I'm saying your using the wrong tool for the job. Bower isn't the _only_ tool for that but at least it's made for that, you can use Component too, or Jam, or [whatever other front-end package manager there is](https://github.com/wilmoore/frontend-packagers), but I don't see the need to try to make Composer do everything because it's not its purpose.\n\nNot to mention if really you **do** absolutely want to have one and only package manager file in your project you can easily do so via the `repositories` entry :\n\n``` json\n\"require\": {\n  \"twbs/bootstrap-sass\": \"version\"\n},\n\"repositories\": [\n  {\n    \"type\": \"vcs\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass\"\n  }\n] \n```\n\nWithout having to register it on Packagist where it's out of place. Composer can't ignore files from the build to make packages lighter to install, Composer has no notion of main JS or CSS file, etc. Composer has nothing for front-end packages while Bower has all these features, because that's _not_ its job. In the light of that I really don't see why anyone would want to use Composer for that. Surely the fact that its core is a **PHP classes autoloader** should mean something no ?\n Nope, nope and **nope**. Composer is _maybe_ a package manager written in PHP but is **realy not** a package manager for **frontend development**. Bootstrap is purely a front-end framework, without **any** tools for PHP.\n\nIf I want to install bootstrap on my projet, I use Bower/Jam (and the other guys of my team too). The `composer.json` doesn't include any frontend tool. That's not the purpose.\n\nSo **please** remove this from Packagist !\n Yikes, we have some opinionated folks here. Lot's assertive bold text. \n\nThere's a degree of convenience that Packagist/Composer provides with little cost on this end (although it sounds like several people believe otherwise). For better or worse, many people browse/search Packagist for tools they can deploy quickly without a lot of hassle. Whether it's a _correct_ usage of Packagist, I am not prepared to argue too strongly in either direction on that question. I would defer to someone with a convincing argument--which @Anahkiasen almost achieves except that his argument (and prevailing opinion in this thread) seems to assume that everyone can/wants to use Bower, Node and npm:\n\n> If I want to install bootstrap on my projet, I use Bower/Jam (and the other guys of my team too).\n\nand\n\n> I'm not saying Composer can't do it, I'm saying your using the wrong tool for the job. Bower isn't the only tool for that but at least it's made for that, you can use Component too, or Jam, or whatever other front-end package manager there is\n\nThat there may be situations where that's not possible or practical seems not to matter, or at least not your problem?\n Regardless of whether such packages are technically proper/correct/intended, folks are clearly making use of them:\n\n> [twbs/bootstrap: This month: 12,137 installs](https://packagist.org/packages/twbs/bootstrap)\n\nAnd Zurb Foundation also has a Composer package: https://packagist.org/packages/zurb/foundation\n Yeah, folks need to calm down on this. We have composer support in the main Bootstrap repo, and we should have one here in the Sass port as well. No reason to not do it. It's already in `master`, so closing this out.\n  great work guys\n The only issue I'm seeing right now when using node-sass is in _mixins.scss, with the [img-retina mixin](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss#L362). When commenting this mixin node-sass compiles successfully.\n this version ffbba22a50269d564bb674481bdeccf97efd3989 of node-sass was built bootstrap without any changes\n When will this be released? \n I am using \"bootstrap-sass-official\": \"~3.2.0\" and \"node-sass\": \"0.8.6\" but I am still getting this error!!\n\n```\nWarning: bower_components/bootstrap-sass-official/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/glyphicons:17: error: non-terminal statement or declaration must end with ';'\n Use --force to continue.\n```\n  The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.\n Yes. And my own theme and others themes defines some mixins. So what? It's not part of bootstrap.\nIt's separated files.\nbootstrap.css compile from boostrap.less(scss) which include many files.\nbootstrap-theme.css compile from theme.less(scss) which include onlu 'variables' and 'mixins'.\n\nAnd as you known theme.less(scss) this is example for Bootstrap 3, which added some styles from Bootstrap 2\n  Hello,\n\nI have Compass installed, but not rails. I wanted to add Bootstrap to an existing project so I used installation process B in the documentation. \n\nThe gem installed successfully, and I've added the require to my project's config.rb. The problem I'm having is with running \"bundle exec compass install bootstrap\" -- when I do so I get the following error message: \"Could not locate Gemfile\".\n\nI can see Bootstrap-Sass is present in my .rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/ directory, and I'm using Bundler version 1.3.5. The error message isn't very clear about what Gemfile is missing...\n\nI'm a bit of a Ruby noob so thanks for your help.\n The documentation assumes you are using a Gemfile to manage the versioning of your Compass dependencies.  This is a doc fail rather than one on your part, you can simply drop the `bundle exec` from the command and it will run fine.\n\nI'm sure there's a good article somewhere about using Gemfiles with non-Rails projects (google-fu is failing me), but they're a good way of 'locking in' specific versions of gems, for deployment or team development.\n Just for sake of completeness, I have a similar problem understanding the workings of bootstrap-sass:\n\nI have only the Sass compiler installed (`scss`) in a non-Ruby project, Django for the curious. And I'm only interested in a few parts of bootstrap, therefore I would version only two files, `bootstrap.scss` and `_variables.scss`. How do I do that without having to integrate all referenced (but not necessarily changed) `.scss` files of the project? In the end I'm only interested in the generated `.css` file, customized according to the 2 versioned files mentioned earlier.\n\nWith Ruby it sounds easy: specify the dependency and overwrite some behavior somehow. How do it without?\n Thanks for your clear explanation @thomas-mcdonald. I managed to install without a hitch owing to your help! I was tempted to try and run the command without the bundle prefix before, but thought it best to ask somebody who knows better than me first. It is a shame that the documentation is so patchy for what seems like such a great project -- I'd hate to think of others being put off using it for that reason.\n\nAs an aside, I can see the benefits of using Bundles, but I only use Ruby for Compass and Sass at the moment, so I'm not sure I'd stand to gain much benefit at the moment. Another one of those rainy day projects...\n @bittner +1 for this.\nWhat Bootstrap Framework (a CSS Framework) as to do with Ruby/Rails stuff?\nI understand that you work with it to convert LESS version to Sass as maintainers, but why is it necessary to be in a Ruby context to use it?\nUsers should be able to simply download/drop the .SCSS files in their project (whatever it is, HTML, PHP...) and go on.\n @Grsmto Well, the Sass compiler (scss) is a Ruby beast. Therefore, anyone using the .scss files needs Ruby installed (locally) to compile .scss files to (a single) .css (file). The point I'm making is, how does one correctly use bootstrap-sass (in a non-Ruby project) without having to put the whole load of .scss files of this project under version control---and go through the usual upgrade hell for each and every small change done to bootstrap.\n\nIn short, I'm happy to depend on the latest bootstrap always, with a few minor customizations I hold in _variables.scss and bootstrap.scss\n I don't know if this answers the question about using bootstrap-sass in a non-ruby context, but what I do is simply install bootstrap-sass (sudo gem install bootstrap-sass, which may or may not pull in the compass gem dependency, don't quite recall) and then simply \"init\" my project with bootstrap-sass through compass, as indicated in the documentation:\n\ncompass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\n\nOnce that's done, my new project has a config.rb file that tells compass where to put the products, and all I need to do is run \"compass watch &\" only once before I start seeing my CSS files get recompiled each time I change their scss sources (the & in the above command sends the job to the background, where it lurks without bothering me until I decide to stop it). Works like a charm!\n There are still things I haven't solved in that workflow (like not having to explicitly script-include every single bootstrap JavaScript file I need in my HTML, minifying my own JavaScripts, etc. -- I'm leaning towards something like grunt/bower for a single one-shot web deployment solution), but at least I don't have to worry a single bit about ruby, gems, rails, etc., other than knowing compass is using some of that underneath to compile my CSS. In fact, I don't even know what \"bundle\" is, I've looked around on my various systems and I can't find a single reference to that command (and I'm pretty far from CLI-iliterate); I just run compass directly, as explained above, since \"bundle exec\" is obviously out of my reach until I find the time/interest to look into that.\n\nHTH!\n\nPS: I edited my two comments to split them in two. GitHub doesn't seem to tell you when you're out of characters here...\n @jmpalacios As far as I know, there is no character limit on comments :).\n @mdo Yeah, I later realized that wasn't the problem. GitHub was rejecting\nmy comment precisely up to the part where I was writing \"script-include\n(\u2026)\" because I was trying to write that in actual HTML syntax, so probably\nsome protection system was kicking in and rejecting the < & > characters\nwrapping the \"script\" word. Injection concerns, perhaps? ;)\n\nOn Thu, Jan 30, 2014 at 12:29 AM, Mark Otto notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> @jmpalacios https://github.com/jmpalacios As far as I know, there is no\n> character limit on comments :).\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/492#issuecomment-33660408\n> .\n @glebm Thanks for that link, gonna look into it. Just at first glance, it seems like an alternative to bower. Am I correct?\n\nAnd as for libsass & node-sass (funny, I was reading about libsass just yesterday), what will the new workflow be like? Will we be able-to/have-to forego compass to work with bootstrap-sass as I described in my comment above? Any documentation on a full solution?\n\nThanks for all the info!\n Is it planned to have a pre-compiled version of Bootstrap-sass on the repo ? (equivalent of the 'less' folder on twbs/bootstrap). I suppose it can't be synced with Bootstrap-less releases but...\nLots of Bootstrap users use it by directly downloading via the homepage download button.\nOr what about any way to build Bootstrap-sass server side and serve it on getbootstrap.com ? (as on a custom build generator)\n :)\nNo I mean the `less` folder. The one with the `.less` files sources.\nAll Sass users are not using Compass (have a look at bourbon.io) nor any dependencies managers in their project. So it will be handy if they could have access to the sources (the `.scss` files!) without having to get it from the gem.\nThat's how lots of users do (using source `.less` files manually) it would be great to be able to do the same with Sass version.\n They're here > https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/tree/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets\n\nIt's a non-intuitive location, but it makes our rails integration work.\n Great! How I missed it!\n\nI think It would be a good help for people migrating from a Less workflow (maybe you should notice this in the readme).\n\nThanks!\n @glebm Thanks for that info! I'll look into connect-assets, but first I'll try to get bootstrap-sass 3.1 working with Grunt.\n\nAs a funny side note, I try to read bundler but I keep reading blunder ;)\n\nRegards!\n Thanks for that link, much appreciated!\n I am wondering how to set it up into existing project.\nI tried bundle exec compass install bootstrap. Then, after checking this thread, I tried just compass install bootstrap, but it didn`t work.\nThe error tells \"No such framework: \"bootstrap\". \n\nI am able to create a new one using the command available on the documentation (removing the bundler exec).\n\nMy next step is just copy and paste it in my existing project. But first, I am just checking if there is a better way to do it. Is there!?\n\nThanks in advance!\n The instructions in the [README](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/README.md#b-compass-without-rails) say:\n\n``` Bash:\ncompass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\n```\n\nThis should work for you. It works for me.\n\nCompass will create a `config.rb` file in the `my-new-project` folder, which you can adjust to your liking (e.g. I prefer `css`, `js`, `img` to the long default directory names). You should put all those files under version control.\n- The files under `sass` are meant to be edited by you,\n- the other folders will hold the files generated by Compass / Sass (scss). Refer to those in your project.\n Thanks for the answer!\nBut in the documentation, this is for creating a new project.\nI did it just for testing and it worked to me as well.\n\nBut in my case, I am trying the previous approach, for a existing project.\n#contrib.rb\nrequire 'bootstrap-sass'\n\nbundle exec compass install bootstrap (and I tried without the bundle exec as well).\nAt this point I receive the \"No such framework: \"bootstrap\" error...\n I'm trying to **integrate JavaScript creation** (combine + minify using [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/)) **into Compass** by adding it to the `config.rb` file of the Compass project. The idea is to have a single CSS file and a single JS file created with a single call to `compass compile`. Somewhat an extension to [b. Compass without Rails](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#b-compass-without-rails).\n\n## How it works\n\nA [javascript.rb](https://gist.github.com/bittner/9929210) file (this is a Gist) sits in the Compass project folder next to `config.rb`, which includes it using `eval` (require/load fail for the variables). The file is self-explaining, run it and it tells you what to do; a TODO list is included (because it's a draft).\n\nI'm not a Ruby pro though (more a Pythonista), hence I have some questions:\n1. Is there a built-in (Ruby) way to determine the vendor assets location (in order to find the installed Bootstrap JavaScript files)?\n2. I guess I can include [bootstrap.js](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js) into the Compass project the same way I include `bootstrap.scss` in order to customize which of Bootstrap's JavaScript files to include for generation. Is there a (Ruby) way to directly use those values then, without opting for parsing that file (in order to figure out which files to include for generation)?\n Thanks to @thomas-mcdonald which gave an immediate solution to the problem. \nI continue to google to understands better the exact root cause and found this article [manage compass with bundler](http://atendesigngroup.com/blog/managing-compass-extensions-bundler). \n\nFor completeness I attached a simple Gemfile which I used and successfully run the bundler exec\n\n```\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\n\ngem 'sass', \"3.2.19\"\ngem 'compass', \"0.12.5\"\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.1.1'\n```\n\nI am a total beginner in this, you are welcome to add on to it. \nI would suggest to give an example of Gemfile in the documents, so it would speed up the set up of bootstrap-sass, especially for beginner. \n  In normal bootstrap, I can do td class=\"danger\" (or \"success\", etc.) to change the background color of a particular row. This appears to be missing here. Thanks.\n There was an upstream issue in v3.0.3 that screwed this up, but it's since been fixed in the main repo's master branch. It'll be fixed here when we launch v3.1.\n  I just updated today and I noticed that my dropdown in my navbar that floats right got moved to the edge. It looks really bad. It used to look like this\n![fixed](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1350444/1797220/e91480f4-6abf-11e3-81ad-fe4839766177.PNG)\nAnd now looks like this.\n![broke](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1350444/1797219/e4f5d9f0-6abf-11e3-822b-ae5566328df4.PNG)\n\nThere are two things I have found that fixes it but I don;t think they are the correct ways.\nIn this piece of css if i turn off the padding-right, it is fixed.\n\n```\n.navbar-fixed-top .navbar-collapse, .navbar-static-top .navbar-collapse, .navbar-fixed-bottom .navbar-collapse {\n    padding-left: 0;\n    padding-right: 0; }\n```\n\nOr in this piece if i turn off the margin-right.\n\n```\n.navbar-nav.navbar-right:last-child {\n    margin-right: -15px; }\n```\n\nSo what's the deal? Should there be another selector like .navbar-nav.navbar-right:last-child.dropdown{margin-right:0}? Because I know that if the last right child isn't a dropdown it needs that.\n\nOr why does everything in a fixed-top collapsable navbar inherit padding-right:0?\n That is what I currently have\n Ok I'll do that. I did try pulling old commits from here and that didn't fix it either. I wonder if it could be something else that I updated that did this. I just did bundle update and it did a couple things. Doesn't seem likely though \n I just looked over there and someone referenced me to a thread where someone else was having that issue. Apparently you now need to surround your stuff thats in the navbar in a `<div class=\"container\">` or in my case, a `<div class=\"container-fluid\">`.\n Yup, containers are required and we did a bad job of noting that in our docs. It's been updated in v3.1.0.\n  Now that things are official :ring:, let's talk about how best to talk about the Sass version of Bootstrap in our documentation. I've already got a callout on the updated homepage I'm working on for v3.1, but we'll likely want to blow that out into full fledged content.\n\nMy first thought is to add a section to the Getting Started or CSS page with essentially the contents of the current readme. The readme would then change to be more support information\u2014relationship with the @twbs/bootstrap repo, where to find docs, who's working on it, filing issues and feature requests, etc.\n\nI added a \"Using LESS\" section to the CSS page for 3.1. (currently in `master`). We don't have to make the two sections match in content or format\u2014just mentioning it for context.\n\nThoughts @twbs/sass?\n > One idea would be to provide a language switcher for the code snippets (LESS, Sass, Scss, CSS, CoffeeScript ?). I've outlined the idea in #447, now this could be done as part of twbs/bootstrap build process.\n\nDig that. Related, I want to implement a copy-paste function for all our code snippets (currently over 200 of them).\n\n> Perhaps we could link from the CSS page to this repo for now?\n\nI'd love to give the project more attention than just a link :). A more blown out section explaining the project, it's development, team, and, most importantly, it's usage.\n Decided to bump on the copy-pasta of your readme here to our docs. Too much crap to maintain across repos, especially since our docs are currently in HTML (and not Markdown).\n  Hey I tried the bower package. The packages got downloaded successfully. However the compilation from scss to css failed.\n\nThe reason was that the imports in stylesheets/bootstrap/bootstrap.scss wre all relative in the form of - \n\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\";\n\nwhereas _variables.scss is in the same folder. When I changed the above to -\n\n@import \"variables\"; the compilation started working. \n\nEither I am doing something completely  wrong, or the compilation is failing for everyone ! \n Have you updated the bower package ? It is still pulling in the old file.\n The above doesnt work. I tried the above verbatim and it was not able to resolve it. Maybe I am making some stupid mistake. Can you provide me the command again ? \n This works perfect for me. Nice!\nWhat name will you use to register on Bower, though? Most variations of \"bootstrap-sass\" have already been taken..\n  I'm using this in a Rails app being served from a subdirectory, e.g.\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.com/sub/\n```\n\nThe font paths are being served as\n\n```\nurl(\"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons...\n```\n\nwhere they should be, of course:\n\n```\nurl(\"/sub/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons...\n```\n\nThe CSS and JS assets are being served fine. I'm using Apache + Passenger and have a `PassengerBaseURI /sub` directive in the site config file.\n\nI'm not sure why it's working for CSS and JS but not the fonts. I'm `@include`'ing the bootstrap CSS as recommended.\n\nAlso, here's the stackoverflow I started for this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20686386/rails-bootstrap-font-path-not-including-base-uri-production\n\nSorry if this is not as detailed as it should be, still trying to figure out where this could be coming from.\n Fixed! Thanks for pointing me to #443. This was the config that did it:\n\n`config.action_controller.relative_url_root = '/sub'`\n\nNot sure why the other assets had the correct path, but there you have it. Thanks!\n  In `_glyphicons.scss` you have created links to the fonts. Unhappily, when I run `rake assets:precompile` in rails 4, the url links in `application.<md5-hash>.css` do not contain the md5 hashes that are added by the `rake` command\n\nAny ideas of the problem?\n I have to run precompile before i push staging to heroku (see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails-asset-pipeline). for some reason the url helpers in _glyphicons.scss are not adding the md5 hash -- that should be a problem with bootstrap-sass, right?\n user-env-compile worked! thanks glebm!\n  I'm not sure what's causing this, but when I use the default instructions from the `install` section, importing Bootstrap takes a considerable amount of time to compile and often I can't load the page on the first attempt before it times out. \n\nI'm running Rack Mini Profiler, and it tells me that the pages attempts to load for about 70 seconds before it quits and I'm brought to a page without styles. If I wait and then reload, the `application.css` file will eventually compile with the Bootstrap styles.\n\nAre there any known bugs causing extremely long compilation times, or should it complete relatively quickly?\n Are there any ways I can see what's causing the compilation to be as slow as it is on my server? I thought it might be an issue with the directories, so I did an `@import 'bootstrap/bootstrap` but that didn't fix the issue. I've looked at `application.css` in the browser while it's compiling, and it seems to get stuck at one or two places consistently. \n It turns out that the issue was with another part of my application, but it was causing `bootstrap` to compile very slowly. Sorry for the issue!\n  Hi there,\n\nSorry if my question is stupid, I am new working with bootstrap, and unfortunately on one of the first things I tried to do I stumbled upon a bug on bootstrap3 that was documented here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/11041\n\nNow obviously I understand that it may take some time for those bug fixes to trickle back down to this gem. But just to be sure I would like to know if there are any way to know if those fix (merge 9 days ago apparently) have made it back to bootstrap-sass, is there any sort of version I could check ? Maybe a way to live on the edge ?\n\nThx.\n Check out the README which explains how to keep bootstrap-sass in sync with upstream changes from Bootstrap.\n[Upstream Converter](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#upstream-converter)\n  I ran ``gem update` and then created a new project with `compass create my-new-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap`. I overwrote my old files with these new ones and the icons appeared broken. If i replace the fonts with the raw fonts from assets folder on git, the icons work fine. Filesize of ttf font in the compass project is like 3KB, old ttf file had like 29KB and the raw from git has like 41KB. So I guess this 3KB ttf file is somehow broken.\n  Howdy!\n\nWe've been talking on and off over email\u2014well, @thomas-mcdonald and I have at least\u2014but never finalized things. You still on board with porting this over to the @twbs org as the official Sass port? The people definitely want it, and if possible I'd like to give it to them for our next release, v3.1.0 (coming January).\n\n<3\n Oh snap! :revolving_hearts:\n\n> I see you have a Github Staff badge :)\n\nYup! I can help at any point with information, but the repo owners are responsible for any transfers (under repository Settings).\n I'm excited! @thomas-mcdonald will have to do it I think. I don't have ownership here either.\n :sunglasses:\n\n---\n\nShould I push it now or closer to 3.1? Will have to wait until after football now!\n  I need some extra permissions on the other side to change ownership :rowboat:\n Sorry, on it @thomas-mcdonald.\n @thomas-mcdonald Just added you as an Owner on @twbs. Should be sufficient.\n :+1: love to see the Sass port becomes official :heart: \n :+1: Great stuff!\n Need anything else from our end, @thomas-mcdonald or @glebm? Should be good to move whenever you're ready <3.\n :+1: \n insert ron paul \"it's happening\" gif.\n :clap: :+1: \n I think I need to set up permissions for you guys - @mdo did create a sass team but it doesn't seem to be listed anymore.\n :thumbsup: :cocktail:\n Woohoo! :water_buffalo: \n @thomas-mcdonald I think we're set on the team unless there was someone I didn't add, but @twbs/sass shows four members.\n  I had to create a team, you can probably view it in the security logs.\n Wooorrrddd. Swear I had done it. Either way, welcome aboard <3.\n  If $icon-font-path starts from \"/\" then it's include whole \"url('..')\" string as path.\n\nExample result:\n\n``` css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Glyphicons Halflings';\n  src: url(\"url(/css/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot)\");\n```\n OS X Mavericks, rvm (ruby-2.0.0-p353), Compass 0.12.2\nconfig.rb:\n\n```\nhttp_path = \"/\"\ncss_dir = \"www/css\"\nsass_dir = \"sass\"\nimages_dir = \"www/img\"\njavascripts_dir = \"www/js\"\n```\n\nIt's happens if $icon-font-path variable will be changed and new value starting from '/'\n Even without trailing slash, it does not work. If I leave $icon-font-path blank, it seems to set a default path from somewhere else: \n\nFor example, \n\nUsing <code>$icon-font-path: \"\";</code>\nGives this in the CSS file: <code>\"/css/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"</code>\n\nUsing: <code>$icon-font-path: \"css/\";</code>\nGives this in the CSS file: <code>\"/css/fonts/css/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"</code>\n\nUnless I have something wrong with my local install, but I have reinstalled both compass, rails and sass-bootstrap.\n As I mentioned elsewhere - I punted on this whole glyphicons drama and went to FontAwesome (https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails).  It's not an answer to this issue, but it's trivial and it rocks.\n I would just have prefered to be able to specify font locations for example as:\n\n<code>\"/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\"</code>\n\nI'll use the fonts_dir instead which does what i want, thanks for the tip. (I'm new to compass)\n What is a right way to use bootstrap-sass fonts with compass?

On iterating through the bootstrap assets **alerts.scss** is the first scss it comes across. However this scss does not include the **variables.scss** (for all declared variables) for compilation since it may not have been intended to compile down as a separate css. you might want to change the **config.assets.precompile** to add additional files. You can find more information at the stackoverflow link [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9915950/bootstrap-sass-undefined-variable-baselineheight)\n @ajeeshpu thank you. That was correct. Changed css to scss in config.assets.precompile line and it works like a charm now ;)\n  ```\nbower install twitter-bootstrap-sass\n```\n\ncurrently downloads Bootstrap 2.

I don't think so. PR welcome\n @AlJohri : that project is managed by jlong just as it says not by this group of folks\n @jrobeson, @glebm \"twitter-bootstrap-sass\" links to THIS repository. \n\nThis can be verified here: http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/#!/search/twitter-bootstrap-sass (takes a second to load) or view the output of bower info below:\n\n```\n\u279c  ~  bower info twitter-bootstrap-sass\nbower twitter-bootstrap-sass#*  cached git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git#2.0.3\nbower twitter-bootstrap-sass#*  validate 2.0.3 against git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git#*\n\n{\n  name: 'twitter-bootstrap-sass',\n  homepage: 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass',\n  version: '2.0.3'\n}\n```\n\nThere must be a <strong>valid manifest JSON (bower.json I presume)</strong> in the current working directory according to http://bower.io/#registering-packages <strong>so I'm confused as to how this currently exists</strong>.\n\nAll renaming of bower packages is done in this github issue: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120\n\n```\n\u279c  ~  bower search bootstrap | grep jlong\n    sass-bootstrap git://github.com/jlong/sass-bootstrap.git\n    bootstrap-sass git://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap\n\u279c  ~  bower search bootstrap | grep thomas\n    twitter-bootstrap-sass git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git\n```\n\nThe \"bootstrap-sass\" package points to a renamed github repo by jlong. I can request to deregister this package and redirect to this version with your permission!\n the opposite naming of bootstrap-sass vs sass-bootstrap is why i thought so.\n Hi @AlJohri! It would be great if you add a valid bower.json file to this repo! bootstrap-sass only works with ruby for now, but that should change soon https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/473\n @AlJohri @glebm Bower is actually looking at this repo's tags to generate the available version numbers. Unfortunately, when the tags changed to add an additional dot-number, i.e. the `vN.N.N.N` format rather than `vN.N.N`, it broke the way Bower parses them. So `v2.0.3` is the last available version that Bower sees.\n\nThe ideal fix would be to simply change the version tags to something [semver](http://semver.org/), which is what Bower prefers. Then you wouldn't even need a manifest file. It would just work.\n Good points, and good question. What about a new, additional tag that follows semver, but is intended only for Bower consumption? E.g. something like `v3.0.2-bower`. Perhaps `v3.0.2-bower.1`, `v3.0.2-bower.2` to capture that last `.N` somehow. (The importance [and formatting] of that is debatable, IMO.)\n\nIt's also worth noting that a user can just force-install a specific tag/SHA like so:\n\n```\nbower install '<git-url>#<git-tag-or-sha>'\n```\n\n(This solved the issue for me.)\n\nI think it's a question for @glebm, et. all, how important Bower support is vs. the extra effort it will take to implement an additional tagging scheme and/or create & maintain a package file.\n I don't really know if it's 'fixing' semver, given we're not following it. I think @mdo wants us to move to being pegged to upstream's releases, which is fine, we could retain the .z for Rubygems though?\n  Let me preface with the usual \"Forgive me if I'm a n00b.\"\n\nGem: gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.0.0.0.rc'\n\nI'm trying to do this:\nhttp://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem\n\nThe .spanX code doesnt seem to exist anymore.\n\nIt does exist in 2.0 branches, but I'm not sure if I should be going back that far.\n\nThis may be a duplicate of a recent issue:\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/issues/454\n\nRegards,\nMike Ribbons\n Thanks :)\n  I've noticed that there's no Opera 11.10+ support for css gradients. Would it make sense to submit a pull request to add in this support, or is this not kosher because this project is a SASS port of bootstrap?\n  There are a few changes in the final bootstrap 3 release, such as button gradients being removed. Would be nice to pull these in.\n  Hey guys,\n\nI'm installed the `v3.0rc` release onto a new blog and was attempting to set the values for `$navbar-default-link-color` and `$navbar-default-link-hover-color` to `#f00`. \n\nUnfortunately, upon compilation, these changes are not reflected. For other variables, like `$brand-primary`, my changes will be reflected.\n  In rails 4 when I try to require just bootstrap/modal inside of application.js\n\nI get `Internal Server Error couldn't find file \"bootstrap/modal\"` similarly, if I require all three files like in the example I get the same error, but for scrollspy since it's being required first. \n\n```\n//= require bootstrap/scrollspy\n//= require bootstrap/modal\n//= require bootstrap/dropdown\n```\n\nRequiring all of bootstrap does work, but I would like to isolate the requires to just the components that I need.\n Thanks! :smile: \n  If you try to  `File.read` from the erb template, then it will use the relative path from where you're parsing the template, not the relative path from the repo. Because the file that needs to be created isn't there yet (obviously), it throws an error of `File not found`. So copying the file from the relative path needs to happen in the manifest.\n Relevant bit of Compass Extensions documentation:\n\n> ERB Processing - This can be used to customize the contents of the file in an extension template. **The template will be processed in the context of a TemplateContext instance**, which gives you access to the full project configuration information as well as the command line options. Since it's unlikely many templates will need this functionality, I leave it as an exercise of the user to figure it out and if they can't to contact the compass-devs mailing list for assistance.\n Great to hear it's fixed, I didn't know how to get the variables in the template (Compass docs was a bit sparse on that subject).\n  I'm new to RoR so please bear with me.

I was referring to non-Rails platforms, where `font-url()` is not going to be defined, and it is more likely that the asset location is going to be different.\n\nIf we set a variable `$font-url: true !default`, and then define a variable for each font type as something like (syntax probably wrong):\n\n``` scss\n$font-path-eot: @if($font-url) { font-url(path/name.eot) } @else { url('path/name.eot') }\n```\n\nThen those not using the pipeline set `$font-url` to be false (maybe this would be better as $pipeline) and then overwrite the `$icon-font-path` & `$icon-font-name` to the correct asset location.\n I tried this in https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/473 with more explicit varname.\n this is basically fixed with that\n  Why the CoffeeScript conversion?\n/cc @fat\n Oh, please don't convert the JavaScript to CoffeeScript.\n A side-by-side JS/Coffee view might be good (even in upstream), but I can also see how the examples are probably simplistic enough that any benefits would be minor.\n > A side-by-side JS/Coffee view might be good\n\nI agree with a side-by-side, if CoffeeScript is included at all. JavaScript should definitely be there: not everyone is using CoffeeScript. Furthermore, those who are using CoffeeScript I would assume are familiar enough and used to seeing JavaScript such that they how to convert it to CoffeeScript on their own.\n closing otherwise this issue might end up like [this](http://discuss.atom.io/t/why-coffeescript/131) :relieved:\n  looks good.

Added an example where we redefined a variable value. And define a variable in terms of another variable.\n Thanks :-)\n  I am curious about how to use this gem to introduce bootstrap 3 into my application. I have installed this gem, and in basic testing it appears it introduction bootstrap 2.3.2\n\nApologies if this is not the appropriate place for this question.\n Use the 3 branch\n @sandelius how do I specify a branch from a gemfile? I did not know that was possible.. In a gemfile, I thought I could only specify the version of the gem to install into the application\n Add this to your gem file\n`gem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass'`\n\nThen run `bundle update` and then `rake tmp:clear`\n OK. is it ill advised to reference a github branch in a production application? I assume that a version of bootstrap-sass pushed to rubygems (or another repo) would be a stable release, but I wonder if the \"3\" branch is a development branch and, as such, is unstable.\n\nAre there plans of pushing bootstrap 3 into the main release of this gem?\n\nthanks @sandelius \n No not really. I'm using it in production right now and as soon it releases I just update my Gemfile. It works great.\n Why isn't there a v3 gem to install easily? I, too, would prefer not to directly reference the Github source.\n You could always fork it yourself and reference your own version.\n It will come soon. There's no difference really as long as it's tested. Use the master branch and not the 3 branch to be sure.\n @sandelius you're the only guy that said to use it in production. Is it stable?\n We're not quite in production - and we're on the 3 branch - we're pretty happy.\n We successfully use the master branch (specifically e21b64bb2791f8f564b5ae33c77ecc4e4447c0d0) in production (low-traffic, new project) on [Zuigo](http://zuigo.com/en/madrid).\n @emaiax Yeah it's stable.\n Marvelous! Tks a lot!\n\n> On 22/09/2013, at 14:48, Tobias Sandelius notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> @emaiax Yeah it's stable.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n Is there any reason why version 3 isn't on rubygems.org?\n One (small) glitch with the referencing this version from Github, you can't use it in a production engine. Gemspecs can't define gem dependencies from git repositories.  You can use if for development by adding it to the Gemfile of the engine, but that is not used once you add it to a parent application.  Just FYI.\n When are you planning to add it to rubygems.org?\n @sandelius \ni am new to ruby gems. i have already installed bootstrap-sass gem using the command \"gem install bootstrap-sass\" then created a project using the command \"compass create compass-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\". Generated project was using bootstrap. it was generating files with older bootstrap framework.\nto use bootstrap 3, as you suggested, i created a empty gem file, added the line 'gem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass'', ran 'bundle update'. it updated successfull to sass(3.2.12) and bootstrap-sass(3.0.0.0).\nthen I ran 'rake tmp:clear'. it failed due to missing rake file. i am not sure how to create a rake file. Is this step mandatory?\nAfter this, projects generated using \"compass create compass-project -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\" are still using bootstrap version 2.3.2.\ncan you tell me, what i missed to do here.\nThanks for your help in advance.\n If the master branch is considered stable enough for production, why hasn't it been pushed to rubygems already?\n\nAs @pallan pointed out, a git branch can't be used in a gemspec. Which is how I would like to use it. It would be nice to see this pushed to rubygems soon.\n :+1: \n Can I just build the master with the same version number to keep dependencies intact?\n As I've mentioned, I just do\n\n```\n  gem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git', :branch => '3'\n```\n\nuntil they decide to update.\n If you're not already using it, you may want to use the master branch, not the '3' branch. '3' has already been merged and it looks like fixes will happen on master.\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :github => 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass'\n```\n @trisweb @thomas-mcdonald Any more detail available about why README from #436 says \"# Experimental Bootstrap 3.0 beta -- use at your own risk.\"? Are there any specific scenarios that are known to have problems or need more testing? Thanks!\n @billvieux, no, it just hasn't been released into the wild other than through git, so it hasn't been tested with enough users for me to call it anything other than beta. AFAIK there are no known issues. This notice should be temporary.\n\n@thomas-mcdonald, we should really just release the gem soon...\n Can you please release this the gem?\n I am guessing that @thomas-mcdonald is waiting to refactor based on code climate F score here: https://codeclimate.com/github/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/Converter , but I think that could be a point release. I'd vote for pushing it out in the meantime, at least as an -rc\n The converter is an internal dev helper and doesn't affect the output\nquality, which appears to be a perfect port. But yes, it would be nice to\nimprove. I believe he's trying to bulletproof the icon image-url first.\n\nI agree, at least an rc release would be good.\n Any news on a RC?\n Yeah, it's on rubygems as of a few minutes ago.\n\nSorry for dropping the ball (again) - I've moved back to uni and so the last few weeks have been pretty hectic for me.\n Congrats, and thanks!\n Great news! \n\nMy project still compiles to 2.3.2 after the update, but I guess this is a Compass issue. Is there a cache that need to be cleared somewhere to upgrade?\n Congrats and thanks @thomas-mcdonald!\n\n@tixz the gem is up as a release candidate right now. The specific version is 3.0.0.0.rc so rubygems considers this a pre-release gem and will still serve the 2.3.x version as the latest by default.  Set the version explicitly in your Gemfile to '=3.0.0.0.rc' to get the latest version.\n I have checked that the gem is the latest source, but it doesn't seem to \"recognise\" that\n is anyone else experiencing issues with `btn-navbar` or `nav-collapse`? i found this potentially-related [issue](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/issues/313) but it seems to be a few months old...\n  This was breaking my layout. I believe it was included by mistake.\n I am working in 3.0, but one of the old CSS files (namely, responsive.scss) is still present in the master branch (which is now 3.0) and is being included in my application.css, which breaks my layout.\n\nI believe someone accidentally merged 2.3.2. styles into the 3.0 release, or failed to remove them.\n    Added a dummy app and a test example\n\n```\nrake test TEST=test/pages_test.rb\nopen tmp/test_visit_root.png\n```\n\n/cc @thomas-mcdonald \n Yes. It does a full page visit in a headless browser (and takes a screenshot), it also verifies that JS compiles and produces no errors on load.\n For testing these files we can use `get` instead of visit.\n_upd_ `get` doesn't work (404)\n this seems to work for me:\n\n```\ndef test_get_assets\n  visit '/assets/application.js'\n  assert_equal 200, page.status_code\n\n  visit '/assets/application.css'\n  assert_equal 200, page.status_code\nend\n```\n we may need to `rm -rf test/dummy/tmp/cache` on `setup` if there are caching issues (i keep seeing them on rails 4)\n :shipit:\n  We want to remove the responsive feature. Is there a way to do it?\n For Bootstrap 3, see http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#disable-responsive.\n  Updated README to add instructions on glyphicon support as some people were having issues with it\n I mean, it is possible to re-instate the code that glebm removed on this commit: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/85c57b1ffbeca1c5e0e6bd3ae356be84f7dd0df7\n\nand just have users add in the font files.\n Glyphicons are back in twbs again, therefore we will implement it here eventually\n  :dollar: \n Thanks!\n  Hi.\n\nThe default line-height for buttons doesn't seem right to me. Buttons height is 33px but should be 34px.\n\nLine height is: `1.42857` but should be `1.428571429`. We're missing some decimals.\n @sandelius  I came to this issue today and found that we can config the sass number precision. may be this should be noted in the README :)\n\n``` ruby\n  ::Sass::Script::Number.precision = 10\n```\n You are an angel! :)\n Putting   `Sass::Script::Number.precision = 10` in my Rails application.rb fixed all line-heights for me.\n thanks. It worked for me as well...\n :+1: fix working here.\n\nWhat is the most effective way to deliver this though?  I'd hate to think every user needs to add this to their app.\n Very good solution! Thanks !!\n This fix is required for input groups and all buttons to display properly. This variable is being rounded to the default 5 decimals and causing display issues: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L51\n\n@thomas-mcdonald How would you like to add this fix to the project?\n This really needs to go into the docs of bootstrap sass, for those not using the gem.\n @coli is it not fixed?\n\ne: duh yes, of course. Back 4 months ago I think the only real way of using it was through the gem.\n This setting for the Sass number precision, where exactly do we set it when using the bower installation of bootstrap-sass, and how? As far as the package is concerned, all we get besides some informational files are the assets themselves in bower_components/bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets, but no configuration file of any kind.\n\nThe rest is just my Gruntfile with the compass target, but grunt-contrib-compass clearly states that not all compass options are exposed to grunt (and number precision certainly doesn't seem to be one of them). Do we need to shell out to a config.rb file using grunt-contrib-compass's \"config\" option, or something like that (e.g. the \"raw\" option)? In either case, what would be the configuration instruction syntax?\n\nOne suggestion is to make all this information a little bit clearer in bootstrap-sass' README file. I'd be happy to write a patch if I had the information at hand. Thanks!\n Hi @glebm!\n\nThanks for the pointer. That would be the equivalent of using the \"config\" option of grunt-contrib-compass and putting the same directive in a compass-config.rb file, or whatever, which seems a great deal cleaner to me.\n\nI'll try it and update this issue to let you know if it works, for documentation's sake, but... one tinni tiny little problem: how to easily tell off-hand if it worked? ;)\n  I have little knowledge of this, but is my assumption correct in that the image-path method and its return value is a rails-only thing? When running jammit through this after SASS does its thing, it complains a lot about image-path, and prevents the compiled, minified css from being generated. Once I removed these calls it was fine.\n\nIn addition - I wanted to just overload these config variables in my own app, so as to not touch the main codebase, but thanks to the !default, this was not possible.\n\nSo, 2 things:\n\n1) Can we either remove the image-path so this is not rails-specific or (better)\n2) Remove the !default at the end of all configuration settings\n\nCheers!\n  Hi,\nAfter adding 'bootstrap-sass' when I am trying to install it i.e by rails g bootstrap:install, I am getting following message.\n\"Could not find generator bootstrap:install\"\n\nAm I missing anything?\nThanks\nMy Gemfile below:\n\nsource 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'rails', '4.0.0'\ngem 'sqlite3'\ngem 'sass-rails', '~> 4.0.0'\ngem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'\ngem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.0.0'\ngem 'jquery-rails'\ngem 'turbolinks'\ngem 'jbuilder', '~> 1.2'\ngroup :doc do\n  gem 'sdoc', require: false\nend\ngem \"rspec-rails\", :group => [:development, :test]\ngem \"database_cleaner\",  :group => :test\ngem \"email_spec\", :group => :test\ngem \"cucumber-rails\", :group => :test, :require => false\ngem \"launchy\", :group => :test\ngem \"capybara\",  :group => :test\ngem \"factory_girl_rails\", :group => [:development, :test]\ngem \"devise\"\ngem \"quiet_assets\", :group => :development\ngem \"figaro\", \">= 0.5.3\"\ngem \"better_errors\", :group => :development\ngem \"binding_of_caller\", :group => :development\ngem 'bootstrap-sass'\n Thank you.\n  All upstream bootstrap links now point to the twbs/bootstrap repo.\n  `flatten_mixin` unwraps `#gradient { }`\n`parameterize_mixin_parent_selector` applies the `@mixin a($parent)` hack\netc\n\nnot sure if this is the right approach, but it is more flexible than patches\n\n/cc #329 @sporkd\n It is possible, `replace_rules` will replace a rule block matching regex at any depth.

Have you modified those variables at all?\n I can't speak for the OP but I'm experiencing something similar.\nGemfile:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git', :branch => '3'\ngem 'rails', '3.2.13'\ngem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'\n```\n\nI found that for version 3 I have to do:\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n/* this, below, was  news to me. */\n@import \"bootstrap/glyphicons\";\n```\n\nAnd then copy the glyphicon files to $APP_HOME/public/assets/*\n\nI know that's 'poor form', but once I directly included the glyphicons file I started getting these errors:\n\n```\nStarted GET \"/assets/glyphiconshalflings-regular.ttf\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2013-07-31 10:53:08 -0500\nServed asset /glyphiconshalflings-regular.ttf - 404 Not Found (5ms)\n\nActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] \"/assets/glyphiconshalflings-regular.ttf\"):\n  actionpack (3.2.13) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/debug_exceptions.rb:21:in `call'\n  actionpack (3.2.13) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb:56:in `call'\n  railties (3.2.13) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:32:in `call_app'\n  railties (3.2.13) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:16:in `block in call'\n  activesupport (3.2.13) lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb:22:in `tagged'\n  railties (3.2.13) lib/rails/rack/logger.rb:16:in `call'\n  actionpack (3.2.13) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/request_id.rb:22:in `call'\n  rack (1.4.5) lib/rack/methodoverride.rb:21:in `call'\n  rack (1.4.5) lib/rack/runtime.rb:17:in `call'\n  activesupport (3.2.13) lib/active_support/cache/strategy/local_cache.rb:72:in `call'\n  rack (1.4.5) lib/rack/lock.rb:15:in `call'\n  actionpack (3.2.13) lib/action_dispatch/middleware/static.rb:63:in `call'\n  railties (3.2.13) lib/rails/engine.rb:479:in `call'\n  railties (3.2.13) lib/rails/application.rb:223:in `call'\n  rack (1.4.5) lib/rack/content_length.rb:14:in `call'\n  railties (3.2.13) lib/rails/rack/log_tailer.rb:17:in `call'\n  rack (1.4.5) lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:59:in `service'\n  /home/matt/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:138:in `service'\n  /home/matt/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/httpserver.rb:94:in `run'\n  /home/matt/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p195/lib/ruby/2.0.0/webrick/server.rb:295:in `block in start_thread'\n\n\n  Rendered /home/matt/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p195/gems/actionpack-3.2.13/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/templates/rescues/routing_error.erb within rescues/layout (1.0ms)\n```\n\nOnce I completed this I had icons in my app again.\n I am also having this issue, but what mattraykowski has tried does not work for me. Adding `@import \"bootstrap/glyphicons\";` and the font files to /public/assets does nothing.\n\nGemfile:\n\n```\ngem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'\ngem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', branch: '3'\n```\n\nbootstrap_loader.css.scss:\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n```\n\nI have followed the instructions on the bootstrap glyphicons page - http://glyphicons.getbootstrap.com/ but when I try to use the icons they show up as ones that are completely different, they look nothing like the glyphicons, as if it was another font.\n\nAre we supposed to be doing anything extra to get icons working with bootstrap-sass?\n Put glyphicons under:\n\n`vendor/assets/fonts/` for font files\n`vendor/assets/stylesheets/` for CSS files\n\nRename `bootstrap-glyphicons.css` to `bootstrap-glyphicons.css.scss` and wrap all font references with `font-url` and the correct url:\n\n```\nsrc:url('../fonts/glyphiconshalflings-regular.eot')\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nsrc:font-url('glyphiconshalflings-regular.eot');\n```\n\nImport the CSS file in your application SASS file:\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap-glyphicons\"\n```\n\n---\n\nI [removed](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/85c57b1ffbeca1c5e0e6bd3ae356be84f7dd0df7) glyphicons.scss from bootstrap-sass as icons are no longer a part of twbs/bootstrap (and are not pulled or converted automatically). The file was likely out of date and the font files are not in the repository.\n Awesome, the icons now work after following your steps. I also got it to work in Rails 3 by adding the font files and `bootstrap-glyphicons.css.scss` stylesheet to `app/assets/fonts/` and `app/assets/stylesheets`. Of course, I needed to change the font references in the stylesheet as well. I also didn't need to add the `@import \"bootstrap-glyphicons;` since the assets pipeline picks up the stylesheet automatically.\n\nPerhaps we can add instructions on how to add glyphicon support to the repo's readme? I can do this if so, I'm trying to get started contributing to open source anyways :]\n Glyphicons also broken for me. Using Ruby 2.0,  'rails', '4.0.0', 'sass-rails', '~> 4.0.0', 'bootstrap-sass'\n Glyphicons are not included with bootstrap 3. Follow the steps above. \n I'm not using bootstrap 3, although I haven't your fix yet. I have tried others.\n I was also having the issue with Rails 4.0.0 and bootstrap 2.x.\n\nThe issues was that no matter what I tried, the css files was never compiled to include the digest at the end. I tried a lot of items, but in the end it was a deployment mistake on my part.\n\nThe solution is fairly simple. All you need to do is compile your assets for the production environment so they include digest values. I ran the line below then restarted the application and it worked.\n\nRAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile\n Ahh! That fixed it, @joffems, thank you so much. I'm still learning a lot. Is this something new with Rails 4? I don't recall having to do this about a year ago on rails 3.2\n @jziggas, no problem. Yes, this is is happening, because Rails 4.0 no longer live compiles assets which is why you didn't notice it before. For more details you can read Railscasts #415.\n\n@muhammadn, did this solve your issue? If so, we can close this out. If not, please provide more details.\n Is there an unminified sass version of bootstrap-glyphicons.css?\n @AlJohri https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/85c57b1ffbeca1c5e0e6bd3ae356be84f7dd0df7\n I'm using Rails 3.2.13 and bootstrap-sass 2.3.2.1.\n\nI see the glyphicons locally but not in production. I'm eager to implement @glebm's procedure outlined above, but I don't know where to find bootstrap-glyphicons.css. I'm coming from an older version of the Rails Tutorial and so I'm struggling to understand implementation details for bootstrap now that the glyphicons are no longer included.\n\nWhich files should I be putting in vendor/assets/fonts and vendor/assets/stylesheets and where should I get them from?\n\nI currently have my @import \"bootstrap\" directive sitting in my custom.css.scss file, but in application.css I have just the usual sprockets require statements.\n\nSome blog posts and SO questions I've come across make reference to an overrides file and some $variables for glyphicon location. Should I be using those?\n\nThanks very much,\n\nDean Richardson\n @hikari17 Glyphicons are now back to twbs/bootstrap and bootstrap-sass 3. They are part of `@import \"bootstrap\"`.\n So I need to change the bootstrap-sass line in my Gemfile to:\n\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git', :branch => '3'\n\ninstead of:\n\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', '2.3.2.1'\n\nand that will take care of the issue? Or do I need to use the \"convert\" process you describe in the readme?\n\nThanks,\n\nDean\n @hikari17 - `gem 'bootstrap-sass', :github => 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass` should suffice -- 3 is on the master branch, but not yet released as a packaged gem.\n Tristin:\n\nWhen I make this change, and cap deploy, I get an error message from my production server:\n\ngit://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git (at master) is not checked out. Please run \u2018bundle install\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m still pretty new to Rails and to utilizing an edge version of a gem from a github repository. Can you advise me how to proceed?\n\nThanks,\n\nDean\n @hikari17 No worries. You should run `bundle install` on the server. Not sure how you'd execute that for your particular setup, but that's what's needed as it says.\n Tristan:\n\nThe issue for me there is that the deploy failed, so the Gemfile hasn\u2019t successfully been updated. I can run\n\n$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle install\n\nBut nothing new is installed, since the Gemfile is still the old one.\n\nThe way I\u2019ve dealt with this in the past is just to manually gem install the gems I need, then cap deploy finds them and everything works.\n\nThat\u2019s obviously a dumb way to deal with the issue, but there\u2019s some history behind it. I\u2019ve had a ton of problems with Capistrano in the past because I\u2019m deploying from a windows laptop to an Ubuntu server that\u2019s behind a firewall\u2026etc. and as a result I haven\u2019t been able to get my cap deploy script to automatically update my bundle during the deploy.\n\nSorry to bring my edge case to bear on what\u2019s apparently a fairly simple situation, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nDean\n\nFrom: Tristan Harward [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: Friday, September 20, 2013 4:37 PM\nTo: thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass\nCc: Richardson, Dean\nSubject: Re: [bootstrap-sass] No icons (#395)\n\n@hikari17https://github.com/hikari17 No worries.

It boiled down to my `bootstrap_and_override.css.scss` file (inherited from learning about this gem via [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/episodes/329-more-on-twitter-bootstrap)). I had:\n\n``` scss\n// Set the correct sprite paths\n$iconSpritePath: image-url('glyphicons-halflings.png');\n$iconWhiteSpritePath: image-url('glyphicons-halflings-white.png');\n```\n\nHad to do this with earlier versions of the gem, but in this one it caused invalid CSS to be generated:\n\n``` css\n  background-image: url(url(/assets/glyphicons-halflings-white.png)); }\n```\n\nI just removed those lines from my file and icons reappeared.\n\n``` scss\n// Set the correct sprite paths\n// $iconSpritePath: image-url('glyphicons-halflings.png');\n// $iconWhiteSpritePath: image-url('glyphicons-halflings-white.png');\n```\n\nMy 2c\n I finally managed to make progress on getting this gem downloaded to my production server through my firewall. I ran the bundle install command with the right http_proxy syntax and received an error message during the \"git clone\" step. This turned out to be another firewall issue. Trying the git clone with the https syntax was successful:\n\ngit clone 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git' \"...\" --bare --no-hardlinks\n\nNow I've apparently got some version of the gem in the following directory:\n\n~/.bundler/cache/git/bootstrap-sass-33efd...\n\nWhat do I need to do next to get this gem installed?\n\nThanks,\n\nDean\n I managed to get the bootstrap-sass 3.0.0 gem fully installed on my production server by adding back the require bundler/capistrano directive in deploy.rb and running cap deploy as usual.\n\nSo now my app is using the bootstrap-sass gem appropriately (I believe!) and I've updated my references to the glyphicons to include the proper classes for Bootstrap 3, e.g.:\n\n<i class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-share glyphicon-white\"> </i>\n\nBut alas, my buttons have white empty rectangles where the glyphicons should be. Is this an issue with the directory the glyphicons are stored in? Do I need some sort of bootstrap_overrides files to deal with this?\n\nThanks very much,\n\nDean\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/320244/1394217/0183c294-3c26-11e3-8ccf-1b161fcc5e22.png)\n It's not an answer, but I got so tired of the glyphicons drama that I decided to move to http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ .\n\nI haven't regretted it.\n\nKurt\n Man! Is that looking like a great option right about now!\n\nThanks,\n\nDean\n Alas, it's still a problem. I've got:\n\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap.sass.git'\n\nin my gemfile, and\n\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n\nin my application.css.scss file.\n\nAny further suggestions? Am I getting the latest version of the gem?\n\nThanks,\n\nDean\n @hikari17 there is a typo there, the repo is `bootstrap-sass`, not `bootstrap.sass`. \n Sorry... it's a typo in the post, but unfortunately, not in the gemfile. There the line actually reads:\n\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git'\n\n--Dean\n What is the exact error message you are getting?\n\nDoes using this branch help?\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'https://github.com/glebm/bootstrap-sass'\n```\n\nFrom your previous messages 3 months ago it appears your deployment ruby/bundle configuration is subtly broken and bootstrap-sass error is likely a result of that.\n No error message, just a white rectangle where the glyphicon should be. I'll try that version and see what happens.\n\n--Dean\n Bummer. Managed to get glebm/bootstrap-sass installed on my production server through the firewall, and managed to get cap deploy to work, so that the Gemfile was updated appropriately with the glebm reference, but still no joy on seeing the icons.\n What does the URL that gives you 404 in the console look like? Could you also log Bootstrap::BOOTSTRAP_SHA in production to see if the right version of the gem is being used?\n Gleb:\n\nEmbarrasingly, I\u2019m not getting a 404 in the console for either the bootstrap-sass glyphicons or the font-awesome icons.

This pull request is specifically concerned with automating that process as much as possible to allow a much faster release cycle.\n\nUpstream changes to the Twitter Bootstrap project can now be pulled in using the `convert` rake task.\n\nHere's an example run that would pull down the `3.0.0-wip` branch from the official twitter/bootstrap repo:\n\n```\n% bundle exec rake 'convert[3.0.0-wip]'\n```\n\nThe latest converter script is located [here](https://github.com/intridea/bootstrap-sass/blob/3.0.0-wip/tasks/converter.rb) and does the following:\n- Converts upsteam bootstrap Less files to its matching Scss file.\n- Namespaces mixin names with `twbs-` prefix to avoid conflicts with other libs.\n- Copies all upstream javascripts into `vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap`\n- Generates a javascript manifest at `vendor/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js`\n- Copies all upstream font files into `vendor/assets/fonts`\n\nThis less to scss conversion is pretty good, but not perfect. So manual fixes to the resulting Scss will necessary for now. The current version has only been tested with the official twitter/bootstrap `3.0.0-wip` branch.\n\nSee [these github issues](https://github.com/intridea/bootstrap-sass/issues?labels=converter&state=open) tagged with `conversion` which track the current shortcomings of the conversion process.\n Cheers for the work on this. It looks very cool, but I imagine I'm not going to be able to go through this properly until next Friday at the earliest due to exams.\n\nFirst thought though (having glanced at the changelog) is that I hate the idea of `twbs-` prefixing everything, mostly because although (I guess, having never really used other mixin libraries) it will stop conflicts, it's going to make using the Boostrap mixins an absolute pain in the arse, and it breaks from our philosophy thus far of being as close to the less files as we can get.\n Sure @thomas-mcdonald. I did try and keep the prefix as short as possible, and `twbs` is the name of the soon-to-be migrated Github org account for bootstrap. (see: http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/12/10/bootstrap-3-plans).\n\nSo while I understand your prefix reluctance, my reasoning comes from the fact that you already made bootstrap-sass work so nicely with compass (as pointed out in the [readme](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#compass)). However, if you use it with compass you're already conflicting with multiple out of the box [compass mixins](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass) without even knowing it. I also believe you'd conflict with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) mixins if you use that.\n\nAlso, my understanding is that Bootstrap 3 is going to allow the option to use minimal styling (or flat UI). So using other sass libraries will probably be much more useful in the future. And I'd prefer to use 3rd party mixins for additional UI customization since many are designed better, and it will help prevent sites from looking like all the other bootstrap sites out there.\n\nIf you still disagree, I guess it would be pretty easy to remove the prefixes from the PR. But I think the minimal effort of adding a prefix is much less painful than having to maintain a separate fork to avoid conflicting with other libs.\n Thanks for the update! Given BS comes with mixins like `vertical-gradient`, it's nice that they are prefixed, but any library that relies on Bootstrap LESS mixins will be a bit harder to convert to use bootstrap-sass. If we want prefixes it would be better to raise an issue in twbs.\n @glebm Part of the problem is that Sass ans Less are not analogous with respect to how you use mixins. First of all, in Less you can overload mixins names by defining the same mixin with different arguments. So the chance of getting a conflict is reduced. Second, it's easier to define namespaced mixins in Less by doing something like:\n\n```\n.twbs {\n  .vertical-gradient() {...}\n  .horizontal-gradient() {...}\n}\n```\n\nSo while I agree that it would be nice if bootstrap itself would namespace their mixins in this way, it's probably never going to happen. That's because LESS does not have as much of a community of 3rd party mixin libaries (aside from bootstrap iteslf). So if you're using LESS, you're probably only using bootstrap mixins.\n\nBut for the sake of forward progress, I can move the prefixing out into another pull request so that it can be discussed in greater detail. Would that be helpful @thomas-mcdonald?\n Hi Peter, hopefully I'll get some time to have a look through this soon. I think I'd rather you split the prefix into another PR - I need to look into how Sass handles (or doesn't) conflicting mixins.\n @sporkd, we can use compass without prefix bootstrap mixins to avoid conflicts ?\n Have we at least checked in with the folks at https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap on what their plan for 3.0 is? I know they're WIP on a branch right now and having our own conversion would be fine, just checking for prudence.\n Gotcha, carry on.\n This looks pretty sound, thanks. I think moving the conversion in-project is probably a good idea.\n\nI'm going to merge this now but there's a few tweaks I'd like to look into w/ supporting multiple variables for some mixins.\n Also @sporkd, I added you as a contributor. Feel free to push directly to 3 if you have improvements to the converter.\n  The import paths in bootstrap.scss were broken, here is the fix.\n  Currently bootstrap-sass has a dependency on sass-rails ~> 3.2\n\nShould it allow >= 3.2 ?\n It has a development dependency on `~> 3.2` which needs updating, and the Readme needs updating, but aside from docs it does actually allow 4.0.0 and it works fine on Rails 4. :+1: \n @thomas-mcdonald Is that all that needs to be done to close this issue?\n\nI can submit a Pull Request for the 3 branch with a gemspec and README update to `>= 3.2`\n Every time I try to use bootstrap-sass on branch '3' with sass-rails 4.0.0.rc1 I can't import the bootstrap or twitter/bootstrap resource into my application.css.scss. Sprokets says things can't be found:\n\n``` console\nFile to import not found or unreadable: twitter/bootstrap.\nLoad paths:\n  /vagrant/focus/app/assets/javascripts\n  /vagrant/focus/app/assets/stylesheets\n  /vagrant/focus/vendor/assets/javascripts\n  /vagrant/focus/vendor/assets/stylesheets\n  /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327/gems/turbolinks-1.3.0/lib/assets/javascripts\n  /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327/gems/jquery-rails-3.0.4/vendor/assets/javascripts\n  (in /vagrant/focus/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss:16)\n```\n\nAny ideas?\n @toobulkeh Change the path to `@import 'bootstrap'`!\n I thought that was one of the many things I had tried. I'll submit a pull request for the docs to be updated!\n\nSubmitted https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/411\nThanks!\n  Hi all,\n\nI just installed the sass-boostrap gem in my rails4 project, I can see rounded corners in FF and Chorme but not in IE9, is that a common issue?\n\nThanks\n I double checked and Boostrap css on IE works well, I scare it has to do only with the gem.\n  Fixes #366\n\nFallback to old method of accessing the context object, and use the correct access method through the `:importer` key of the `options` hash, which is set on the context by Sass. The context is passed into the Engine (which is a Tilt::Template) and used as the _scope_ of the render method (see here: https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt/blob/master/lib/tilt/template.rb#L92) , which calls `evaluate(scope...)`. This is how the Sass engine gets access to the options hash to begin with, and how the options hash has the scope of the Context.\n\nIf you want to follow, look for how Engines are defined in Sprockets `sprockets.rb`, file types have engines defined by extension in `asset_attributes.rb`, which are then called in `context.rb` -- https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/blob/master/lib/sprockets/context.rb#L194 (that's where the scope is passed into the engine, and the context passed with it). The `importer` is added to the options hash when the import is parsed, by the `Sass::Importers::Filesystem` (which `Sprockets::SassImporter` extends) here: https://github.com/nex3/sass/blob/stable/lib/sass/importers/filesystem.rb#L181\n\nIn other words, this should be the correct way, and the context of the importer will always be the Sprockets context if used within Sprockets. Whew.\n\nThe new way is of course preferable since Sprockets > 2.10 adds a nice `:sprockets` hash to the options hash directly, so it's still worth it to use that if it exists.\n Whew, thanks @trisweb and @glebm and @thomas-mcdonald.

Unfortunately havent had time to probe this further\n This is my application.css.scss:\n\n``` scss\n/*\n * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files\n * listed below.navbar\n *\n * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,\n * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.\n *\n * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the\n * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.\n * Not= require leaflet/leaflet\n * = require fg.menu\n * = require jquery.Jcrop\n * = require leaflet/leaflet\n * = require leaflet/markercluster\n * = require leaflet/markercluster.default\n * = require jquery.tokeninput\n*/\n\n/* -------------------- START APPLICATION CSS -------------------- */\n\n@import \"compass/reset/utilities\";\n@import \"compass/css3/images\";\n@import 'compass/css3/box-sizing';\n@import \"compass/typography/links/link-colors\";\n@import \"compass/css3/border-radius\";\n```\n\nHowever I am using bootstrap only in our admin backend: which uses the file in the admin.css.scss in the stylesheet_link_tag - The first few lines of that are:\n\n``` scss\n/*\n *= require jquery.Jcrop\n *= require timePicker\n*/\n@import \"bootstrap_and_overrides\";\n\n\n$features-spacing: 10px;\n$icon-spacing: 10px;\n$flag_24-spacing: 10px;\n$admin-icon-spacing: 10px;\n@import \"icon/*.png\";\n@include all-icon-sprites;\n@import \"features/*.png\";\n@include all-features-sprites;\n@import \"flags_24/*.png\";\n@include all-flags_24-sprites;\n@import \"admin-icon/*.png\";\n```\n\nI would note that I use compass and as compass is not rails 4 ready I am using the following for my compass:\n\ngem 'compass-rails', github: 'milgner/compass-rails', ref: '1749c06f15dc4b058427e7969810457213647fb8'\n\nAs indicated everything works well using v2.3.1.0 just had this problem today when I did a bundle update and saw that it had updated the bootstrap gem, and I started getting the stylesheet_link_tag problem. I also tried a rake assets:precompile and it stalled on the admin.css.scss file. Hope this is helpful.\n    In my `marketing.css.scss` file I have the following:\n\n```\n ..snip..\n//override base font values;\n$sansFontFamily: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\n$baseFontSize: 14px;              //NOTE: THIS IS NOT WORKING\n$fontSizeLarge: 24px;              //NOTE: THIS IS NOT WORKING.\n$paddingLarge:          15px 50px;\n$headingsFontWeight:    normal;\n..snip..\n@import 'bootstrap';\n```\n\nUnfortunately, as I note above, any changes to the `fontSizeLarge` and `baseFontSize` variables do not seem to have any effect on the generated Bootstrap css file. \n I always have to make sure that the right controller is mapped to the corresponding layout (unless application wide) and the corresponding scss file. The arrangement of precedence matters. Just brainstorm some pointers\n Hi @theoptips, thanks for the help, but it is an application wide css file, with no other import statements. All my other variables work perfectly, that's what confuses me. I have checked to make sure the gem is updated as well:\n\n```\n gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2'\n gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.3.1.0'\n```\n marketing.css.scss shows me that it is a specific scss styling for views in the marketing controller\n\ncan you check your view/layout file? marketing.html.erb? If stylesheet isn't linked to the corresponding scss file, styling won't take effect. \n\n<%= stylesheet_link_tag    \"placeholder\" %>\n  <%= javascript_include_tag \"placeholder\" %>\n  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>\n</head>\n\nhttp://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#linking-to-css-files-with-the-stylesheet_link_tag\n\nGot an online repo to share? :3\n $baseFontSize works for me but not the others ($fontSizeLarge, $fontSizeSmall and $fontSizeMini)\n\n``` scss\n$baseFontSize: 10px;\n$fontSizeLarge: 13px;\n$fontSizeSmall: 14px;\n$fontSizeMini: 16px;\n\n@import 'bootstrap';\n\n.test {\n  font-size: $baseFontSize;  // 10px\n  font-size: $fontSizeLarge; // 12.5px (which is 10 * 1.25)\n  font-size: $fontSizeSmall; // 8.5px (10 * 0.85)\n  font-size: $fontSizeMini;  // 7.5px (10 * 0.75)\n}\n```\n\nThis error come from _bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss_\nThere's simply no !default for $fontSizeLarge, $fontSizeSmall and $fontSizeMini. (line 65, 66 and 67).\n  https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/86bb3b8126c94ee8c839eac4d9120f3edeafefdd\n  Regarding the note in the Readme about Semver: if you use build version syntax (2.3.1+1), you'll be compatible with Semver, and preserve honesty in versioning.\n I don't think I'm following you - if Bootstrap changes y or z (minor or patch versions), and we need to release multiple versions on top of that to address any problems, adding a +version will allow us to do so within the constraints of Semver.\n\nThe part of the version string that breaks Semver is the third dot delimiter. I'm only suggesting that we use a Semver-accepted delimiter before our \"patch\" version.\n First, I want to acknowledge that the + character doesn't do what I intended, because build metadata is supposed to be ignored in version precedence. The - character is a better fit (the pre-release designator). Both are not truly semantic, but appending our versioning onto another version system isn't exactly semantic anyhow.\n\nCurrently, sass-twitter-bootstrap has tags that look like 2.2.0.1 and 2.3.0.1. That's not legal in Semver, so it fails when used as a Bower component, for example. I'm suggesting that the version strings be 2.2.0-1 and 2.3.0-1. We'd follow Bootstrap's version numbers, continue to append our own versions as appropriate, but do so without breaking Semver.\n\nI'm more concerned with the letter of the law than its spirit (though both matter). If Twitter breaks the rules of Semver by changing the public API on a minor or patch version, there's not much we can do about that. However, we can control whether our versions actually validate as Semver or not, and that's what I'm recommending.\n  Glad to see a 3.0 branch! Where did _reset.scss go? I'm looking for to get this fix asap:\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/86bb3b8126c94ee8c839eac4d9120f3edeafefdd\n Got it. It looks like https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/86bb3b8126c94ee8c839eac4d9120f3edeafefdd isn't a part of this branch yet. I'd like to submit a pull request for taking out `width: auto\\9;` from /vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_reset.scss but I still don't see _reset.css in that folder despite that being in the traced style:\n\n```\n/* line 79, /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.1.0/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_reset.scss */\nimg {\n  /* Responsive images (ensure images don't scale beyond their parents) */\n  max-width: 100%;\n  /* Part 1: Set a maxium relative to the parent */\n  width: auto\\9;\n  /* IE7-8 need help adjusting responsive images */\n  height: auto;\n  /* Part 2: Scale the height according to the width, otherwise you get stretching */\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  border: 0;\n  -ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;\n}\n```\n Had to do this to make sass helpers work with master sprockets/rails: https://github.com/glebm/bootstrap-sass/commit/25399d4478b7fdf54a97a5021e7b39faae92ad74\n Hey! Just to know. In https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/pull/73 we now started the work on 3.0.0-wip for SASS\n I've updated the script (incl. patch) and pulled from `3.0.0-wip` here https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/368\n @m5o That's great, I've updated this repo's script to pull from `3.0.0-wip` branch and account for structural changes in that branch!\n Interesting, I wonder if we can provide multiple BS versions. One way to do this would be to set sass/javascript load paths in runtime, based on a setting e.g. `config.bootstrap_version`. \n Thought of another thing with the converter (which seems to be failing at the moment) to look into.\n\nI was originally against the idea of #393 but it would make configuring components much easier than at the moment, copying the bootstrap.scss file across always seemed a little hacky.\n Sorry to sound terribly ignorant, but I'm trying to move from Bootstrap 2 to Bootstrap 3, the docs aren't very clear and `rake -T` doesn't show the conversion rake task mentioned, nor does the upstream converter command on the readme work.  I'm at a loss on how to move my project to Bootstrap 3 from this gem.\n @GantMan The conversion task is for the gem's internal use -- it converts bootstrap LESS to SASS.\n\nYou can try it out with:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', git: 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', branch: '3'\n```\n\nand manually convert all your markup and customizations; note that bootstrap-sass support for this is still very alpha -- no stable release yet. \n @sporkd, I see, could you please push a fix -- I am not sure what the `$parent` hack refers to\nCould you also review my `converter:` commits? Thanks!\n At the moment there is a lot of manual patching that needs to happen after each `convert[]`.\nHow can we automate the converter further? \nIt'd be great if it is 100% like before, but it looks we will need some kind of patches. Formatting-insensitive search & replace patcher sounds good enough. What do you guys think? \n @m5o Just updated [sass-twitter-bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/tree/3.0.0-wip) to Bootstrap 3.0 RC1\n Awesome! Thanks for the heads up! I'll be rolling it into my project tonight!\n :+1: thanks for this!\n Getting close with the converter\n\n```\nrake convert[3.0.0-wip] && git diff --numstat\n```\n found a minor converter bug in `_forms.scss`: [Line 79-L80](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_forms.scss#L79-L80)\n\n`spin` should here not be converted to `adjust-hue`\n @m5o Thanks, fixed!\n Converter does everything at [this](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/d5ccfc897678e2e28d3856538c3ffb53131c2b10) point (i.e. `rake convert[3.0.0-wip]` gives empty diff)\nDoing structural transformations with regexes sucks but it kind of works with just a few `StringScanner` kludges (only when it's this simple)\n Dude, that's awesome. Nice work! Wasn't sure if we could ever get to 100%. Of course things could still change, but hopefully as 3.0 stabilizes, the converter shouldn't require too much tweaking.\n\nI was also thinking it would be nice if we had a test to compare the output css for equality with the official bootstrap.css. However this might be very difficult considering the various ways css can be output and still be equal in result. Perhaps something like Nokogiri could be useful.\n Yeah, hopefully it doesn't have too many different new things (some potential for bleeding edge).\nParsing CSS unfortunately can't be done with nokogiri (which only parses XML). There are some css parsing [gems](https://github.com/alexdunae/css_parser) though. A simple test we could add too is a bootstrap docs page in a headless browser and asserting equality of every DOM style property of every element VS the original bootstrap...\n Converter output now contains all the non-generic transformations (the new patches) applied, makes it really easy to see what it does now.\nI also discovered `convert_less_ampersand` doesn't affect the output. What does it do? Is it redundant?\n _improvement idea_\nI would suggest to use [Variable Arguments in SASS](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#variable_arguments) for the `box-shadow` and `transition` mixins. \nYou could also refactor the string interpolation for these two mixins, like [we did in our fork](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/pull/34/files) month ago.\n Hey guys, just had a quick question regarding using SASS Bootstrap 3. I've always used thomas-mcdonald's sass-bootstrap with my rails projects since it seems to be the defacto standard but I was curious as to what the differences are between this and \"jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap\" and \"alademann/sass-bootstrap\" versions.\n\nhttps://github.com/alademann/sass-bootstrap/\nhttps://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/tree/3.0.0-wip\n\nFrom what I can tell this version is the most maintained and closest conversion. Any other differences?\n @AlJohri I believe this is the only version that is converted 100% automatically (all the `rake convert[3.0.0-wip]` commits), which is why it is so up to date at the moment. You can look at the convert task output to see exactly which hacks are being applied to adjust for incompatibilities between LESS and SASS.\n @m5o @thomas-mcdonald thanks, added basic vararg mixins conversion in https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/466d5a3293bb02cda9e99d2afc616d7624ac5556!\n Just digging in the code at the moment, how close is the conversion to being complete?\nGreat work BTW!!\n @alex-m It is complete\n RC2 has been released! http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/08/13/bootstrap-3-rc2/\n Updated \n Im testing out branch 3. One thing I noticed is `.navbar-header` is as follows...\n\n```\n.navbar-header {\npadding-left: 0%;\npadding-right: 0%;\n}\n```\n\nBut on [the Bootstrap site](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) it is as follows...\n\n```\n.navbar-header {\npadding-right: 15px;\npadding-left: 15px;\n}\n```\n\nMaybe its user error, but I think I am doing everything right.\n @glebm, does your update also make it bootstrap 3 rc2 ready. thanks\n @glebm I'm wondering the same as @boy-jer. What kind of timing do you expect after the next release date, as well? I believe it's dropping tomorrow.\n @boy-jer @JoshSmith twbs/bootstrap commit sha is in [version.rb](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/lib/bootstrap-sass/version.rb#L3). Yes that is RC2+\nWork on next version is happening in `3-wip` branch, but it isn't ready yet\n Great. Thanks @glebm \n Can't wait. Hopefully Rail Admin will update after your pull ... spec.add_dependency 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.3'\n BS3 is Out ! http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2013/08/19/bootstrap-3-released/. Can't wait for your gem ! Thanks guys\n I have updated branch `3` and the converter with the latest twbs code. new `rake compile` task that generates `tmp/bootstrap.css` and `tmp/bootstrap-theme.css`.\nTests now also compile `theme`. Converter also _caches_ all downloads now (github won't block your IP when working on this anymore). \n\nGlyphicons were added back into twbs (ugh); done a bit of implementation, but someone else will have to look at what's missing (`font-url` helper for non-rails? `precompile` settings for rails 3/4?)\n/cc @sporkd @thomas-mcdonald \n\nYou can now `@import 'bootstrap/theme'` for button gradients and other \"theme\" stuff \n New Glyphicons are confirmed working on Rails\n\n[![They are back](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/982305/08e11178-07e1-11e3-8ddb-bf3a2810f921.jpg)](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/9767)\n\nThis still needs a custom helper for non-rails (PR welcome!).\n Do you mean something like this?\n\nin `variables`\n\n```\n// inject bootstrap-sass var\n$twbs-font-url-helper: font-url !default\n```\n\nin `glyphicons`\n\n```\nsrc: #{$twbs-font-url-helper}('#{$icon-font-path}#{$icon-font-name}.eot'); \n```\n I just tried the above in 2b717ee3d4c7db870073e7d51fc9c8c83d08999b but it doesn't work `Invalid CSS after \"... format('woff')\": expected \";\", was \",\"`\nThe branch is [`3-font-helper`](/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/tree/3-font-helper) if anyone knows a way to make it work.\n Turns out it is possible via [call](https://github.com/nex3/sass/pull/812) in sass 3.3 but not 3.2 [like this](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/68200eb7d6b81c5d6b014770cb48a952867b987e).\nPerhaps patching `call` in for older sass would be a good solution\n Glyphicons work fine in development but not in production. I get errors that look like:\n`ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] \"/assets/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular-24dfb40c91db789b8b8faba6886ac1ef.svg\")`\n after that last update, I can no longer set `$grid-gutter-width` to a percentage. \n\n```\nSyntax error: Incompatible units: '%' and 'px'.\n```\n @frabrunelle should be fixed with 0e8d41db36b41d0ffd37b6f1839b51d8e8d875d4\n\n@travisdahl you can try overriding [these variables](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss#L610-L620), but I don't think percentage gutter is generally supported by twbs\n Thanks @glebm, it works!\n Thanks @glebm , that's exactly what I had in my SASS file... `$grid-gutter-width:1%;` which did in fact work as of last week. Looks like until your last commit. I added a comment to [the commit](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/089174049c83b698b92f483aef146d0fd54efb9f). Thanks for all your hard work!\n See my comment above, if you want this changed you can raise issue with [twbs/bootstrap](/twbs/bootstrap).\n @glebm , ah I see. I'll report it over there! Sorry about that!\n It looks like the .navbar-collapse class stylings are missing from this branch.\n\nEdit: Nevermind, looks like another gem was conflicting with my attempt to use 3 and was causing all my problems\n With \"this is 3.0.1\" commit, does it mean the \"3\" branch is ready for production use and will be merge to master branch soon? @thomas-mcdonald @glebm If not, what's the schedule?\n @umhan35 It just means the commit corresponds to twbs/bootstrap 3.0.1 in progress (unreleased). Whether it's ready _for production_ is in the eye of the beholder: while it does appear to work just fine, we do not have any tests yet. See the checkboxes in the OP:  once they are all **\u221a** then we are close.\n A rough notion of schedule would be nice.  One of:\n- days\n- weeks\n- months\n\nwould be lovely.\n On https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/571ba865e1cd01f583c5949446803b9f2cd21926 : this commit incorporates some changes and deprecations from [BS3.0.1 ship list](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10050), it's not actually 3.0.1.\n @thomas-mcdonald OK, great. I can push further updates to a `bleeding-edge` branch (`latest`?). Then merge from that branch into `master` for releases. \n\n---\n\nIf you have been using this on the bleeding edge before the revert commit, the latest commit ref is:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', \n  git: 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', \n  ref: 'e21b64bb2791f8f564b5ae33c77ecc4e4447c0d0'\n```\n Hi,\n\nHope someone can help.. I am using bootstrap-sass but want to upgrade to bootstrap 3 before I continue on mainly doing work on the views. Rather than wait for this to be released, I was hoping I could switch to this branch.\n\nI have changed my Gemfile to point at branch 3 by doing:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', branch: '3'\n```\n\nAnd then ran bundle update and the gem has been updated, however nothing in the repo has changed. And running:\n\n```\nbundle exec rake convert\n```\n\nProduces an error: \n\n```\nDon't know how to build task 'convert'\n```\n\nCan someone let me know what I am missing, please.\n Sorry, my fault. When I was first trying it, I only did 'bundle' and not update. Then later I didn't restart the server!\n\nVery sorry, thanks for the reply and the hard work!\n I wanted to use bootstrap 3 with bootstrap-sass, couldn't get it even if update my gemfile with the following,\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', github: 'thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass', branch: '3'\n\ni want to start fresh and i only get 2.3.2. Please help me on the steps to get bootstrap 3 working with bootstrap-sass. \n Hi there. I've tried following the hints from bobbbie and still getting the \"Don't know how to build task 'convert'\" message. I do recon there's this script <a href=\"https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/3/tasks/converter.rb\">here</a> and wonder do I have to do something with it in order to get it work? Sorry I'm pretty new in Rails in general. Thanks! :)\n  Bootstrap 3.0 looks close. https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/6342\n upgrading will be a pain, but having 3.0 for new projects is good.\n We started using a pre-compiled customized version of BS3, we would love to get back to using SASS to customize it.  \n\nI would guess that a lot of projects will stay on BS 2.x for a while but since we're actively developing new UIs we wanted to go ahead and upgrade to 3.  \n  I get the following error when booting a Rails app that is implicitly pulling in bootstrap-sass from rails_admin.  I'm definitely using Rails... something to do with order of initialization, perhaps?\n\n```\n/Users/wlipa/.gem/ruby/1.9.1/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.1.0/lib/bootstrap-sass.rb:18:in `load!': bootstrap-sass requires either Rails > 3.1 or Compass, neither of which are loaded (Bootstrap::FrameworkNotFound)\n    from /Users/wlipa/.gem/ruby/1.9.1/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.1.0/lib/bootstrap-sass.rb:45:in `<top (required)>'\n    from /Users/wlipa/.gem/ruby/1.9.1/gems/activesupport-3.2.13/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:251:in `require'\n    ....\n```\n The above rails_admin bug was closed incorrectly, I believe.

Improve the load logic to take into account that Sprockets might be used without Rails. Simplify and DRY it up. It should have exactly the same effect as before, with the exception that `rails_functions.rb` is now only loaded if ::Rails is defined.\n2. Improve the `image_path` sass function to delegate to the Sprockets `image_path` directly if Sprockets is available. This is a near-direct copy of sprockets-sass' version here: https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-sass/blob/master/lib/sprockets/sass/functions.rb#L62 This covers Rails and Sprockets usage, while the next condition for Compass continues to cover Compass-only use. This fixes #257 - SystemStackError infinite loop when bootstrap-sass is included with Sprockets but not Rails.\n\nOverall this pull should make bootstrap-sass work with non-Rails installations that use Sprockets. I have also tested with our Rails app and all continues to work great, since the new `image_path` function is equivalent to the one sprockets-sass provides. There should be no conflict.\n\nI also made a quick Sprockets-Sass-Compass Rack (man that's a lot of buzzwords) test app here. It may be useful: https://github.com/trisweb/compass-test-app\n (Sorry submitted too early by mistake, revising description above)\n Excellent, thanks for the update. I'll watch for the other issue.\n  I spend 15 minutes before realizing that I need to restart the WEBrick server...  Maybe it's just me though.\n This is generally good practice after updating gems, and I agree it should be documented.\n  After the update, I have stopped showing up collapse button.\n\n![ Bug](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/78280/253693/d7fa5ce2-8bdd-11e2-8552-57843bd3ec65.png)\n\nThis issue seems very strange to me... although I'm not sure, maybe it's my fault, but I did everything, as stated in the documentation.\n I'm getting the same error.\n I can't tell what the issue is: I'd need to see a before-and-after.\n\nThe most likely explanation is that the classes or behavior has changed with the version bump: check out the [bootstrap docs](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and review your HTML to see if it still matches the spec.\n I found a problem: I imported the bootstrap-responsive BEFORE bootstrap.

We do not use this module, and it's conflicting with the `Sass` module in the global namespace. We still should have used `::Sass` to avoid any ambiguity; my bad on that.\n\nIs there a reason you're using both `bootsrap-sass` and `bootstrap-sass-rails`?

So I need a local override/monkey patch to fix this.\n\nThanks. Here is the issue: https://github.com/desandro/isotope/issues/335#issuecomment-11507013 and here: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/6541\n\nThe problem without this patch is that the awesome isotope library can't function properly as chrome and safari can't draw the images correctly.\n I posted the answer here: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/6541\n\nInlining this in the CSS worked, like this: \nimg src=\"blah-blah\" width=398 height=265 style=\"width:398px; height:265px\"\n\nIn fact, I also tested Isotope without using the width and height attributes, like this: \nimg src=\"blah-blah\" style=\"width:398px; height:265px\"\n\nAnd that worked fine! Any recommendation if it's better to only specify the CSS?\n\nI was able to very easily test this without bootstrap (or bootstrap 2.0) by using this CSS:\nimg {\nwidth: auto;\nheight: auto;\n}\n\nIt seems that the width and height in the CSS do override the image properties, and before the images get loaded, the browser does not know how much space to allocate, and then, even after the images load, the spacing is still wrong, at least with Isotope. Inlining the style does workaround the issue. I think I tried using regular styles, but that didn't seem to work, but I may have had a CSS priority issue. Any way, since the image size is laid out with the image properties, it's rather natural to put in this tiny bit of inline CSS. I hope we eventually find a better solution, as this will surely affect others when upgrading.\n\nOr at least this should be documented that one needs to use the inline style for the width and height of the image rather than the properties.\n  I have some modal windows in my Rails project. And I have a problem with background.\n\nGenerated HTML with duplicated background:\n\n```\n<div class=\"modal-backdrop fade in\"></div>\n<div class=\"modal-backdrop fade in\"></div>\n</body>\n```\n\nI don't know what's wrong.\n\nMy gems\n\n```\ngroup :assets do\n  gem 'sass-rails',   '3.2.5'\n  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.2' \n  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.2.6'\n\n  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.1.1.0'\nend\n```\n  Hello, I have been using bootstrap-sass with a few assets like login system and emailers.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that the divs intended to use for notice and alert with classes of the same name are always visible on screen, even when they are empty.

Thanks!\n  Is there a standalone `colors.scss` file that users can `@import` into application stylesheets as necessary? It would be great to have access to Bootstrap's default colors.\n Excellent, thank you!\n  Fix for #261\n  I have been collecting a list of licenses for a project I'm working on using [LicenceFinder](https://github.com/pivotal/LicenseFinder) and I noticed that bootstrap-sass doesn't include a license in it's gemspec. This is a small change which adds that in.\n I'm not really sure why the Travis build failed, I didn't think this change would break anything!\n Yeah looks like it just timed out. You should be able to go into Travis and re-run the build under the Settings (gear) icon in the top right.\n I don't seem to be able to re-run the build (I am new to Travis so I am\nprobably just looking in the wrong place).

I'm not sure why I couldn't see the rebuild button on Travis, maybe it's because I don't own the repo?\n  When I run:\n\n```\nrake assets:precompile\n```\n\nI get:\n\n```\nUnexpected token: operator (>) (line: 9903, col: 9, pos: 283961)\n\n     undefined\n     (in /Users/adamw/Projects/Github/counter/app/assets/javascripts/application.js)\n```\n\nMy Gemfile is\n\n```\ngem 'rails',          '~>3.2.9'\ngem 'sass-rails'\ngem 'bootstrap-sass'\ngem 'jquery-rails'\ngem 'sqlite3'\ngem 'sorted'\n\ngroup :assets do\n   gem 'compass'\n   gem 'compass-rails'\n   gem 'uglifier'\nend\n\ngroup :production do\n   gem 'passenger', '=3.0.18'\nend\n```\n\nAnd the application.js file\n\n```\n//= require jquery\n//= require jquery_ujs\n//= require bootstrap\n```\n\nIt'll work if I omit bootstrap, and I'm not including the tree either, so I'm pretty sure it's something to do with the js in the gem.  Unless I'm not including a gem that I need.\n My application.js file is only 11 lines long, so I'm assuming line 9903 is one of the included bootstrap js files.\n Ah-ha:\n\n```\nRAILS_ENV=development rake assets:precompile\n```\n\nWorks.  So it's some kind of environment thing, and not related to the gem!  Thanks for the help... \n  Adds a helper to display flash messages using bootstrap alerts.\n What you think about that?\n :+1: nice!\n\nI think if bootstrap-sass has a Bootstrap::Rails::Engine, it also can have a Rails Helper\n I have created [bootstrap-rails-extras](https://github.com/doabit/bootstrap-sass-extras), welcome to add other helpers.\n  I updated bootstrap-sass `2.1.1.0  --->  2.2.1.1` and noticed some weird things with the tooltips.\n- The text was layed out differently, e.g. multi-line with no real needs.\n- some tooltips displayed bold text rather than normal, that overflowed the tooltip box (solved with CSS: `.tooltip-inner { font-weight: normal; }`).\n- some tooltips did not display at all.\n\nWhen I rolled back to `2.1.1.0` everything came back to normal.\n\nCan this be SASS related? Or should I report it to the Bootstrap repo?\nThanks\n Thanks.\nI believe there is something wrong with the JQuery function that \"activates\" tooltips, as it is quite weird that in the same page some work and others don't... all with the same code. I'll propably ping the bootstrap guys.\n\n(edited a typo in the first line of the first post: I wrote \"plugins\" instead of \"tooltips\")\n do you mean this issue: twitter/bootstrap#5687\n no, I wasn't using it with tables or {overflow:hidden;} elements.\n  !default is not always defined in _variables.scss. It seems to be absent in new variables.\n  What does this actually let us do? I would have thought compass/Rails handled this automatically. Unless we're going to add vanilla Sass support (which we probably should do) I'm not sure how this changes standard imports?\n Can we reach a resolution on this perhaps?\n  After commit 274d525, none of the includes in bootstrap.scss are found when using SASS or Compass.\n\nDoesn't work:\n     `@import \"boostrap/variables\";`\n\nOld line still works:\n     `@import \"./variables\";`\n `@import \"boostrap/variables\";` should be `@import \"bootstrap/variables\";`, although I guess that's just a typo.\n\nAnyway, I can't reproduce - both in Rails, in Compass, and through `rake debug`.\n That was just a typo. boostrap-sass being included in a non-Rails project with `@import \"../../bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss\";` \n\n`@import \"bootstrap/variables\";` works ok, but then the partial imports in that file fail. \n From what @trisweb has said, I don't think using `@import \"bootstrap/variables\"` is going to work for me. I reverted back a version for now. @trisweb, where would I put that snippet?\n @trisweb It's a Symfony2 project. Using Twitter Bootstrap through https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle and Assetic (https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic). \n It's used alongside, https://github.com/phiamo/MopaBootstrapBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/1-installation.md\n No, it's working the same.\n\n```\nOutput:\n    error assetic_compass1OSJ70.scss (Line 12 of bootstrap.scss: File to import not found or unreadable: bootstrap/variables.\nLoad paths:\n  /private/var/tmp\n  /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/compass-0.13.alpha.0/frameworks/blueprint/stylesheets\n  /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/compass-0.13.alpha.0/frameworks/compass/stylesheets\n  /Users/developer/Sites/project/vendor/mopa/bootstrap-bundle/Mopa/Bundle/BootstrapBundle/Resources/public/sass\n  Compass::SpriteImporter)\n   create assetic_compass1OSJ70.css\n```\n Sass 3.2.3 (Media Mark)\n Thanks for sticking it out with me. I'll open an issue on MopaBootstrapBundle with this information.\n  @import \"bootstrap\" works fine in stylesheets placed directly inside app/assets/stylesheets directory. However, it breaks for files placed in a subdirectory under app/assets/stylesheets with the following error.\n\n```\nActionView::Template::Error (File to import not found or unreadable: variables.\n```\n\nThis was working correctly in the previous gem release. It seems that a couple of files were moved around.\n\nTo fix the incorrect behavior, I changed bootstrap.scss and responsive.scss to use relative paths in @import statements.\n Similar error when I do this : https://gist.github.com/4105556. With latest version of bootstrap-sass (2.2.1.0). So +1 !\n With your patch @umairsiddique  I have error too : Sass::SyntaxError: File to import not found or unreadable: ./variables.\n @kaluznyo try again ... I've pushed another commit.\n Now it's works ! Thanks :+1: \n  SystemStackError: stack level too deep (in /../main.css.sass)\n/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/sprockets-2.4.5/lib/sprockets/context.rb:200 \n\nI tracked the error down and it seems to originate from image_url, more precisely this commit:\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/2fc8201565b7e95d0ca1705c71597b192035603d\n\nI run a set up similar to https://gist.github.com/2143990, and I noticed that when you remove the image_url method in the sprockets-sass gem, it works. So perhaps there's a conflict with the new code?\n\nThe image_url method in the sprockets-sass gem is defined here:\nhttps://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-sass/blob/master/lib/sprockets/sass/functions.rb#L75\n I see. Thank you for the explanation and possible fix. \n\nI did not find any difference when loading bootstrap-sass before sprockets-sass, and it would seem that https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-sass/blob/master/lib/sprockets/sass/functions.rb#L147 is run, but the methods still get called.\n I'd prefer not to fork gems to get around this, but will do so if necessary.\n\nI ran into this today as well. What would you recommend as the cleanest temporary workaround for this until a fix is in place & released?\n\n[This](https://gist.github.com/4128384) is my Gemfile as it stands today, in case that helps...\n\nThanks for any tips...\n No worries. I can't seem to reproduce it on a fresh app right now, so it may be unrelated to this. When I was looking into it earlier today it kept pointing to something in the `sprockets` gem.\n\nI will step through to see if I can get it to do so and will fill you in if I do...or if I figure out where I went wrong. I'm pretty confident it's on my end...it's just odd because it never showed up until I swapped out `twitter-bootstrap-rails` with `bootstrap-sass`.\n\nAnyway, let me dig in a bit more.\n\nThanks for the response. I'll keep you posted.\n **TL;DR:** The issue I was seeing ended up being related to the Vlad gem. I figured it out by trying to rebuild the app, piece by piece into a fresh application. Updating the Rakefile to include vlad replicated the issue.\n\n**Details:**\nIt seems that `vlad` is doing something funny. If I remove it from my Rakefile (or throw a conditional around it), there are no issues whatsoever. I haven't confirmed, but it sounds like [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3105384/why-im-getting-stack-level-too-deep-while-triggering-a-job-using-resque-status) may explain it (I'll dig in more on that tomorrow).\n\nI have used vlad on numerous apps and never seen this, so I don't know if it was introduced with the recent updates to Rake (migrated from 0.9.x -> 10.0.2), Rails (migrated from 3.2.8 -> 3.2.9) when the gem-swapout I mentioned above took place), or what. I think there is some validity to the description in StackOverflow link above though, as when I was digging into it earlier today, it was puking on [caching.rb#L62](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/blob/v2.2.1/lib/sprockets/caching.rb#L62) of the Sprockets gem...which seemed odd. It took me a while to get down there in the debugging process, and I stepped away to see if what was going on would just \"come to me.\" When you mentioned the \"no compass\" stuff, I started looking in another area...and found it. So, thanks for that.\n\nRegardless, sorry for the confusion I added to the thread. Let me know if you want me to delete my comments to keep it focused on the issue at hand. I'll move the topic to the vlad project if/when I can isolate & confirm things further.\n I think [here](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/lib/bootstrap-sass.rb#L6) we should perhaps test for presence of Sprockets as opposed to the asset pipeline.\n Interesting -- github will close an issue if the fix hits _any_ master, not necessarily the one where the issue was opened. Keeping open until released.\n This breaks for me.\n\n```\nundefined method `image_path' for nil:NilClass\n  (in /Users/kain/Sites/myapp/rails/app/assets/stylesheets/admin.css.scss)\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.1.1/lib/bootstrap-sass/compass_functions.rb:5:in `image_path'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/script/funcall.rb:112:in `_perform'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/script/node.rb:40:in `perform'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:327:in `visit_variable'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:100:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `block in visit_import'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `map'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `visit_import'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:100:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `block in visit_import'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `map'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:227:in `visit_import'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:100:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in `block in visit_children'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in `map'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in `visit_children'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:109:in `block in visit_children'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:121:in `with_environment'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:108:in `visit_children'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `block in visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:128:in `visit_root'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:100:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:7:in `visit'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/tree/root_node.rb:20:in `render'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/engine.rb:315:in `_render'\n/Users/kain/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.0.0-p0/gems/sass-3.2.8/lib/sass/engine.rb:262:in `render'\n```\n\n``` ruby\ngem 'rails', '3.2.12' # <= note 3.2.12 still\n\ngroup :assets do\n  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2'\n  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.2'\n  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.2.2'\n\n  gem 'compass-rails'\n  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.3'\n  gem 'tablerender-rails', github: 'masterkain/tablerender-rails'\n  gem 'haml_coffee_assets'\n\n  gem 'asset_sync', '>= 0.5'\n  gem 'turbo-sprockets-rails3'\nend\n```\n I have the same problem as @masterkain \nThe Sprockets image_path fails, Compass too, only third option worked for me:\n\n```\n# Revert to the old compass-agnostic path determination\nasset_sans_quotes = source.value.gsub('\"', '')\nSass::Script::String.new(\"/images/#{asset_sans_quotes}\", :string)\n```\n i'm (randomly) getting the `undefined method 'image_path' for nil:NilClass` issue with a capistrano deploy.\nreally not sure how to reproduce, seems to be started some days ago.\nany idea on how to fix this?\n\nmy gem versions:\n`bootstrap-sass (3.1.1.1)`\n`sass-rails (4.0.3)`\n`sass (3.2.19)`\n`sprockets (2.11.0)`\n`sprockets-rails (2.1.4)`\n update: the problem _seems_ to be a `image-path()` accidentally used inside a `.css` file, not `.scss`.\nmakes any sense?\n Does renaming the file to .scss help?

Would love to have this added.\n Just curious, what's the reason to skip the `<%= yield %>`?\n  It would be very useful (at least to me) to be able to prefix all of the classes provided by Bootstrap, to more clearly distinguish them from my sites' own classes and those provided by other tools. Class names like `row` are far too generic; something like `tb-row` would be much clearer.\n\nUnfortunately, [this idea has been rejected upstream](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/1287#issuecomment-3690546), so I'm submitting it here instead. I'd be happy to submit a pull request with this change if you're interested. I'm mostly scratching my own itch, but I'm also hoping that it will help to advocate for the issue to be reconsidered upstream.\n\nImplementation-wise, this:\n\n``` scss\n.pagination { }\n.pagination ul { }\n.pagination ul > li { }\n```\n\nWould simply become:\n\n``` scss\n.#{$tbPrefix}pagination { }\n.#{$tbPrefix}pagination ul { }\n.#{$tbPrefix}pagination ul > li { }\n```\n\nConfiguration-wise, I'd add an (empty by default) `$tbPrefix` variable to the top of `_bootstrap.scss`, which can be set in my app's stylesheet before importing Bootstrap.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n  Dropdown compatibility for mobile devices, as per\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/4550#issuecomment-8684262\n Fair enough.  Mobile dropdown functionality is pretty important to my site, so I thought others might be interested in the same.\n  It seems Sass doesn't support `fadein` method...\nIt supports [fade_in](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/Sass/Script/Functions.html#opacify-instance_method), so I changed `fadein` to `fade_in`.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you took a look.\nThanks!\nKeiko\n this should be solved the thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass#246\n\n@thomas-mcdonald - <del>If you want discuss, please open a Issue on my fork - I can't manage the settings on jlong Repo</del>\nJohn activated Issues on the main fork\n Sorry about not checking a pull request #246 well.\nThank you for your time checking on this!\nI'm looking forward to #246 going to be merged.\n  Hello,\n\nAre the Media object styles missing?\n\nhttp://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#media\n\nI don't see a _media.scss file in this gem to match _media.less in the official bootstrap distribution.\n\nThanks,\n\nJPG\n Ah, cool, thanks for your hard work on this.\n\nLooking forward to using the new media objects in 2.2!\n  Awesome!\n Do we want to distribute all the tests as well?\n The only other comment I have (that I hadn't noticed before) is that moving all the `.scss` files out of the bootstrap folder and into the stylesheets root is going to break a lot of applications (anything that has a custom distribution) and will probably cause a fair few naming conflicts where people have their own \"buttons\" file etc. I'd rather everything was under bootstrap although I guess that makes automatically updating more difficult?\n @trisweb FYI [RailsAdmin's import](/sferik/rails_admin/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/imports.css.scss.erb) is a pretty good example of what the complex end of custom bootstrap distributions tend to look like.\n\nMy projects (using bootstrap-sass) follow the similar styles of\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\"\n@import \"my_app/variables\"\n\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\"\n@import \"my_app/variables\"\n\nimport all the other bootstrap files\n\n@import \"my_app/custom_css\"\netc\n```\n I like it! I've got a couple of problem sheets that need doing tonight though, so I'll try and get an updated gem pushed at some point tomorrow.\n @thomas-mcdonald Any idea on ETA I'm eager to use some 2.2.1 features? Thanks\n Probably time to roll.\n\n> 1. What needs to be done if we decide to go with the Bootstrap opacity mixin defaults rather than changing them?\n\nArguably nothing. Most of the [bigger public apps](https://gemnasium.com/gems/bootstrap-sass) are locking their gemfiles down nicely. Changing how opacity works won't... break anything horrendously (or I can't really come up with many cases where it will). As a workaround we could recommend people redefine the mixin after importing libraries, as I believe Diaspora does, or to update their codebase with a find all. (see below, I think this was the issue with Compass). Thing is that opacity bugs probably won't be noticed by most people. :(\n\n> 1. What are the consequences for compass, and can we provide an official workaround (automatically in code, or well documented) to avoid issues?\n\nNot entirely sure. I think importing Bootstrap after Compass will cause the compass opacity mixin to be redefined, or vice versa if you import the Compass opacity mixin. Something like that. I think the Compass thing is a lesser issue than changing the mixin range again.\n Any news on this?\n https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass\n\nThanks for all the help with this one, sorry for taking so long to get it out!\n  I'm trying to add the \"img-polaroid\" to an <img> but it doesn't seem to work. \nHere's my code in ruby: \n`<%= image_tag(product.photo, class: \"img-circle\") %>`\nwhich gives in HTML: \n`<img alt=\"Apc_25026243_north_320x\" class=\"img-circle\" src=\".../photo/apc_25026243_north_320x.jpeg\">`\nThe image is displayed, but not the style.\nAny clues?\n Hi @trisweb, the issue was only on my local server. So I updated the `custom.css.scss` with `bootstrap/reset` and it worked.\nHere's the beginning of `custom.css.scss`:\n`@import \"bootstrap\";\n@import \"bootstrap/reset\";`\n\nThough it's weird that the production server would reset the CSS but not the local server.\n  awesome, looking forward to get 2.2 !\n Wake up to see an RSS notification about Bootstrap 2.2, head over to bootstrap-sass and see you're already on it!\n\nThomas, great work you've put into bootstrap-sass, it's proven a big help on many projects for me.\n Thomas, you need any help with anything? Let me know!\n Hey!\nI'm one of the contributors of the [sass-twitter-bootstrap](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap) fork.\nOur goal and focus is to remain a straight 1:1 conversion from Less to Sass. \nWe are already updated to match bootstrap v2.2.1 => [last commits](https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap/commits/)\nWe using Sass 3.2 since our last two builds.\n\nMaybe we can speed up the upgrade of this gem and share some code now and in the future. :rocket:\n\n/m5o\n @m5o :+1: on this idea\n @m5o Good idea, big +1!\n 2.2.1 now even! Looking forward to this, thanks! :thumbsup: \n Please forgive me, but can someone help me understand the difference between the above referenced \"sass-twitter-bootstrap fork\", and this \"thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass\" one ???\n\nIs it that this one is a Gem based asset for Rails, and the referenced one is just a set of static files?  In a Rails app, are there any cons to using the referenced one? It sure seems to be quicly updated right after the real Twitter Bootstrap release an udpate, whereas this one has a slight lag. (Not fussing about this, just asking so I can understand more about this stuff.)\n Good question. @m5o @thomas-mcdonald Could you explain?\n **bootstrap-sass:**\nIs a ready to use gem package mostly used in Rails environments. Compass support and easy setup. I also use this gem in some of my applications.\n\n**sass-twitter-bootstrap:**\nAs I said before, the goal and focus is to remain a straight 1:1 conversion from Less to Sass. No Gem management. Use it in any Sass ready setup (like Rails) or maybe as starting point if you only would use parts of library or modify the Sass files to your heart\u2019s content. Sure you can grab all files and copy it, but maybe we team up the two repos and speed up the release cycle. That's the WIN-WIN Solution.\n\nFor more information read the great article by Pat Shaughnessy on RubySource: \n[Twitter Bootstrap, Less, and Sass: Understanding Your Options for Rails 3.1](http://rubysource.com/twitter-bootstrap-less-and-sass-understanding-your-options-for-rails-3-1/)\n @trisweb :+1: \n\nlooking forward to 2.2.2 :wink:\n :clap: Sweet!\n  \"box-shadow\" mixin should allow multiple shadows as Compass built-in mixin (http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/box_shadow/#mixin-box-shadow) and CSS3 Standars (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/box-shadow).\n\nThis way you will allow Compass to compile without problems. Right now I'm getting the following error:\n\"Syntax error: Mixin box-shadow takes 1 argument but 2 were passed.\"\n I'm not speaking for the author, but this gem is billed as a 1:1 conversion from LESS to SASS, so this may be somewhat of a design decision to exclude Compass as a dependency.\n\nThat being said, I feel your pain. This seems to be the best Bootstrap sass conversion (there are many) but I really like Compass, and I want the best of both worlds.\n\nSo what I do, is copy the bootstrap files from the `vendor/assets/stylesheets` dir into my project. Then in `mixins.scss`, I just comment out `border-radius` and `box-shadow`.

When I get to the `compass install bootstrap` step, I get `No such framework: \"bootstrap\"`.\n\nAnd `compass create compass-test -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap` also fails with `LoadError on line [\"161\"] of /Users/sacha/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/compass-0.12.2/lib/compass/configuration/data.rb: cannot load such file -- bootstrap-sass``.`\n\nAny idea what's going on?\n I have the same problem. Any idea about the solution?\n I had that problem to - I think.  Check your directory structure. It my be off a level.\n I called \"bundle exec compass install bootstrap\" to get it to work. However, this gave rise to some more problems.\n\nThe install wrote several new bootstrap javascript files to my assets/javascripts directory. In Rails 3.2, these are automatically loaded by the asset pipeline, but in the wrong order, so in my browser console, I was getting error messages for a missing constructor and calling 'popover' on an undefined object. After digging around, the solution was just to delete all the newly generated javascript files, as they are already included by having \"//= require bootstrap\" in application.js.\n I'm seeing this now.  Trying to find a workaround.\nEdit: Just had to add `require 'bootstrap-sass'` to config/compass.rb.\n I added the following to my assets group in Gemfile:\n\n`gem \"compass-rails\"`\n\nThen, when I ran the following...\n\n`bundle exec compass install bootstrap`\n\nIt worked.\n\nPreviously, I got the following error (when running `bundle exec compass install bootstrap`):\n\n`~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.2.3/lib/bundler/rubygems_integration.rb:147:in 'block in replace_gem': compass is not part of the bundle.

If you don't see any other problems with it, I'm good, Thomas.  \n I actually have problem `@import` the `bootstrap-responsive` file into my css.  it seems like sass having problem parsing this line:\n\n``` css\n@media (max-width: $navbarCollapseWidth)\n```\n\nin the `_responsive-navbar.scss`.

In _responsive-navbar.scss\n\nhttps://github.com/wndxlori/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_responsive-navbar.scss\n\nYou will find:\n\n@media (max-width: $navbarCollapseWidth) {\n\nIf you have an \"@\" instead of a \"$\", then you might not have pulled the right files.\n Sorry.  That was a typo in the comment.  Even with $, I am still having problem compiling it.\n Ditto:\n\nerror sass/responsive.scss (Line 8 of sass/_responsive-navbar.scss: Invalid CSS after \"...ia (max-width: \": expected expression (e.g. 1px, bold), was \"$navbarCollapse...\")\n Using @wndxlori's fork (including bootstrap-responsive) with Sass 3.2.1 works great for me!\n btw, Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.2 is coming out soon.\n\nIt will allow Turbolinks to work, which will be part or Rails 4.0\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/5308\n\nIm already using twitter-bootstrap-rails with turbolinks (https://github.com/davydotcom/twitter-bootstrap-rails)\n\nBut i'm looking forward to use this gem, I find bootstrap-sass much more stable and I Iike the pure sass implementation.\n\nCheers.\n Actually the fix for Turbolinks is not merged yet in the 2.1.2 wip branch, but I hope it will be integrated.\n  see corresponding bootstrap mixin:\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/mixins.less#L656\n  The warning style was missing for table row highlighting so I have added it.\n  The version 2.1.1 was released, faster than I expected.

Anyway, I've submitted a pull request for my attempt at this update.\n Any update on this?\n I just noticed that this gem is using an old version of Bootstrap.  When will it be updated to 2.1.1?\n Looks like the master code branch is already using 2.1.1, but a new gem containing this change hasn't been released. Will this happen soon?\n :thumbsup: \n :+1: \n And now 2.2.0 is out to update to!\n :+1: \n  I'd like to use Font Awesome fonts, but I'm not sure there's any easy way to disable the default Glyphicons.\n I use the Font Awesome icons and this latest release was causing the wine glass to show up whenever I had a `nav li` element set with the active class.  Since SASS variables can be set with overridden values before calling `@import 'bootstrap';` I was able to set the glyphicons sprite path to an empty string and all is well.  Not sure if this is the best thing to do, but it seems to work fine.\nFor example:\n    `$iconSpritePath: '';`\n    `$iconWhiteSpritePath: '';`\n    `@import 'bootstrap';`\n I use this gem and have good results: https://github.com/littlebtc/font-awesome-sass-rails\n Yes I am agreed with jonathannelson, even twitter-bootstrap-rails (https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails)\nalso have the option to use font awesome.\n I'm using font-awesome-sass-rails.  @tuscanidream, are you not seeing the white wine glass on your active nav-list items?  Maybe it is an incompatibility between the versions I am running.  I've never has to mess with the sprite path before, only since the bootstrap-sass gem update to 2.1.0.0.\n @kiere I tried a test for you and everything works well for me. Let me know if there is something I am missing, or that I mis-understood.\n\nI am currently using `font-awesome-sass-rails (2.0.0.0)` and `bootstrap-sass (2.1.0.0)`.\n\nExample I used based on http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#navs\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"well\" style=\"max-width: 340px; padding: 8px 0px;\">\n    <ul class=\"nav nav-list\">\n      <li class=\"nav-header\">List header</li>\n      <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n      <li class=\"divider\"></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#\"><i class=\"icon-book\"></i> Library</a></li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nMy `application.css` looks like this, with `@import 'font-awesome';` included in my base sass file.\n\n``` css\n/*\n *= require_self\n *= require _bootstrap\n *= require _bootstrap-responsive\n *= require _base\n *= require_tree .\n */\n```\n\nI also tested removing `@import 'font-awesome';` from my base sass file and inserting it at the end of the manifest file, outside of the commented section. require_self would read the font-awesome import before bootstrap. This way works as well, proving that it really doesn't matter where it is included, as long as it's included.\n\n``` css\n/*\n *= require_self\n *= require _bootstrap\n *= require _bootstrap-responsive\n *= require_tree .\n */\n@import 'font-awesome';\n```\n You should be using `@import 'bootstrap'` and `@import 'boostrap-responsive'` in a .scss file, see the Rails [Asset Pipeline Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#manifest-files-and-directives).\n\nBy using the Sprockets `require` in your manifest instead of the Sass `@import` in a .scss file, your other .scss files don't have access to any of Bootstrap's variables or mixins.\n @stevenh512 problem solved. Add them when I need them.\n\n``` css\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap/mixins\";\n```\n @tuscanidream Thanks for taking the time to look at the issue.  Unfortunately, your active class was on the wrong `li`.  It needs to be on the one with the `<i>` tag (with the book icon).  I took your example, dropped it onto my app and switched the 'active' class and the issue is there.  I am using the same versions of bootstrap-sass and font-awesome-sass-rails.\n @kiere I see the issue now.\n\nFor anyone else following, I changed the example to reflect the issue:\n\n``` html\n<ul class=\"nav nav-list\">\n    <li class=\"nav-header\">List header</li>\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\n    <li class=\"divider\"></li>\n    <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\"><i class=\"icon-book\"></i> Library</a></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThis is the line of code that is conflicting, causing the list element to have a background image:\n\n```\n// bootstrap-sass / vendor / assets / stylesheets / bootstrap / _sprites.scss\n// line 31 - 40\n\n/* White icons with optional class, or on hover/active states of certain elements */\n.icon-white,\n.nav > .active > a > [class^=\"icon-\"],\n.nav > .active > a > [class*=\" icon-\"],\n.dropdown-menu > li > a:hover > [class^=\"icon-\"],\n.dropdown-menu > li > a:hover > [class*=\" icon-\"],\n.dropdown-menu > .active > a > [class^=\"icon-\"],\n.dropdown-menu > .active > a > [class*=\" icon-\"] {\n  background-image: $iconWhiteSpritePath;\n}\n\n```\n\nTo remedy this temporarily as a hack, I you could just over-ride this. But I now see the issue and agree that there should be a nicer solution to allow them to play nicely together. I'll sleep on it and see if I can come up with something.\n Any update on that @keilmillerjr ?\n\nI'm experiencing the exact same problem in the exact same kind of setup.\n @dmatheron I haven't played with bootstrap all week. Switched my project to Foundation. However, I did learn how to use github properly and I now know how to make push requests. Already made 2 push requests towards other gems. :) Maybe next week I'll have some time to look into this. For now, I suggest just over-riding the css with a `background-image: none`.\n Has there been any progress on this?  The recommendation by @kiere about setting the `$iconSpritePath`s to blank did work for me - but that seems kinda hacky.\n   Hi thomas, and now with sass 3.2.1 default with rails 3.2.8 any plan to support $navbarCollapseWidth?\nbtw I'm using bootstrap-sass and loving it, plz keep up the good work.\nthanks!\n I'm also on Rails 3.2.8 and Sass 3.2.1. Just upgraded to bootstrap-sass 2.1.1. I see $navbarCollapseWidth in _variables.scss, but setting the variable doesn't seem to have any effect. I am anxious to get away from the kludgy workarounds described here:\n\n[How to change navbar collapse threshold using Twitter bootstrap-responsive?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9405610)\n\nWill $navbarCollapseWidth work in bootstrap-sass, or do I need to get into a compiled LESS environment as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12446008/550712)? Thanks.\n Awesome, thanks for the quick reply. You probably saved me few hours of messing around trying to convert to LESS!\n I'm using bootstrap-sass-2.2.1.1 and `$navbarCollapseWidth: 769px;` in my application.css.scss seems to go ignored. I checked _responsive-navbar.scss just in case and it's up to date using $navbarCollapseWidth. I tried restarting the server and running bundle install for good luck but no dice.\n\nIdeas?\n On branch: \"3\", defining the following variable before `@import bootstrap` works:\n\n``` sass\n$grid-float-breakpoint:\n```\n I am having the same problem as @archonic. Was this ever resolved? It sounds like it should have been but I can't get it to work. I am using bootstrap-sass-2.3.2.2.\n I forget what exactly I did to fix this but it's working for me. I'm currently using bootstrap-sass-2.3.1.3 and sass-3.2.9. @mchapman17 what's your sass version?\n @archonic, Sass version is 3.2.11. I am putting \"$navbarCollapseWidth: 1400px;\" on the line before \"@import \"bootstrap\";\" Have restarted the server and it's still collapsing at the default value.\n\nIs there a way I can check if the variable is being set?\n Check your application.css with dev tools and search for \"1400px\". You\nshould see something like this:\n\n`@media (max-width: 1400px) {\n/* line 13,\n/home/user/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-pxxx/gems/bootstrap-sass-2.3.1.3/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_responsive-navbar.scss\n*/\nbody {\n  padding-top: 0;\n}...`\n Nope, it doesn't have 1400px anywhere, and I can see all the rules for collapsing are still being applied to @media (max-width: 979px). \n I am on bootstrap 3 branch and defining \n\n```\n$grid-float-breakpoint: 767px # before \n@import bootstrap; \n```\n\nstill does not make the navbar collapse on iPad. I would like the menu bar to collapse on portrait iPad.\n Oh!! had to do 769px. Now it works! Thanks.\n\n```\n$grid-float-breakpoint: 769px # before \n@import bootstrap; \n```\n @juniorb Cheers, that worked for me! \nAny idea on how to stop the navbar from jumping onto it's own row?!\n  Bootstraps's documentation includes the following code example for a stacked progress bar: \n    div class=\"progress\"\n      div class=\"bar bar-success\" style=\"width: 35%;\" /div\n      div class=\"bar bar-warning\" style=\"width: 20%;\"  /div\n      div class=\"bar bar-danger\" style=\"width: 10%;\" /div\n    /div\n\nHowever, when you use that in bootstrap-sass, it just results in a single progress bar for the first one listed.  The other two show up, invisibly, in the source code for the page suggesting that this is something to do with the CSS.\n Same problem here :s\n Hi guys,\n\nI'm having a look at this issue but am struggling to recreate. Can you please supply a fiddle and some details on the browsers you're seeing this in?\n I don't know if this will solve it for Etienne, but -my- problem was apparently due to the cache needing to be flushed.  Simply clearing the cache from the Rails console resulted in it working properly.  This is, I assume, something to do with the assets pipeline but I don't know anything more specific.\n I have this in my gemfile :\n\n```\ngroup :assets do\n  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.1.0.0'\nend \n```\n\nThen I have the same HTML code as in this example http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#progress\nWhen I access the CSS, I don't have either float:left on the .bar neither the color management (green for success)\n\nI have restarted my rails server many times, flushed Chrome cache and run bundle install many times but I still don't see the proper styles :s\n\nThanks for your help\nEtienne\n Have somebody solved this problem? I have the same one.\n I have the exact same problem as Etienne above (no stacking or color management), but I'm not using Rails. Not really sure why this is closed considering the issue still seems to be occurring.\n Thanks for the advice!\n Same problem here! I'll try and play around with my custom css\n For anyone still having this problem, I solved it by simply adding \"float:\nleft;\" to the timeline class.\n\nThis seems to have been a problem with prior bootstrap releases and may be\nfixed in a new release.

I found an extended solution to the problem here https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/issues/186#issuecomment-8421951 . This also fixes the colors.\nThanks again\n it did not solve my problem. i've fixed it only in stack, but not colors. \nI'm using twitter-bootstrap-rails gem. Have somebody solution? Thnx.\n TonyDurant, I got rid of the modified code in my custom css and updated the bootstrap-sass in my gemfile to the following... gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.2.1.0'\nIt works perfectly for me, both stacking and coloring. Let me know if this resolves your issue.\n Dooyum, thanks to you. I added and updated my gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.2.1.0' in my rails app but it don't work properly. \n  I have three bootstrap-sass gems installed for my RVM Ruby 1.9.3 on a project. I updated compass to 0.12.2 and now when I run compass watch... it pukes.. \n\nLoadError on line [\"161\"] of /Users/fizz/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/compass-0.12.2/lib/compass/configuration/data.rb: cannot load such file -- bootstrap-sass\n\nEven though bootstrap-sass gem is clearly installed... anyone else have this issue?\n Seems to be a known issue with compass failing to work properly with RVM and gemsets.

Is there another way to make fluid columns in the latest TB?\n Playing with the stable release I realized that makeFluidColumn doesn't really do what I had hoped, so I no longer need it. I was hoping for something which would allow me to use semantic classes rather than putting spanX in my markup while still allowing the site to be responsive. Doesn't look as if makeFluidColumn solves that particular problem.\n Has there been any progress on this? Working on a responsive project now and trying to be semantic in my markup, but use TB's fluid percentage-based grids instead of set pixel values.\n  This closes issue #188\n This pull request [passes](http://travis-ci.org/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/builds/2284929) (merged dc4efae8 into c75e4384).\n Thanks!\n  add \"white-space: nowrap\" to .input-prepend / .input-append like in the less version\n This pull request [passes](http://travis-ci.org/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/builds/2284807) (merged e88d7844 into c75e4384).\n Those are changes from [2.1](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/forms.less#L412)\n okay, forget about it ;-) I didn't realize that your master branch is still 2.0.x\n  `bootstrap-popover.js`\n`bootstrap/_poporvers.scss`\n\n`bootstrap/_tooltip.scss`\n`bootstrap-tooltip.js`\n\nI haven't checked the rest. Anyways, Twitter Bootstrap has everything in plural.\n  There are differences between official Bootstrap and booststrap-sass for progress bars :\n\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_progress-bars.scss#L54\n\n``` css\n.progress .bar {\n  width: 0%;\n  height: 18px;\n  color: $white;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-shadow: 0 -1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.25);\n  @include gradient-vertical(#149bdf, #0480be);\n  @include box-shadow(inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.15));\n  @include box-sizing(border-box);\n  @include transition(width .6s ease);\n}\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/progress-bars.less#L55\n\n``` css\n.progress .bar {\n  width: 0%;\n  height: 100%;\n  color: @white;\n  float: left;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-shadow: 0 -1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.25);\n  #gradient > .vertical(#149bdf, #0480be);\n  .box-shadow(inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.15));\n  .box-sizing(border-box);\n  .transition(width .6s ease);\n}\n```\n\nDifferences are :\n- `height` (not very problematic)\n- `float: left` missing => This miss makes stacked progress bars unusable since they are stacked vertically instead of horizontally.\n Ok, I've needed stacked bars just last week so I didn't notice they were introduced in 2.1...\n\nI'll try the new branch.\n\nThanks !\n Even with the 2.1-wip branch progress bar are still not stacking up :s\n Just add this to your custom CSS in the meantime :\n\n``` css\n// Progress bars\n\n.progress .bar { float: left; }\n```\n\nAnd this to handle colors :\n\n``` css\n// Danger (red)\n.progress-danger .bar, .progress .bar-danger {\n  @include gradient-vertical(#ee5f5b, #c43c35);\n}\n.progress-danger.progress-striped .bar, .progress-striped .bar-danger {\n  @include gradient-striped(#ee5f5b);\n}\n\n// Success (green)\n.progress-success .bar, .progress .bar-success {\n  @include gradient-vertical(#62c462, #57a957);\n}\n.progress-success.progress-striped .bar, .progress-striped .bar-success {\n  @include gradient-striped(#62c462);\n}\n\n// Info (teal)\n.progress-info .bar, .progress .bar-info {\n  @include gradient-vertical(#5bc0de, #339bb9);\n}\n.progress-info.progress-striped .bar, .progress-striped .bar-info {\n  @include gradient-striped(#5bc0de);\n}\n\n// Warning (orange)\n.progress-warning .bar, .progress .bar-warning {\n  @include gradient-vertical(lighten($orange, 15%), $orange);\n}\n\n.progress-warning.progress-striped .bar, .progress-striped .bar-warning {\n  @include gradient-striped(lighten($orange, 15%));\n}\n```\n\nYou'll just have to remove it when 2.1 will be released.\n Thanks @porecreat but hasn't v2.1 already been released ??\n  Offsets work fine unless you switch to a fluid row, at which point they don't seem to be set up. The following simple example illustrates my issue:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"row-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"span6\">\n          span6\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"span3 offset3\">\n          span3 offset3\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n I believe fluid offsets came with 2.1.0: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/3764\n This issue has been fixed on the @dszczyt fork. https://github.com/dszczyt/bootstrap-sass/pull/4\n +1\n  I've manually added (Single Corner Border Radius) & (Single Side Border Radius) CSS3 properties mixins.

Thanks Thomas.\n  I know you are probably hard at work converting the latest version (or someone is ;-), but just wanted to give a heads up (and an issue to slam shut when finished).\n\n_tom edit: Can I ask that you stop +1ing this issue thread now, it's not going to get it released any quicker. I have a few hours tonight to look at it, and I will release 2.0.4.1 before with the fixes currently inbranch for those not looking to upgrade. If you want an email notification on release you can subscribe to the issues thread at the bottom of the page. Cheers!_\n +1\n\nThe new version is fantastic!\nI'll try to help as possible! \n Can't wait!\n Yeah, I'll take a look at it later.\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n :+1:\n +1\n +1\n +2\n +1\n +1\n @thomas-mcdonald is there any documentation of the process you've been following to convert to sass? It might help get some assistance in maintaining and working through updating when official releases are announced.\n +1\n +1\n Guys, did you not see Tom's edit on the original issue?  Please stop spamming him with +s, he's on it.\n -17\n\n<sup>there I fixed it</sup>\n @superchink I was thinking the same thing. I've worked through a few areas myself but mixins in particular can get a bit tricky.\n I won't +1 this, but I'd love it if you could put a GitTip (or whatever) on this project so I can pay you. You've saved me a ridiculous amount of time over the past few months with your hard work. The least I can do is (virtually) buy you a beer or six.\n\nthx,\naaron\n\n(edit: apparently gittip doesn't allow me to give you a one-off donation, which I think is dumb.)\n I second @aaronbrethorst request. I would like to make a donation as well. Thanks for the excellent work.\n I third @aaronbrethorst bootstrap-sass is a great time saver!\n +1\n I hav started the work on https://github.com/dszczyt/bootstrap-sass . Still doesn't work, I'm trying to solve the issues...\n\nEDIT : work done, sass compiles, tests pass, waiting for seeing it in action...\n @dszczyt how can i use your fork in my current project? I alraedy have bootstrap-sass gem installed, i attempted to modify my gemfile \n\n``` ruby\ngem \"bootstrap-sass\", :git => 'git://github.com/dszczyt/bootstrap-sass.git'\n```\n\nand then run\n\n```\n~> gem uninstall bootstrap-sass && bundle install\n```\n\nbut its still referencing 2.0.4.0\n I didn't change the version number in the gemspec file. Fixed.\nI ran the command :\n\n```\nfind ~/.rvm -iname bootstrap-sass-2.0\\* -exec r m -r {} \\; \n```\n\n(be careful before running this command, remove the space between the r and the m after checking !)\nRan bundle update again...\nAnd.... surprise ! it works !!!\n If you're not seeing changes, _touch_ the files that have `@include 'bootstrap'` to flush the caches\n\nAlso, `$gridColumnWidth` and `$gridGutterWidth` don't seem to be working in @dszczyt's branch\n should work with my last update\n SASS 3.2 has been released as well. It would like to see bootstrap-sass depending on SASS 3.2 to support variables in Media Queries (see #107)\n @dszczyt: I'm getting `Mixin gridInput is missing argument $gutterWidth`\n I've switched to @dszczyt's fork but is still serving the old Bootstrap. I've tried to touch the files with the include but the same result. Any tip?\n OK, answering myself:\n\n```\ngem uninstall bootstrap-sass\nbundle update bootstrap-sass\n```\n\nNow it works.\n @corny depending on sass 3.2 should not happen at this time, in this gem.  First, sass-rails is still at 3.1, so if you want newer sass, go file an issue against that gem. Also, this gem is already `~> 3.1`, so if you explicitly ask for sass-rails 3.2 (assuming it's released at some stage), you won't get a conflict.  Finally, your request is completely off-topic to this issue and has no place here.\n @pdf ok, I agree with you.\n @rvrm do you have the issue again ?\n @dszczyt I have the same issue. `Mixin gridInput is missing argument $gutterWidth.`\n Are you using the responsive version ? There were mistakes in it. It should work now.\n Guys, i think is a bit unpleasant talking about dszczyt fork here.\nIf you want support for his version (that i'm going to use, and i thanks him for his work) i think is more appropriate to go to his github fork page.\n And if @thomas-mcdonald wants to merge my branch, I'm ok with that :) I just reused most of his work...\nAnd thanks to @keysen who helped me to do it faster.\n @dszczyt why not issue a pull request then? I doubt he is reading this comment thread.  Otherwise if you end up keeping up with the fork I'd suggest renaming the gem.  However I wouldn't see why @thomas-mcdonald wouldn't be willing to merge in your changes.\n Can we get an update on where this is at?\n +1\n I've been at Leeds Festival this weekend, and something came up the other night which meant I couldn't get the time to work on an update.\n\nI see there has been a pull request with the update but it breaks with Sass 3.1. I'm going to go through it now, fix it & push it onto a branch for testing.\n +1 @thomas-mcdonald  you rock.\n :+1: Amazing work! I'm using anjlab/bootstrap-rails right now, but plan to switch back as soon as this is finished!\n I really look forward to the new 2.1 stuff :) Can't wait! Please let us know if there is anything we can help you with @thomas-mcdonald \n @thomas-mcdonald YOU ARE MY HERO! Thank you!\n awesome.\n @thomas-mcdonald thanks!

Thank you Thomas!\n  As seen here: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2131\n\nThe fix is implemented in bootstrap 2.1.0: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/2.1.0-wip/js/bootstrap-collapse.js#L70\n\nIt would be nice to put the fix in before then. This can be fixed by changing line 70 in bootstrap-collapse.js from `this.$element[dimension](this.$element[0][scroll])` to `$.support.transition && this.$element[dimension](this.$element[0][scroll])`\n  when compiling a project with `--relative-assets`, generated assets urls are absolute and do not take into the account different project structure.\n\ne.g. all images are in the `img` directory, they are copied there during project creation, but after compile, final css has `images`.\n\nlooks like path to the assets is hardcoded.\n\nchanging following lines in `assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss` seems to resolve the issue, but if this is a good solution, then definition of `asset-url` should be removed or changed.\n\nchange from:\n\n```\n$iconSpritePath:          asset-url(\"glyphicons-halflings.png\", image) !default;\n$iconWhiteSpritePath:     asset-url(\"glyphicons-halflings-white.png\", image) !default;\n```\n\nto:\n\n```\n$iconSpritePath:          image-url(\"glyphicons-halflings.png\") !default;\n$iconWhiteSpritePath:     image-url(\"glyphicons-halflings-white.png\") !default;\n```\n  when i use <span class=\"badge badge-info\">some_text</span>\n\nthe badge-info 's background still \"white\", also \"badge-xxx\"\n Same problem in my app, every badges style provide a white background. Labels are working ok.\n Hi guys - can you please supply a fiddle and the browser version you're seeing this issue in?\n my chrome version is 21.0, actually it has the same problem in both firefox and safari\n\ni take a screenshot ![weibopic](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/560ce489gw1dwrn0dhsaij.jpg)\n\n[pic](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/560ce489gw1dwrn0dhsaij.jpg)\n  Hi,\n\nIn style.scss we only got this.\n###### \n\n// I gather this file is a starting point for the project.\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n\n// Include responsive Bootstrap styles\n// @import \"bootstrap-responsive\";\n###### \n\nAny other examples, more substance for style.scss?\n\nAnybody would like to donate some of themes, or whatever appropriate to be included in *.scss file.\n\nThanks.\n  I have followed the README and a couple of online tutorials and here is my project structure\n\n``` text\npublic\npublic/images\npublic/javascripts\npublic/sass\npublic/stylesheets\nviews\nconfig.rb\napp.rb\n```\n\nin my config I have \n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'bootstrap-sass'\n# Require any additional compass plugins here.\n\n\nif defined?(Sinatra)\n  # This is the configuration to use when running within sinatra\n  project_path = Sinatra::Application.root\n  environment = :development\nend\n\n\n# Set this to the root of your project when deployed:\nhttp_path = \"/\"\ncss_dir = File.join \"public\", \"stylesheets\"\nsass_dir = File.join \"public\", \"sass\"\nimages_dir = File.join \"public\", \"images\"\njavascripts_dir = File.join \"public\", \"javascripts\"\n\n# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):\n# output_style = :expanded or :nested or :compact or :compressed\n\n# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions.

My static navbar, when displayed in collapsed (responsive) mode, was showing up as 47 pixels high instead of 40. Also the brand text was no longer centered vertically.\n\nI tracked this back to the `.navbar .btn` element in `_navbar.scss`. The vertical margin of the collapse button is calculated based on the `$elementHeight`. Twitter Bootstrap uses uses 28px; bootstrap-sass uses 20px:\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/b261f9781bbf31f499cb55c49451dc0c0ad43062/less/navbar.less#L220\n\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_navbar.scss#L200\n\nI changed the bootstrap-sass `_navbar.scss` version on my machine to use 28px for the `$elementHeight` and the navbar is once again displaying correctly.\n Confirmed fixed. Thanks for the quick patch.\n  -bootstrap-sass 2.0.3\n-deployed on Heroku\n-happens only on mobile safari\n\nThe responsive-bootstrap navbar template appears, clicking to expand it the page seems to refresh itself and the iphone loading indicator is running. The navbar simultanously expand and then collapses back up.\n\nAt first I thought it was something to do with the assets precompile, since that wouldnt reproduce on iOS simulator in development.\n\nBTW - in development the bootstrap.js file is empty, only the specific ones contain code.\n I've seen the open-close flicker recently on Firefox 12 under Ubuntu (after making the browser narrow enough to activate the responsive navbar button). It only occurred locally, not after precompiling assets and deploying to Heroku Cedar. Usually it would flicker once, and further button presses would not do anything until the page was reloaded.\n\nI fixed an issue with the navbar height ([#146](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/issues/146)) and pressed Ctrl-F5 in the browser to clear the cache and reload the page. The expand/collapse is working again, but that may be due to other gyrations I went through testing the navbar (e.g. removing files from /tmp/cache).\n Thanks for the super quick fix.\nThis indeed resolved the mobile safari issue, however incase the app is opened after being saved to the Home Screen and using the meta tags:\n\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no\">\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"><!-- To make the URL and button bars disappear -->\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black-translucent\">\n```\n\nThe same bug appears again (I've deleted the bookmark, and cleaned safari cache)\n  After updating the gem to 2.0.3 we have some problems with the navbar. At certain times it is not possible to click on the menu-items. It looks like it is randomly.\n\nSwitching back to 2.0.2 solved the problem for the moment. \n Same problem here, especially if I'm using navbar together with scrollspy or nav-tabs. Switching back 2.0.2 solves the problem.\n Sorry, I don't have a simple test case, but much better: I've upgraded to 2.0.3.1 and my problem seems to be fixed.\n\nThank you for the great support ;-)\n issue 145\n\nThanks for the super quick fix.\nThis indeed resolved the mobile safari issue, however incase the app is opened after being saved to the Home Screen and using the meta tags:\n\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no\">\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"><!-- To make the URL and button bars disappear -->\n<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black-translucent\">\n```\n\nThe same bug appears again (I've deleted the bookmark, and cleaned safari cache)\n  I updated gem to use `bootstrap-sass (2.0.3)` I found this error\n\n```\n$ rake assets:precompile\n/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/ruby /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/rake assets:precompile:all RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets\nrake aborted!\nFile to import not found or unreadable: bootstrap/labels.\nLoad path: Sass::Rails::Importer(/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bundler/gems/rails_admin-0c7b8a6a66db/app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/imports.css.scss.erb)\n  (in /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bundler/gems/rails_admin-0c7b8a6a66db/app/assets/stylesheets/rails_admin/imports.css.scss.erb)\n\nTasks: TOP => assets:precompile:primary\n(See full trace by running task with --trace)\nrake aborted!\nCommand failed with status (1): [/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/...]\n\nTasks: TOP => assets:precompile\n(See full trace by running task with --trace)\n```\n\nPlease tell me how to fix it.\n Thank you very much.\n  I'm getting an odd behavior with bootstrap-sass.

An include loop is beeing detected:\n\n```\nSass::SyntaxError in Home#index\n\nAn @include loop has been found:\n    gridCore includes gridCoreSpanX\n    gridCoreSpanX includes gridCoreSpanX\n  (in /path/to/project/app/assets/stylesheets/application/application.css.sass)\n```\n\nTrace:\n\n```\n.../bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss:534:in `gridCoreSpanX'\n.../bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_mixins.scss:528:in `gridCore'\n.../bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_grid.scss:2\n.../bootstrap-sass/vendor/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss:20\n.../path/to/project/app/assets/stylesheets/application/application.css.sass:8\n...\n```\n\nThe only one solution I found is to avoid mixin recursions.\n Brilliant - loops have less overhead than recursive method calls anyway. :+1:\n   +1 with that change\n Why do you think so? Working sample with patched version: http://nezabudem.net/obelisks/29/photos/5 (left-top grey button)\n have you tried changing the `$btnBackground` and `$btnBackgroundHighlight` colors? Especially changing the `$btnBackgroundHighlight` to be something other than a 10% darker version of `$btnBackground`. For example, set `$btnBackground` to be `#fff` and `$btnBackgroundHighlight` to be `#09f`. That should give you a white to blue gradient for the normal button state, but if the `.btn:hover` background color is just 10% darkened white, you'll have a nasty gray creeping in below the blue as the `background-position` slides up `15px`.\n The mechanics of it are that there is a `background-image` as a CSS generated gradient from `$btnBackground` _down_ to `$btnBackgroundHighlight` which initially completely covers the full button. But it is set to repeat only along the x-axis so below it and above it the `background-color` would show through. When a `.btn` is in the `:hover` state, the CSS simply animates the `background-position` _up_ 15 pixels (`background-position: -15px`) thereby moving the CSS gradient _up_ 15 pixels and exposing below it whatever color is set as the `background-color`. That is why I think the `background-color` on `:hover` should be the same exact color as `$btnBackgroundHighlight`.\n\nI hope that helps to explain it even more :)\n  Just an issue to help track the progress of the 2.0.3 branch. It's easy to know when it's \"closed\" then too.\n\nNOTE: There's also a link at the bottom to enable notifications for this issue, without actually commenting.\n Replying so I get notified when the issue is closed, hopefully once it's been updated. :)\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n +1\n There's also a link at the bottom to enable notifications for this issue, without actually commenting.\n +1\n +1\n i need new icons! =)\n +1\n @nir0 It's bug fixes for me. 2.0.2 has modal window placement issues.\n Woohoo!!! Thank you!\n Yay, you rock! :D\n\n[But... Oh crap.](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues?milestone=11&state=closed)\n  Will dependencies of modules be automatically resolved in a future version similar to how `jquery-ui-rails` does it?\n  Starting off with a simple test, setting span8 and span4, and importing the responsive stylesheet as well \n\n``` html\n<div class='fluid-row'>\n  <section id='body' class='span8'>\n    ...\n  </section>                                     \n  <section id='side_bar' class='span4'>\n    ...\n  </section>\n</div>\n```\n\non a desktop-sized view should line up the columns on 1 row horizontally, but they stack vertically one on top of each other.  I think it's because the first column has a margin-left property but it's not supposed to. If I try to manual compensate for the problem by setting `#body { margin-left: 0px; }` then it's fine when It's at a desktop view, but now the second column doesn't automatically fix itself when you test at the smaller widths.  \n\nDid I set something wrong in the markup, or is this an issue?\n same issue here. \n  I spend a little too much time googling for this, so I figured others could benefit from having this lil' nugget in the readme.\n\nEssentially, passing multiple values (`box-shadow`s, for instance) as a single parameter to Sass mixins, requires you to escape the values to avoid syntax errors caused by the comma(s). Other frameworks, eg. Compass, takes [a different approach](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/box_shadow/#mixin-box-shadow), using a fixed number of parameters.\n\nMark Otto (@markdotto) wrote about his approach using escaped values in LESS and I think it warrants documentation in this project. (The site was down when I wrote this, here's a cached copy for reference: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.markdotto.com/2012/04/05/comma-separated-values-in-less-mixins/)\n\nAgain, thanks a bunch for your work on this gem!! :heart:\n I don't understand why this project overwrites the built-in compass helpers. Should the duplicate ones just be escaped?\n @aaronchi People use bootstrap-sass without using compass. I'm not sure of the best way to only add the new mixins to Rails users, so for now they're included everywhere, since one of the appeals of Bootstrap are the mixins.\n And if you really don't want the bootstrap mixins, preferring Compass or Bourbon, etc., you could still just include the Bootstrap files one-by-one, excluding the mixins.\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap/buttons\";\n\netc..\n```\n\nAs with anything in the Rails world, you can get up and running fast with default configurations, and then customize as need be.\n  I'm not sure if this is the right project to open an issue in.\n\n```\n$ compass frameworks -r \"bootstrap-sass\"\nAvailable Frameworks & Patterns:\n  [...]\n  * bootstrap\n    - bootstrap/project    - Bootstrap for Sass\n$ compass frameworks -r \"rails\" -r \"compass-rails\" -r \"bootstrap-sass\"\nAvailable Frameworks & Patterns:\n  [...]\n```\n\nI first noticed this since in my Rails project I had:\n\n```\n$ bundle exec compass init rails --using bootstrap\nNo such framework: \"bootstrap\"\n```\n\nBut outside rails I could initialize with bootstrap. I have the proper gems in my Gemfile:\n\n```\ngem 'compass'\ngroup :assets do\n  gem 'compass-rails'\n  gem 'bootstrap-sass'\nend\n```\n\nAnd I require 'bootstrap-sass' in config/compass.rb\n\n```\nproject_type = :rails\nrequire 'bootstrap-sass'\n```\n It's because of how supported frameworks are currently loaded. We first look for Rails, and if that is found we don't continue to look for Compass.\n\nI've just pushed to branch 2.0.3 with support for loading Rails w/Compass, if you could give it a try.\n Actually, my quickfix isn't so great, since it will override asset-path. I'll have to rewrite the conditional loading.\n For me, there is still the problem, even when using the git version from branch '2.0.3'.\n Yeah, I reverted the changes. I'll sort a fix out after I've finished updating the Bootstrap styles.\n Oh, yes. I just saw you reverted it. If you ping here after you fix it,\nI'll be happy to test.\n\nOn Tue, Apr 24, 2012 at 7:12 PM, Thomas McDonald <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> Yeah, I reverted the changes.

I am currently in a long trip out of the country, so I can't\nreally test what you asked. I hope to be of more help once back home.\nThanks for the amazing job you're doing! :)\n I am also having the same issue please tell me how to resolve this.reply me at ujwala.canopyone@gmail.com\nThanks\n  in my rails apps, I have `<i class=\"icon-user\"></i>`.  It used to display the icon-user icon when bootstrap-sass was 2.0.1.  After upgrading to 2.0.2, the icon did not show up.  It was just blank.\n I have noticed the same\n\nmy bootstrap scss file\n\n```\n// Set the correct sprite paths\n$iconSpritePath: image-path('glyphicons-halflings.png');\n$iconWhiteSpritePath: image-path('glyphicons-halflings-white.png');\n\n@import \"bootstrap\";\nbody { padding-top: 60px; }\n@import \"bootstrap-responsive\";\n```\n\nhttp://localhost:3000/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png\nand\nhttp://localhost:3000/assets/glyphicons-halflings-white.png\nboth render the pngs in the browser?\n\ninspecting the html using firebug gives\n\n```\n.icon-user {\n    background-position: -168px 0;\n}\n\n[class^=\"icon-\"], [class*=\" icon-\"] {  \n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    display: inline-block;\n    height: 14px;\n    line-height: 14px;\n    vertical-align: text-top;\n    width: 14px;\n}\n```\n\nif I hack it with firebug and add\n\n```\nbackground-image: url(\"/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png\");\n```\n\nthen the icon does show up\n just looked at the diff from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/commit/1fa3c2519ddc82a3b3520047f18d65c8d7b0ca82#vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_sprites.scss\n\n```\n-  background-image: asset-url(\"glyphicons-halflings.png\", image);\n+  background-image: $iconSpritePath;\n```\n\nchanged my bootstrap to use asset-url instead of image-path and it works!\n\n```\n$iconSpritePath: asset-url('glyphicons-halflings.png', image);\n$iconWhiteSpritePath: asset-url('glyphicons-halflings-white.png', image);\n```\n\nwondering if this breaking change should exist when bumping a minor version?\n It isn't (or it shouldn't be) a breaking change. $iconSpritePath is a variable, which is set, by default, to exactly the same thing you're doing above. It just means that Compass users can change the image location as they wish.\n\n```\n$iconSpritePath:          asset-url(\"glyphicons-halflings.png\", image) !default;\n```\n\nI just created a new application and the icons seem to be loading fine, so I can't reproduce this.\n\n```\n[class^=\"icon-\"], [class*=\" icon-\"] {\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 14px;\n  height: 14px;\n  line-height: 14px;\n  vertical-align: text-top;\n  background-image: url(/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png);\n  background-position: 14px 14px;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\n yeah - I never should been overriding the sprite in the first place\nwas using 2.0.1 and overriding the sprite path using `image-path`, but I didn't really need to - it worked fine\nafter updating to 2.0.2 the icons were not displayed\nremoving the sprite path override (or changing it to `asset-url`) fixed the issue\n Yes, you're absolutely right.  I had modified $iconSpritePath, which I should not have.  If I removed that line, it all worked.  Thanks.\n I have the same issue on a fresh install of bootstrap-sass. No matter what I put into my bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss file, the icons don't show up. Furthermore, I have errors in the logs saying the following:\n\n```\nStarted GET \"/railsAdminApi/assets/glyphicons-halflings-white.png\" for 127.0.0.1 at 2012-04-26 21:29:44 +0200\nActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [GET] \"/railsAdminApi/assets/glyphicons-halflings-white.png\"):\n```\n\nThe icons are there in the public/assets folder but the route seems wrong. I have tried to put this into my bootrsap.css.scss file:\n\n```\n$iconSpritePath: asset-url(\"glyphicons-halflings.png\", image) !default;\n```\n\nAnd any other combinations, none of which work. \n\nAny ideas are very welcome!\n something doesn't look quite right - those `Started GET \"/railsAdminApi/assets/glyphicons-halflings-white.png\"` calls should not be including the railsAdminApi part, should be `Started GET \"/assets/glyphicons-halflings-white.png\"`\n\nwhat does the rendered (in the browser) bootstrap css look like\n\ntry leaving iconSpritePath overrides out\n I know, that was the same conclusion I came to, the base project name should not be there yet I can't get rid of it. If I leave the variables out I get the same thing. Funny thing is that the CSS is fine, it gets called properly.\n\nI should also point out that I had installed bootstrap-sass-rails before, but I removed it from the gem file, cleaned public/assets, did bundle install and recompiled. Still nothing.\n\nIs there another way to change the path or check where it's being set?\n I'm also having this issue.\n\nIt seems that it's really a sass problem: Changing the background-image on _sprites.scss 2.0.2 to the same as 2.0.1 makes it work.\n @luismreis What do you mean?\n\nNo matter what I try, it always appends the project name before the path. Even if I create the path as absolute or relative or whatever. Where could that path be coming from?\n @kakubel, I'm seeing the same behavior as the original bug report.\n\nI think your issue, even if related to 2.0.1/2.0.2 should be reported separately because it seems like a different problem.\n To add more information:\n\n1) This may be a sass or sprockets problem. I can't tell.\n\n2) In the problem that I'm having, the code change reported in comment 3 above produces in the final css:\n\n```\n...\nbackground-image: \"/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png\";\n...\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```\n...\nbackground-image: url(\"/assets/glyphicons-halflings.png\");\n...\n```\n\nThe missing \"url()\" part breaks rendering at least in Chrome.\n I had to fix these two lines in my bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss\n\n$iconSpritePath: asset-url('glyphicons-halflings.png', image);\n$iconWhiteSpritePath: asset-url('glyphicons-halflings-white.png', image);\n\nthis solved my problem\n Icx, in my case, whatever I change these lines to it gets appended **after** my project name so nothing works. I can't figure out where the project name is coming from and why it's being prepended. \n According to http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html, image-path produces a double-quoted string, while image-url produces the path wrapped in url(). I don't know css well enough to know the difference, but the double-quoted icon path did not work for me in Firefox, while the url() one does work.\n @kliuless, I think you nailed it. Can someone reopen the issue ?\n\n@kakubei, I still think that's a different issue, can you try @kliuless fix above ? That would help triaging it.\n I can confirm that my images were not showing up either, and then I made the change suggested by @kliuless, and it began working!! Thanks @kliuless.\n @luismreis I gave up and installed bootstrap with the static CSS and javascript. Not as convenient, but at least it's working, even with fontawesome icons. \n\n@thomas-mcdonald Which part of Ryan's code breaks the sprite path? I'm curious since I tried so many different things I don't remember if I used Ryan's code or just the gem from scratch.\n @thomas-mcdonald I've followed the Rails Apps tutorial step by step, ie, didn't use a generator. Do you have any more hints ?\n i still have to add this patch with the current master branch version, in application.css.scss just before the boostrap import\n\n$iconSpritePath: image-url('glyphicons-halflings.png');\n$iconWhiteSpritePath: image-url('glyphicons-halflings-white.png');\n @koenhandekyn did you create your app through rails apps (e.g., http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-bootstrap-devise-cancan.html) ?\n\nIf so, older examples for the content of bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss file were incorrect (image-path instead of image-url).\n\nI'm currently running bootstrap-sass 2.0.3.1 with no issues. I believe that this problem is fixed since 2.0.2 (unless you have those two lines wrong on bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss).\n I am using bootstrap-sass-2.0.4.0 and having the original issue: No route matches [GET] \"img/glyphicons-halfings.png\")\n should be looking for `images` not `img`, have you tweaked some setting?\n Good question, I don't know what to tweak to change that.\n .class { background-image: url(<%= asset_path 'glyphicons-halflings.png' %>) }  \n i'm still having this issue 2.2.2.0, using workaround in bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss\n\n```\n[class^=\"icon-\"], [class*=\" icon-\"] {\n  background-image: $iconSpritePath;\n}\n```\n From what I can tell, all of these issues reported are from those who have incorrectly modified the sprite path after following an old tutorial (although the modification was never necessary in the first place)\n\nIf you are still having issues, please open a new issue with a minimal test case we can try and reproduce, any relevant generated CSS and any modifications you have made to variables etc.\n Parroting @thomas-mcdonald, I generated a new rails app using [Rails Composer](http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/) a couple months ago, and after sitting on it for a while and only recently started development work and updating all the underlying gems to be up to date noticed that the glyphicons weren't showing up.\n\nI have no idea if the issue was showing before or if updating the gems made the issue apparent, but they weren't working a couple minutes ago. It was trying to load a `background-image: url(url('/assets/...'));` css style.\n\nIf anyone else has this issue, look in `app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css.scss` and remove or comment out the sprite path overrides.\n Yes, if you had overridden them in your main app SCSS after importing bootstrap, then that would certainly cause issues. Thanks.\n i create img folder under public, and put the two images inside. then it works. Hope that helps\n  Bug in bootstrap-sass/vendor/ assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_scaffolding.scss\n\nbackground-color: $white;\n\nCorrect is: background-color: $bodyBackground;\n  My app works great on my local machine, but when I try to deploy with capistrano, I get this error: https://gist.github.com/2233071.\n\nThe error occurs when the `assets:precompile` is called\n I'm seeing this issue as well.  It isn't capistrano specific.  It only happens when using `bootstrap-responsive` \n\nIt hangs on `** Execute assets:precompile:primary` during production asset compilation.\n Looks like it is fixed in the 2.0.2 branch.\n @ajjahn When it was hanging, did you ever get an error? Or did it just hang indefinitely (mine would take 7 minutes to error out)?\n I don't think I waited more than 4 or 5 minutes.  I just switched to `gem 'bootstrap-sass', git: \"git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git\", branch: '2.0.2'` in my gem file for now.\n Thanks for finding that.  I haven't had a chance to test it, but when we do our next iteration, I'll be sure to try this gem again (later this week).  That solution makes sense to me. \n\nThanks again.\n\nFor reference, SO question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9915950/bootstrap-sass-undefined-variable-baselineheight\n  I was getting an undefined method error until I manually included every bootstrap javascript library.\n\nNone of the bootstrap-\\* javascript files are being loaded if I call `//= require bootstrap` in `application.js`\n\nDo I need to call the helper method in a different way.  Ryan Bate's [episode 329](https://github.com/railscasts/episode-329) also has the same issue.\n\nI am using bootstrap-sass-2.0.1\n I have `bootstrap.js.cofee` under `app/assets/javascripts`.  Does that throw a naming collision?\n Great! Thanks.  I don't quite understand the asset pipeline, thanks for the clarifications.  I'd offer to write that part of the readme, but you'd have to go back and correct whatever I wrote.  Let me know if there is something else I can help you with.\n\nThanks again\n  I'm not quite sure where this bug lies yet but I thought I'd submit an issue.\n i have the same white background issue as well for the primary button\n  It would be nice if you could override the image path to Glyphicons. I'm guessing Rails people can do this somehow, but it would be good for me if you could just specify the path like [other variables](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/download.html#variables). \n\n```\n$iconSpritePath: '../images/glyphicons-halflings.png' \n@import \"bootstrap\" \n```\n Cool thanks!\n  I've moved .clearfix from _mixins to _utilities. The main reason is that each time when you have imported mixins, it has rendered .clearfix class.\n  [class*=\"span\"] was overriding margin-left of offsetX\n  Comments are being hung on for literally minutes. Removing these comments alleviates a ton of time in the assets:precompile tasks\n Huge :+1:\n\nbootstrap-sass@thomas-mcdonald:master\n\n```\nreal    3m1.211s\nuser    2m33.868s\nsys 0m26.980s\n```\n\nbootstrap-sass@tonycoco:master\n\n```\nreal    2m8.506s\nuser    1m58.523s\nsys 0m9.266s\n```\n\nI've added a lot of additional files to `config.assets.precompile` in application.rb, which adds roughly one minute.\nIf I only precompile the bootstrap assets, the entire precompilation is down to ~1 minute.\n I'm going to try to put the perftools on this and see what else could be a culprit.\n Sure thing. I'll do it a bit later today.\n Copyright comments from vendored assets should not be removed.\n    Remove duplicate file.\nFix assets precompilation and ie hex color.\n I guess that would fix #67 also.\n  Thank You :)\n Good man! :)\n thanks a lot!\n Sweet! Thanks.\n Thanks so much :heart: :beer:\n Great work :)\n Thank you for your work! Appreciate it a lot.\n Thank you for your work! I use this gem in all my projects.\n very nice, thank you very much!\n Thank you! :)\n Thanks very much!\n :)\n Just curious if you're using a convert script similar to the other compass bootstrap project? https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap/blob/master/build/convert.rb\n\nIf you wanted to start keeping it in source control, then I'm thinking the community would really help keep things up to date when new versions of bootstrap are released. Otherwise, could we maybe port it?\n\nI'm asking because I really like the way this gem is organized, but I do miss that feature. And I know first hand how difficult it can be for one person to track an upstream lib that's always changing.\n\nThanks again!\n Thanks thomas! I'm eagerly awaiting the latest release!\n Oooo! Just checked out the 2.0.2 brach, badges are coming! \nI was just wondering if it was going to have badges! BADGES!\n\nThanks for this, it's a wonderful gem.\n thanks. great work!\n _\"Badges? Badges! We don't need no stickin' badges.\"_\n\nD'ya think we can bribe you into putting the Bootstrap version in the readme.md?\n Thank you!\n  Ref #62\n @thomas-mcdonald I wonder if it would be possible to release this? \n  I added the new option for activating loop in the bootstrap-carousel, it just an update picked up from the bootstrap repo\n  In the README, says:\n# In config.rb\n\nrequire 'bootstrap-sass'\n\nBut in my rails 3.2 app, I don't have that.\n Are you using bootstrap-sass with Compass? I believe it's compass that provides the config.rb file. There are two sections in the readme, one for Rails projects, and another for Compass-based projects (could be rails, sinatra, etc).\n @thomas-mcdonald Kindly update your wiki about this issue. Explicitly mention about Compas \n  There was a very minor typo (sproket instead of sprocket) in the README file. So I decided to fix it. \n Thanks\n Funny, I get a 500 when I try to merge it. \n\nIt finally happened. :octocat:\n  So on the home page you have mentioned that:\n\n> Import \"bootstrap\" in your SCSS file of choice to get all of Bootstrap's styles, mixins and variables! Don't use Sproket's //= require directives for SASS files, because they're horrible and will kill your cat.\n\nWhy are Sprocket's `//= require` directives horrible? Why do you prefer `@import`? That sentence is not any helpful at all. It is just confusing.\n Sprockets compiles each file individually, so mixins or variables to set in one file do not work in another; hence, all the mixins and variables available via Bootstrap are not within the scope of your own files, so you can't use them.\n\nImport basically imports the files together and then they are compiled, allowing you to override and use Bootstrap.\n Sorry if this is misinformed; but then doesn't this mean that you lose the performance improvements of only having to recompile the single SASS file that's been changed, when in a development environment? I suspect that not using sprockets (in order to use mixins) is the reason I have to wait ~2-3 seconds each time I want to recompile my CSS.\n\nEDIT: Aha! Think I found a really nice solution; instead of having to `@import \"bootstrap\";` in every scss file, I'm just doing that in my main.scss and then doing;\n\n``` css\n@import \"bootstrap/variables\";\n@import \"bootstrap/mixins\";\n```\n\nwhenever I need mixins in scope. I've got < 100ms compile times again :)\n @tombh That's a nice solution! But after that why we still using `@import` instead of `=require` in the main manifest file?\n @namiheike It's so long ago now, I'm not sure I remember! I _think_ it's because if you use `=require` then the mixins aren't included.\n  Hey,\n\nto use this:\n\nhttp://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/\n\nyou have to not load _sprites.sass.\n\nthoughts? :/\n @thomas-mcdonald: sorry for the comment on the closed issue - but are you saying, do this rather than just doing @import 'boostrap' -- and push this in say, vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.sass ?\n\n-james\n Yea, it appears that font-awesome will never make it into official bootstrap.\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/pull/2479\n\nThe ideal would be something like this from the end usage point of view.\n\n``` css\n$use-font-awesome: true;\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n@import \"font-awesome\";\n```\n\nBut my [quick search shows](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sass-lang/XO3DzJsp7fY/ppxb7OljL0AJ) that we can not do something like this.\n\n``` css\n@if $use-font-awesome == false { @import \"bootstrap/sprites\"; }\n```\n\nI even played around with this idea for bootstrap-sass's _bootstrap.scss file.\n\n``` css\n// Support Font-Awesome Option\n$use-font-awesome: false !default;\n$sprites-imprort-file: \"bootstrap/sprites\";\n@if $use-font-awesome == true { \n  $sprites-imprort-file: \"bootstrap/noop\";\n}\n\n@import $sprites-imprort-file;\n```\n BTW, I just tried out the [font-awesome-sass-rails](https://github.com/littlebtc/font-awesome-sass-rails) project and did this and it worked like a champ. So maybe this whole ticket is moot now?\n\n``` css\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n@import 'font-awesome';\n```\n @metaskills Thank you. That gem worked like a charm. It's a shame bootstrap doesn't add font-awesome because apparently all they would have to do is add a comment in source code with a link to font-awesome's github. https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/3131#issuecomment-5198865\n Eventually they will come around as the retina-web will drive this forward. I do however like that it is another project because FontAwesome has been adding tons more lately. Cheers!\n Hi metaskill, I installed the gem font-awesome-sass-rails and tried to load from a compass project, and I get the error 'file to import not found or unreadable, because it's missing it's load path?\n\nI am not sure how I could fix that, there was nothing about load path in the config.rb, but I don't know where else to add load path...

Is it possibly related to this bug fix?  Would this need to be incorporated into the latest gem version?  https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2036\n\nMany thanks,\n-Dave\n Thanks, Thomas.  I'm relatively new to Rails, so I'm not sure I completely understand. What fixes would I need to make to remedy this and have the carousel working now?  Or does this need me to download a new version of the bootstrap-sass gem to cover for Twitter's bug?  Thank you!\n Terrific -- thanks so much!\n   Sure thing. Just comment here and I'll update as necessary.\n :)\n  This was a Bootstrap issue which is now checked in.  Hoping it makes it into the gem\n\nSee: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/2023 and https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/3d58b4622671bc51c22c857641db3b988e73632a\n  ### Issue\n\nThe way the original twitter bootstrap distribution is organized, it's expected one can customize various aspects of it.  In this case, the files would normally be copied into a project and could be readily edited if necessary.  However, with the packaging of the SCSS files in a gem, they are not available for modification.  \n#### Modification of Variables\n\nThe settings in `bootstrap/_variables.scss` are expected to be modified.  An easy way to expose the variables would be to use the compass templating to copy the contents of _variables.scss into the generated styles.scss before the `@import \"bootstrap\"` while possibly removing the `!default` notation.  Any change to a variable made by a user would override the same variable in `_variables.scss` when imported.\n#### Modification to Imported Mixin's\n\nFor applications that won't use various bootstrap mixin's it would be ideal if `_bootstrap.scss` was locally editable so such mixin's could be commented out.\n **Work around to copy bootstrap/_variables.scss into styles.scss**\n1. Cd into the sass_dir location specified in your compass config.rb\n2. Copy bootstrap/_variables.scss out of the gem and append to styles.scss (one long line):\n   `$ cat $(dirname $(gem which bootstrap-sass))/../vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss |`\n   `sed 's/ !default//' >> styles.scss`\n3. Edit styles.scss and move `@import \"bootstrap\"` and `@import \"bootstrap-responsive\"` to the end of the file.\n4. Make any other desired edits to the variables.\n **Work around to copy _bootstrap.scss from gem**\n1. Cd into the sass_dir location specified in your compass config.rb\n2. Copy _bootstrap.scss out of the gem into local stylesheet directory:\n   `$ cp -p $(dirname $(gem which bootstrap-sass))/../vendor/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss .`\n3. Edit _bootstrap.scss and comment out any `@import`'s for mixin's that aren't needed.\n OK, Rather than copying all the variables it would be helpful to have links to the relevant information.  Someone maintaining an application may not be familiar with bootstrap-sass or bootstrap for that matter.  Is this more reasonable for styles.scss?\n\n// See https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/README.md\n// for information on this SASS implementation of Twitter Bootstrap.\n\n// Add any bootstrap variables below to override the defaults.\n// Complete list at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#variables\n// Links\n//$linkColor:             #08c;\n//$linkColorHover:        darken($linkColor, 15%);\n// Typography\n//$baseFontSize:          13px;\n//$baseFontFamily:        \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n//$baseLineHeight:        18px;\n//$textColor:             $grayDark;\n// Default 940px grid\n//$gridColumns:             12;\n//$gridColumnWidth:         60px;\n//$gridGutterWidth:         20px;\n\n// I gather this file is a starting point for the project.\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n\n// Include responsive Bootstrap styles\n// @import \"bootstrap-responsive\";// Variables.less\n It would be really helpful to have an installer. A website I'm working is past the \"bootstrap phase\" and needs full customization of bootstrap styles.\n\nNot needing to customize files directly is great for starting off, but there comes a point where you need to edit the files directly.\n Once issue #70 has been addressed, after compass install, you will be able to do a compass unpack bootstrap to extract all the files locally.  I may have a fix for #70 but I want to test some more.\n  The README said to \"import 'bootstrap' in your SCSS file of choice, so I created bootstrap.css.scss and added the @import statement. I kept getting the Action Controller error \"An @import loop has been found: ../app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.css.scss imports itself\". Finally realized that it was importing the local file by name rather than going to the gem directory. Renamed my file to bootstrap_loader.css.scss and all is well. \n\nMay I suggest:\n\nImport \"bootstrap\" in any SCSS file in your /app/assets/stylesheets directory to get all of Bootstrap's styles, mixins and variables! Don't use Sprocket's `//= require` directives for SASS files, because they're horrible and will kill your cat. You can add the @import statement to a new file, e,g. bootstrap_loader.css.scss. Don't import bootstrap in application.css; that's not an SCSS file. And don't use a file named bootstrap.css.scss or it will try to import itself. \n Sorry, just realized that even more explicit instructions are needed. If the file containing the @import statement is loaded based on the default `//= require_tree .` in application.css, then the file must be named so that it precedes all other files alphabetically. If it's named bootstrap_loader.css.scss and I have an apples.css.scss file containing custom CSS, the CSS in apples.css.scss will be clobbered by bootstrap.\n\nThere may be a way around this by using subdirectories and/or the 'stub' directive added to Sprockets 2.2.0. For now, naming the file \"!bootstrap_loadfirst.css.scss\" is a workaround. Other suggestions?\n FWIW, here is what I'm using now.  I created **application** and **scopes** directories under **app/assets/stylesheets** for  my application-level and scope-level override stylesheets, respectively.  Then I have these \"top-level\" files:\n\n**app/assets/stylesheets/application.css**:\n\n```\n/*\n * Load Bootstrap first so we can override it\n *= require bootstrap_loader\n\n * Application-level styles next\n *= require_directory ./application\n\n * Anything in this file is also application-level\n *= require_self\n\n * Finally the scope-level styles\n *= require_directory ./scopes\n\n * Note that we do NOT have the default \"require_tree /.\" because we want to \n * control the sequence of loads, especially getting Bootstrap loaded first.\n*/\n```\n\n**app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_loader.css.scss**:\n\n```\n/* Do NOT name this file \"bootstrap.css.scss\" or you will get an @import loop. */\n\n/* Override Bootstrap variables here */\n// $primaryButtonBackground: #f00;\n\n@import \"bootstrap\";\n@import \"bootstrap-responsive\";\n```\n\nSeems to be working.\n  Hi I revised every scss file, and saw you just did the same :). Maybe you see something you can use.\n No worries, better twice than waiting the weekend ;) Maybe next time.\n  In the variables section i noticed $gridRowWidth does not have a !default at the end. Is that intentional? (I can't overwrite it in my styles)\n  For some reason, when using bootstrap-sass with <a href=\"https://github.com/welaika/wordless\">Wordless</a>, image-url seems to work when asset-url doesn't, but I'm not sure why. Could you switch to using image-url(\"img.png\") instead of asset-url(\"img.png\", image)? Would changing this interfere with anything else?\n No problem. It may well be something on the Wordless side of things. From what I see, Wordless currently doesn't have any way of using compass plugins such as bootstrap-sass, so I created <a href=\"https://github.com/welaika/wordless/pull/53\">a pull request to implement that</a>. It's very basic, and maybe I'm missing something important - I'm really new to Compass/Sass.\n The Compass magic in Wordless happens in the <a href=\"https://github.com/emzo/wordless/blob/master/wordless/preprocessors/compass_preprocessor.php#L79\">process_file() function within the CompassPreprocessor class</a>. It creates a temporary config file which is passed to compass as an argument using the --config directive. My pull request (mentioned in the <a href=\"https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/63#issuecomment-3969481\">comment above</a>) simply adds a <code>require \"plugin-name\"</code> to the top of this config file. A typical config file looks something like this:\n\n``` ruby\nrequire \"bootstrap-sass\"\nhttp_path = \"./\"\nhttp_images_dir = \"../images\"\nimages_dir = \"../assets/images\"\nhttp_fonts_dir = \"../fonts\"\nfonts_dir = \"../assets/fonts\"\ncss_path = \"/var/www/my-wp-website/wp-content/themes/my-theme/tmp\"\nrelative_assets = false\noutput_style = :compressed\nenvironment = :production\nsass_path = \"/var/www/my-wp-website/wp-content/themes/my-theme/theme/assets/stylesheets\"\n```\n\nHere's what a typical <a href=\"https://github.com/welaika/wordless/tree/master/wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme\">Wordless theme directory structure</a> looks like.\n Apologies for not replying sooner. Nope, didn't fix the issue, but request #73 which was merged into your 2.0.2 branch will at least allow me to bypass the problem!\n  Hi,\n\nPrecompiling assets takes ~3mins when I import bootstrap.\n\nI have no idea why. Maybe somebody can shade some light.\n\nThis is my layout:\n\n```\n> tree app/assets/\napp/assets/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 images\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 icons\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 apple-touch-icon.png\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 favicon.ico\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 javascripts\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.js\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 frameworks.js.coffee\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 stylesheets\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.css\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frameworks.css.sass\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 layout.css.sass\n\n> cat app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/frameworks.css.sass \n/*\n *= require_self\n *= require_tree . \n*/\n\n\n@import \"bootstrap\"\n@import \"bootstrap-responsive\"\n\n> cat app/assets/javascripts/application.js app/assets/javascripts/frameworks.js.coffee \n//= require jquery\n//= require jquery_ujs\n//= require_tree .\njQuery(function(){ $(\"body\").addClass('dom-loaded'); });\n\n\n#= require bootstrap\n```\n\n```\n# Gemfile\ngroup :assets do\n  gem 'sass-rails', '~> 3.2.3'\n  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'\n  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.0'\n  gem 'compass', \" >= 0.12.alpha.0\"\n  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'\n  gem 'therubyracer' # To compile CoffeeScript\n  gem 'jquery-rails'\nend\n```\n\nSo there's really not much going on. Pretty standard stuff.\nWhen I remove the `@import bootstrap` from `sass` file then the compilation is pretty \"snappy\" (~15 secs including Rails startup).\n\nAny thought what could be causing this?\n\nCheers.\n 40 seconds (Rails 3.2) is still relatively long. In moderate sized app assets are compiled within ~15secs or so if I don't use bootstrap-sass.\n\nBut for me the new Rails 3.2 boostrap-sass compiles very fast.\nSo there must be something specific to my config (https://gist.github.com/1832369).\n\nHere's full output just in case:\n\n```\n> time RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile\n/Users/dnagir/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/ruby /Users/dnagir/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0/bin/rake assets:precompile:all RAILS_ENV=production RAILS_GROUPS=assets\n\nreal    3m0.787s\nuser    2m46.590s\nsys 0m5.156s\n```\n\nThere might be an issue with something else, not bootstrap-sass.\n Ohh,\n\nI think I have nailed it down. In the config I have `config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib)`.\nRemoving this line from `application.rb` makes assets compile within 11 seconds.\n\n(There are no any assets in lib at all).\n\nI suspect that's a sass/rails issue, not exactly sure.\n Actually, that's not right. The compilation just quits with an error which I looked at as success. So, no it's not the `autoload_paths` thing :(\n\nThe compilation time is 17s when I remove `app/assets/stylesheets/frameworks.css.sass` file.\n\nThe content of it is just:\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap\"\n@import \"bootstrap-responsive\"\n```\n\nSo there's really something to do with bootstrap-sass.\n getting a similar issue, cpu shoots to 100% and just seems to stall when I include a file identical to frameworks.css.sass as described above. If I remove it and include twitter bootstrap normally, everything's fine.\n I also see slow precompile times for my sass files which import bootstrap. But what seems odd is that in development mode where it just recompiles when source files change it seems to be able to regenerate those files in just one or two seconds. Why the difference?\n +1 \nIt takes around 2 minutes to precompile on Heroku\n +2 takes at least 2-3 minutes\n 5 minutes here in production\n 3-4 minutes for me using ruby 1.9.3-p125 & Rails 3.2.1.\n 5 minutes for me :(\n 5 minutes for me on Heroku with responsive, 2 minutes without responsive.\n 2 minutes on rails 3.2.2 and ruby 1.9.3-p125\nalso I tried to run it in development environment and it took about 10 seconds\n +1\n +1\n +1\n @thomas-mcdonald, now worries. Thanks for getting on the issue.\nNot sure I can trace it down too much further, but if you need any additional info please let us know.\n\n_ASIDE_: Do you know what the changes are in the 2.0.2?\n @thomas-mcdonald I've looked into this. I can specifically trace this down to importing the **bootstrap-responsive** styles.\n\n```\n@import \"bootstrap-responsive\";\n```\n\nWithout this one line. My assets compile in **50 seconds** with, it takes **4 minutes 30 seconds**.\n\nIf I do a trace of the Ruby process running `rake assets:precompile` I can see a massive amount of nesting. It looks very much like sprockets is having a hard time processing this file.\n I don't think it's only the responsive.\n50 secs is still way too long. Removing imports decreases time step by step.\n\nFor example, importing and compiling compass only takes ~15 seconds.\n\nSo definitely there must be something to do with the bootstrap-sass.\n\nOn 11/03/2012, at 11:08, David Ricereply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\n> @thomas-mcdonald I've looked into this.

That's about **25 seconds** each. Which I would like to be faster for sure however **any** improvement is going to be less beneficial than the immediate **3 minutes 40 seconds** saving!\n\nLet me see if stripping bootstrap requires down further gives any statistically significant improvement in our app.\n Okay. Stripping out our `@import 'bootstrap'` and replacing it with a more granular set of imports that we actually need. As in [_boostrap.scss](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/vendor/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss) same with requiring separate javascript modules in **application.js**. This reduces our total time by about **5 to 10** seconds.\n\nAlso noticed we could save some time by removing **highcharts.js** from our precompilation of **application.css** and statically referencing the library only on pages required. Saves another **5 seconds** or so.\n I've also put together a patch for rails that will speed up compilation for you by not bothering with the _nondigest_ variants of your assets. Cutting our `rake asset:precompile` time significantly.\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379\n @davidjrice \"save some time by removing highcharts.js from our precompilation of application.css and statically referencing the library only on pages required\"\n\nwhat?\n @masterkain I was purely sharing other tips for cutting down asset precompilation. Obviously, the less stuff you have to compile the better.\n\nThe only issue here is **boostrap-responsive** takes an inordinate amount of time to compile.\n No idea, git blaming the file reveals that `normalize_indentation` was introduced initially to support comments.\nSpecifically it trims tabs before comment block:\n\n```\n\"                           \" # pre\n                           /* IE6-7 */ # str\n```\n\nAlso the `pre` variable is shadowed.\n I've just installed your gem and can say that SCSS precompile takes 8365ms-17128ms.  \nJS compilation is fast.\n summoning @nex3 ; maybe he has some observations..\n I noticed that removing the comments at the top of backbone-responsive solves this. \n(Literally, remove the first few lines of comments, that's it) \n\nI can only guess, but perhaps the asset pipeline is evaluating these comments or something? \n On EC2: command finished in 941875ms\n @heeton In my fork of this, I took precompile time from 8 minutes down to 1 minute by removing those comments. We should look into why this is happening. SASS seems to be goofing the comment blocks up.\n\nhttps://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/pull/92\n works for me on Heroku. it now compiles in under a minute (and it took around 7 minutes before)\n Yeah, this works great again.\n  Thanks so much for this gem BTW!!!!\n  Should I include it under the `:assets` group or for all groups in my `Gemfile`?\n I placed it in the assets group, which works perfectly\n  Fix for issue #52. \n\nUpdated all instances of opacity mixin to use 0..1 instead of 0..100 to not conflict with compass mixin.\n FYI: https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/b19eb88b5abb7fd9dfc3aacc7ac3d296e1e98861 - starting with 3.0 the actual bootstrap will use a correct 0..1 range.\n  Attempting to define a CSS causing the the above error \n###### Attaching the Stack Trace\n\nbootstrap-sass (2.0.0) vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_reset.scss:38:in `tab-focus'\nbootstrap-sass (2.0.0) vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_reset.scss:38\napp/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss:1\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:170:in`visit_mixin'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:18:in`visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in `block in visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in`map'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in `visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:27:in`block in visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:39:in `with_environment'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:26:in`visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `block in visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:238:in`visit_rule'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in `visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:18:in`visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:146:in `block in visit_import'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:146:in`map'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:146:in `visit_import'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in`visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:18:in `visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in`block in visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in `map'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:53:in`visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:27:in `block in visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:39:in`with_environment'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:26:in `visit_children'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in`block in visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:47:in `visit_root'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/base.rb:37:in`visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:18:in `visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/visitors/perform.rb:7:in`visit'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/tree/root_node.rb:20:in `render'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/engine.rb:299:in`_render'\nsass (3.1.14) lib/sass/engine.rb:246:in `render'\nsass-rails (3.2.4) lib/sass/rails/template_handlers.rb:106:in`evaluate'\n\nUsing\n###### bootstrap-sass (2.0.0)\n Had the same problem here, and I had `@import \"bootstrap/reset\"` in some sass file in my assets.

Also, I have restarted my server. \n\nNow I'm getting:\n\n``` shell\n couldn't find file 'bootstrap'\n  (in /projects/testing/app/assets/stylesheets/application_en.css:5)\n```\n\nI do have the needed require statement in my manifest file, which is used to work for me:\n\n``` css\n/*\n *= require bootstrap\n*/\n```\n\nNot sure what's missing here. Any help?\n We ended up fixing it by removing the ~> 2.0.0 part of the Gemfile definition:\n\n```\ngem 'bootstrap-sass', :git => 'https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.git'\n```\n\nand removing the 'require bootstrap' line from our application.css\n\nWe are using @import \"bootstrap\" in our base.scss file which could also be causing the issue.\n  Using v2.0 I noticed the modal overlay blacks out the screen because opacity is set to 80, not 0.8;\n\nCompass defines the [opacity mixin](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/opacity/) to take a value between 0 and 1.\nTwitter bootstrap's LESS [opacity mixin](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/less/mixins.less#L380) takes a value from 0 to 100.\n\nI'm adding a few bootstrap components to an existing compass styled site using Rails 3.2 with asset pipeline. I worked around this conflict by having two separate top level stylesheets, having a bootstrap only one that does not include compass.\n\nI guess this is a good use case for [namespacing](https://github.com/sporkd/compass-h5bp/commit/80ff83f7dd023bb93a50327944ce01395a6de7b8)?\n It is broken again since 776583f08ec49788e677d3c679aa2b926eb59185\n\nSo what would you suggest to do? Downgrade?\n I'm having issues with this, too. Including Compass after Bootstrap seems to do the trick for me.\n  Thanks for the update to 2.0! I have a strange issue: after I updated to 2.0, responsive was working fine for about 20 minutes, then very suddenly I got an ugly sass import error:\n\nFile to import not found or unreadable: bootstrap/responsive.\nLoad path: Sass::Rails::Importer(/Users/ian/work/homestars-www/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss)\n  (in /Users/ian/work/homestars-www/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss)\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? \n\nThe only thing I can think of that might be a problem is I installed the new beta of live reload, but I've since turned it off and I'm still getting the import error.\n\nAny help on this issue would be appreciated muchly\n AH, there it is. Thanks so much. Great work!\n  I'm using the Bootstrap 2.0 branch in my Rails app, but I've found that the javascript components (specifically the dropdown) aren't working.  If I include the js directly from the Twitter lib (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/js/bootstrap-dropdown.js), then dropdowns work fine.\n\nHas anybody else encountered this problem?\n Possibly related: after updating bootstrap-sass from 1.4.3 to 2.0.0, I'm getting:\n\ncouldn't find file 'bootstrap-alerts'\n  (in /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Data/Dropbox/railswork/marqer/app/assets/javascripts/application.js:12)\n\nThe referenced line is\n\n//= require bootstrap-alerts\n Never mind. Twitter changed from bootstrap-alerts to bootstrap-alert. A foolish consistency...\n Try this in `application.js` \n\n```\n//= require jquery\n//= require jquery_ujs\n//= require bootstrap\n```\n\nI was having the same problem until I moved the `//= require bootstrap` statement AFTER the `//= require jquery_ujs` statement.\n @thomas-mcdonald Sorry, I've been playing with both the `bootstrap-sass` and the `bootstrap-sass-rails` gems. But I was having the same problem in both my test applications until I moved the require AFTER the jQuery stuff.\n Thanks for the responses.  Changing the require order fixes this for me.  \n I'm actually randomly running into this issue after everything working perfectly for so long. \n\nThe Dropdown JS suddenly does not work for me. Everything else works fine. I suspect there's some sort of JS clash somewhere, but I'm not sure where. \n\nI think the problem started after moving the gem out of the :asset group because I was having trouble deploying to Heroku. \n  I know 2.0 has been converted in the 2.0 branch (I'm using it and it's good btw) but will it get an official tag and release?\n Wondering the same thing. And great work again :)\n +1\n I propose we move on without vendoring 1.4.\nIf you can push 2.0 now, I'll upgrade RailsAdmin today (10am here).\nI don't know about responsive, but if you can push 2.0.0 without it and 2.0.1 with it, it's all good to me.\n\nCheers.\n +1\n Ok, let's do this :shipit:\n  bootstrap responsive is included separately, its imports still had the old paths.\n One would think, but this is all that works on our compass/rails project. I\ndon't pretend to understand the pathing for sass' @import\n\nDoes @import bootstrap/responsive work for you without this patch?\n Ok, so I undid my change and it's working today. I have no idea what's going on. I'm going to close this for now. Your idea of making it bootstrap-responsive seems solid. Especially since it fits with the javascript style you're doing.\n Nevermind. It was being cached in tmp/sass-cache. I can't `@import bootstrap/responsive` without this change, so I'll reopen this, but as you said, may be better just to use bootstrap-responsive.\n +1\n  according to https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/commit/9b9e1d309bada7983434b092b40b088147a42a2e#less/forms.less\n  I'm not sure if this is a sass compilation error or a bug in the twitter bootstrap.css for version 2.0.

CSS has an @import directive that allows you to break your styles up into multiple stylesheets, but each stylesheet takes a separate (slow) HTTP request. That\u2019s why Sass\u2019s @import directive pulls in the stylesheets directly. Not only that, but any variables or mixins defined in @imported files are available to the files that import them.\n\nSass has a naming convention for files that are meant to be imported (called \u201cpartials\u201d): they begin with an underscore. Let\u2019s create a partial called _rounded.scss to hold our rounded mixin.\n\nIn order to support both .scss and .sass files, Sass allows files to be imported without specifying a file extension. That means we can just import \"rounded\", rather than \"rounded.scss\".\n\nI checked the gem, and it looks like it does not use the underscore convention to import the files. Do you have a trick behind this or do you use the normal css slow import like they mention? If it's the case, maybe converting the imports using the sass  convention would be good?\n\nThanks\n  It crashes with compass (and config.assets.precompile << /(^[^_]|\\/[^_])[^\\/]*$/) when i do\n\n  bundle exec rake assets:precompile\n\nwith message:\n\n  Undefined variable: \"$baseline\".\n +1\n  Without !important, IE8 reset filter isn't overriding.\nIt works on IE9.\n  It seems working without sass-ie_hex_str.rb.\nI am using Rails 3.2.1\n\nReference: #20\n  Expected a color.

For me it was because I had bootstrap.css (from Twitter) in my app/assets/stylesheets, guess it was causing some conflicts. \n  When running in Rails in development mode the dropdowns for the navigation bar weren't working (in production mode they were fine), changing the order in which the javascript files are loaded solves this issue. I've changed it and humbly offer you my pull request :)\n Hm, it looks like I was mistaken... upgrading to 1.4.4 probably solved the issue instead. Please disregard this pull request.\n  I'd love to see this as a Compass plugin that I can just pull-in to any project.\n Does anyone really even use sass gems without either compass or rails? (or both) I'd imagine anyone using a sass library in a \"standalone\" environment is probably using compass but maybe not? \n\nI don't see why starting out with rails and compass support (separately or together if your using both) is a problem. If Rails is loaded, load the engine. Include files etc for compass so it can function as a compass extension when working in a non-rails environment. I'd imagine the gemspec wouldn't require either of them except maybe as development dependencies (if you wanted to contribute writing helpers and such). Should probably add a test framework for development as well. I'd just use rspec unless anyone else objects to that :) Using minitest/testunit is fine too, or i guess technically we could run both.\n It would be fair to make the port of Bootstrap to sass rely on Compass, seing as almost every sass user is using it.\n\n@brentkirby, it's not a problem per se, but Bootstrap as is, is a front-end toolkit and not dependent on any other framework. Having said that, I don't even know what gemspec is. Just not sure I see why Bootstrap should be mixed with with anything else but sass.\n sure. just forked it. Is everything up to date on the 2.0 branch?\n Wouldn't it make it a lot easier for us if we waited with the conversion until their testing and feedback have ended?\n Is there a branch with some work in progress on this? I'd love to finish this up so we can start using this in an internal project.\n Bootstrap 2 is coming out tonight, did you guys we'll have a working version soon of the 2.0? What did you do finally, went rails or sass only?\n A lot of sass users aren't using compass, where did that idea come from? :/ Please don't make it rely on compass!\n Using Compass with Sass _is_ a huge advantage but I'm fine keeping the port more one-to-one, converting the Less mixins Bootstrap has.\n Is a huge advantage if you like and use compass, yeah.\n  So I was working on something just like this for Bootstrap 2 and then found yours :)  I've got a repository [here](https://github.com/kurbmedia/bootstrap-sass) (I've mostly focused on 2.0) setup which works both with and without rails (so you could use it with compass in non-rails projects).\n\nWould you be interested in just merging them for bootstrap 2 development? Having 100 forks of bootstrap for sass just seems silly since it would be better maintained together. \n\nI was planning on possibly extracting out some of the patterns a little better (so you could load bootstrap/patterns for all, or bootstrap/patterns/pattern for specific ones) as well as possibly setup a few additional variables so its easier to configure (instead of just changing blue/black etc since maybe you don't want blue or black buttons :) ).  I also sub-moduled twitter's repository to track their updates easier with a quick rake task that updates the submodule and copies over the javascripts etc. \n\nIf you'd like to do so just let me know and I can take a sec and fork your 2.0 branch and marge in some updates. \n Yeah theres definitely way too many :)  Theres also [this](https://github.com/anjlab/bootstrap-rails) and [this](https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails) too. I was thinking this was more of a scss port with rails option :)\n\nI'm definitely keeping with the original Bootstrap content, though I added a sub-folder for patterns etc so it was easier to find stuff, and to add a bootstrap/patterns file to load them all (the way it is originally you'd have to import all of them separately unless you are using the whole library).  As for compass, I've set it up so you can use it outside of rails, but definitely doesn't have a dependency on it (all the mixins for css3 etc are the direct ports). I'd prefer not to have compass as a requirement either. \n\nDefinitely seems like there should be some collaboration going on as far as maintaining a scss port, it would make it considerably easier to maintain :)  Id imagine a pure scss port with rails pipeline option for use in rails apps. I replied to that one thread you linked mentioning it.\n @brentkirby, changing the organization and deviating from the original Bootstrap is a bad idea for a direct port, I believe. But a version without Rails is essential for many, including myself, and I'd love to collaborate on bringing it together.\n\n@thomas-mcdonald, what do you say?\n I'm cool with that :)  Bootstrap is pretty lightweight so thats not too bad. I'm hoping they actually extract it out a little more so you can pretty much avoid any extra css unless you are actually using a particular feature/features. Also hoping they add some more configuration options (and more meaningful ones (buttonColor instead of simply \"blue\" :) ) which was the only other change I had started. \n\nI do tons of rails dev but also like the idea of rails being optional. Its easy enough to include the engine (and then setup load paths, as well as any helpers etc if you want them) if rails is available. If not, just make sure the files are available to sass.\n All of the scss files can just be created as partials (_something.scss) and stored somewhere besides app/assets or vendor/ (otherwise I believe rails / sprockets will try to pick them up).  Unless something has changed, as far as I know sprockets doesn't like them without the .css.scss naming convention.\n\nTo make them available to rails, in the engine just add:\n\n``` ruby\nconfig.sass.load_paths << path_to_the_stylesheets_dir\n```\n\nThat will make the partials directly available to sass and you can include them in your application.css.scss file and so on. Since you really only import them as needed, sprockets doesn't really need to know or care about them, as long as sass does. The images you could probably just place in vendor/assets/images, or add them in with `config.paths['app/assets'] << path_to_images`\n\nSo for example, you could store all of the .scss files in `lib/stylesheets/bootstrap`, then use\n\n``` scss\n@import 'bootstrap/partial_name'; \n```\n\nIn your files.\n\nIf you wanted to make it compatible with compass, something like the following should do the trick:\n\n``` ruby\nbegin\n  require 'compass'\n  Compass::Frameworks.register('bootstrap', :stylesheets_directory => path_to_stylesheets, :templates_directory => '')\nrescue LoadError\nend\n```\n\ntemplates_directory is optional, if you wanted to actually have it function as an official compass extension and include other assets (good if you're including any bootstrap images).\n @thomas-mcdonald, fair enough.\n\nSo it would be better to find another place to collaborate and port it where it wouldn't get obfuscated by rails. I don't see the rails integration as a part of a Twitter Bootstrap port from .less to .scss?\n If you ignore my changes to the actual scss files/structure [this branch](https://github.com/kurbmedia/bootstrap-sass/tree/bootstrap2) should work with and without rails (optionally compass).  If you did want to try and work on this I can fork a copy from here and merge in the rails specific stuff, just let me know!\n\nI am actually using it in a rails app now so I know that aspect of it works. I'd definitely love to put some helpers together for it as well as I think that would be helpful. That would make it easier to use than having to reference the site for html markup / classes etc... and easier to maintain when they hopefully get more semantic with their markup.... :)\n Bootstrap combined with Rails or some other framework sounds really nice. Although I haven't got any knowledge of Rails or the like.\n\nThey `could` (but probably shouldn't) probably work side-by-side in the same repository, but for people only interested in Bootstrap and not any specific backend-framework, it would only clutter the project of porting it to Sass.\n\nI definitely see the use for Bootstrap+backend framework, I'm just trying to say that it's not really related to the port of Bootstrap? :-)\n @oskarrough I'd agree, though since sass is such a first class citizen in rails these days I'd think its important. I'm hoping somehow (whether here or elsewhere) people could combine some effort in maintaining a more official sass port :) Keeping everything together would probably help that cause a little (so you don't end up with additional forks for rails / compass / and so on)\n\nAs long as the .gemspec doesn't require rails etc, you can easily store it all in the single gem without creating any headaches for non rails users. Same goes for compass if you wanted to allow it to be used as a compass extension but without that requirement. \n\nA good example is compass itself. Compass works with Rails 3.1 (pipeline) and Rails < 3.1, as well as standalone but doesn't require rails or anything (other than what it explicitly needs like chunky-png) be installed. \n  Whilst bootstrap is great, it uses classes instead of mixins, forcing loads of styling classes into our markup.\n\nI'd like to maintain a version of bootstrap that converts all of these classes into mixins. However, this will have two disadvantages:\n- Harder to maintain gem as changes to twitter bootstrap will need to be manually converted over\n- Not backwards compatible as anyone using the gem will have to switch their class markup over to including the mixins\n\nI'd like to fork this project to base these alterations on but the question is whether to push them back into this gem or release them in an entirely new one. What do you think?\n  Bootstrap-sass is being pulled in by RailsAdmin, I'm using Rails 3.1.3 and RailsAdmin master, running the rake assets:precompile task produces the following error:\n\n```\nstylesheets: rake assets:precompile\n(in /Users/billlazar/Sites/j3)\n/Users/billlazar/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180-patched/bin/ruby /Users/billlazar/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180-patched@ruby-1.9.2-head/bin/rake assets:precompile:all RAILS_ENV=development RAILS_GROUPS=assets\nrake aborted!\nUndefined variable: \"$baseline\".\n  (in /Users/billlazar/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180-patched@ruby-1.9.2-head/gems/bootstrap-sass-1.4.3/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/forms.css.scss)\n```\n True.

The generated output is now:\n\n`filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr='#FF4D5256', endColorstr='#FF6A7176', GradientType=0);`\n\nThank you for your hard work.\n  When creating a new Project the integration of the bootstrap-sass gem works fine.\n\nBut now I wanted to integrate it in an existing project. But there the gem is not include into the assetpath. I checked with:\n\nRails.application.config.assets.paths The gem paths are not included.\n\nAny ideas what went wrong?\n\nOn the Server I get the error:\n\ncouldn't find file 'bootstrap-dropdown' or every other file I try\n Did you add 'bootstrap-sass' to the Gemfile, and re-bundle?\n Yeah, Severall times. Also tried, bundle update. But nothing works. Server was restartet several times, too.\n  Is there a way to test this against the newer versions of `sass-rails`?\n If I'm reading this correctly this will allow bootstrap-sass to use sass-rails 3.2, correct?\n Just ran into this myself. Rails v3.2rc1 has sass-rails v3.2.2 as a dep.\n  Maybe this is just something I've messed up, so just wondering if anyone else isn't seeing alert div's appear since upgrading to 1.4.1 or 1.4.2 ? I rolled back to 1.4.0 and they appear again..\n Ok, my mistake, I've just created a test app and all three versions show the divs, I guess I have some javascript that only effects the newer releases.\n  After bundle installing this gem, where should the SCSS and JS files be? I figured in the vendor folder, but, I don't see them anywhere.\n Well, I'd like to modify variables.scss for one. I did see a stackoverflow question where you mentioned using @include and then overriding these variables. I'll look into doing this as it seems like the best option.\n\nMy path ended with the gem in my RVM setup as well. Since I'm using JRuby and compiling my Rails project to a WAR file for deploying to Tomcat, this could get a bit weird. During the compiling process, all of the gems get vedored. \n\nI am just weirded out by \"Rails Magic\" when I have no idea where the source files are. So for now, I've just cloned your repo and copied the contents into my lib and vendor folders.\n\nThanks,\n-Jim\n Looks good. I'm totally down with doing it the right way. I just needed to realize this is not a \"edit source file\" type situation. The default bootstrap is based on Less so the workflow is \"edit less file, recompile, (lather, rinse, repeat). This is just a new thing.\n\nLook forward to the cool things that can be built with this.\n  Step to reproduce: \n- Got to http://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php\n- Select Internet Explorer 8 (or 9) but not 7 or lower\n- Fill in http://rails-admin-tb.herokuapp.com/admin/comments/new\n- look at header and buttons color\n- use http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ as a decoy\n\nDiffing the CSS output manually, I found out: \n\nless:\nprogid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr='#333333', endColorstr='#222222', GradientType=0)\n\nsass:\nprogid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#333, endColorstr=#222, GradientType=0)\n\nProbably what's causing it.\n Arf, no problem. I wasn't sure what was causing it anyway.\nCan you bump a release soonish?\n\nThanks Thomas!\n Not yet:\n\nhttp://ipinfo.info/netrenderer/index.php w/\nhttp://rails-admin-tb.herokuapp.com/admin/comments/new\n\nSorry!\n Sup, bro.\n\nI want the MSDN compliance Gold\u00ae Logo on RailsAdmin's homepage, it would enlarge my penis very much.\n The buttons now look fine, but the toolbar's still broken. (I updated RA demo with 1.4.2 so you can have a look)\nSteve Ballmer said I can't have the badge. Bummer.\n Looks like the issue is with sass using the smallest representation for a given color, but IE needs the full value.  Per the (Sass reference material)[http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html]:\n\n\"Compressed style takes up the minimum amount of space possible, having no whitespace except that necessary to separate selectors and a newline at the end of the file. It also includes some other minor compressions, such as choosing the smallest representation for colors. It\u2019s not meant to be human-readable.\"\n I am going to look into the SASS compile options to see if there is anything that can be specified inline to prevent #222222 from being abbreviated to #222, but as a quick fix we included the following inline style in the head section of our layout:\n\n``` css\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n  .topbar-fix {\n    filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr='#333333', endColorstr='#222222', GradientType=0) !important\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\nThen include the topbar-fix class where needed, this class will then override the incorrect filter that SASS compiled. \n\nIt fixes the issue with the topbar gradient in IE 7/8.\n I found a blog article that may be able to work as a solution:\n\nhttp://pinds.com/2011/11/30/fixing-ie-gradients-with-rails-3-1-and-scss/\n\nThis might make it possible to fix inside of bootstrap-sass itself. I'll try to incorporate offline and see if it works...\n Cross posted there: https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/231\n\nThanks @rjackson for the investigation.\n Let's party. :cake: :cocktail:\n  Ruby needs a leading zero, so you can do the multiplication on patterns.css.scss \".labels\"\n i'm getting this with ruby 1.9.2\n\nruby-1.9.2-p290 :001 > 2 \\* .75\nSyntaxError: (irb):1: no .<digit> floating literal anymore; put 0 before dot\n2 \\* .75\n     ^\n(irb):1: syntax error, unexpected '.'\n2 \\* .75\n     ^\nwith  sass-rails 3.1.4 and sass 3.1.10 i'm not getting an error but the result is always 0px\n thanks!\n  Not sure exactly what change it is, but the version of the CSS included in this version of the gem is causing inactive tab content to be shown instead of hidden.\n  Adds '!default' to all variable declarations so we can override them, as done in the\ncompass port of bootstrap (https://github.com/hecbuma/compass-bootstrap). No need for generators or anything complicated, just set\nthe variables you want to override before importing bootstrap with\n'@import bootstrap'.\n\nEx.: \n    $gridColumns:       12;\n    $gridColumnWidth:   60px;\n    $gridGutterWidth:   20px;\n    @import \"bootstrap\";\n Exactly what I was looking for, thanks.\n  The condensed-table class wasn't working properly, looks like the tag selectors were changed to class selectors.\n  Styling on select boxes is not the same as it is in bootstrap proper. The so-called \"star hack\" was improperly implemented (missing the *) in the sass port.\n\nSee the [less source](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/lib/forms.less#L115)\n  When i use this directive i get the error below\ndifferent prefix: \"D:/\" and \"F:/xxx/app/assets/stylesheets\"\n  (in F:/xxx/app/assets/stylesheets/style.css.scss)\n\nseems @import can't load the scss file in different path on windows?\n  +1 on this.\n\nNot sure if you've seen this, but I have been using [a bootstrap modification](https://github.com/rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap) of [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) to work around this. \n FYI I don't know if you spotted this little GEM (https://github.com/stouset/twitter_bootstrap_form_for) - its pretty neat and JustWorked TM -- I am not the author but -- was wanting the same thing\n This would be great!\n +1\n I think some simple helpers would be useful. For forms, I am content using the simple_form bootstrap configuration.\n\nhttps://github.com/rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap\n  Are you tackling this? I'm a bit afraid to do it myself..\n RailsAdmin likes it :+1:\n  Specifically useful to me, the new JS supports tabs being switched from dropdowns.  I just copied from the twitter master branch.\n Where are you getting the 1.3.0 version from?\n\nThe JS in your repo doesn't match with what's linked from http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html. I agree that it's inconsistent to use master, were you pulling from the gh-pages branch? I think they made a JS update that's supposed to be with the 1.3.0 sass.\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/tree/gh-pages\n Oh, I see that there's a 1.3.0 tag that you probably used. I think you should stick with being consistent with the public documentation page rather than the releases, but it's up to you. \n I had used master in my initial pull, but I just diff'd them against the gh-pages versions and there are no differences.\n  You can't use bootstrap-sass without sass-rails, so you need to require it (gemspec dependency are not automatically required). When used from an engine, this ended up in weird races conditions when sass-rails wasn't present in main_app's Gemfile (which requires it by default).\n\nShould fix https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/issues/759\n Can't you just push 1.3.0.1 ?\nIt's not Semver anymore, but it sounds alright for our purpose. \n\nCheers\n    Twitter bootstrap has a file named preboot.less to set variable like gridColumns, but how can I do the same thing with bootstrap-sass. It seems that the imported file included in the file bootstrap.scss doesn't include preboot.scss.\n Try doing it like this: https://gist.github.com/1243355\n Sorry for the late response, I've had a crazy week with essays and my uni application.\n\n@grk's method should work pretty well for now. Creating an app-side `variables.css.scss` is something should be addressed in #1, but it appears `sass-rails` imports from the current directory if the file exists _before_ looking through the asset paths, meaning it will use the gem's copy of `variables.css.scss` with the default helper manifest. I think this won't be so much of an issue if I create a new manifest that will live in `app/assets` on `rake bootstrap:variables`, (something like `boostrap-custom.css.scss`) since it should (hopefully) look in `app/assets` before going to the gem file, but I haven't had time this week to check it out properly.\n", "text_all_count": 86206, "text_word_token": ["In", "some", "cases",
