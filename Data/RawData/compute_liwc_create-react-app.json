[You can disable eslint for particular lines.](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#disabling-rules-with-inline-comments)  My bad! I don't think it's possible today; the rule just isn't smart enough to determine whether your `setState` is constant across all renders. The built-in hooks are [defined as special cases](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/e180f656f364cd8a0e8441cb268f99a312265b21/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/ExhaustiveDeps.js#L161) in the lint rule. Reading [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14920#issuecomment-471070149), it seems like they suggest just adding it to the deps. I'm pretty sure that we're heading toward allowing adding rules to eslint, but this one will probably still be required. Probably not what you wanted to hear, but there it is!  @slgauravsharma your `browserslist` isn't configured correctly to support `ie 11`. Please refer to our docs to properly configure it for your supported browsers: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features#configuring-supported-browsers. @pitric please read the page I linked above in it's entirety. You will need to polyfill for ie support as mentioned in those docs. The docs also call out the need to delete `node_modules/.cache` when editing browserslist.  Sounds good to me!  Thanks for the PR, @kentcdodds.\r\n\r\n@mrmckeb you were recently working in this area for another PR yeah? It makes sense to me but wanted to double check and get your thoughts.  Thanks for the PR!  > Why is linting in the production build even enabled?\r\n\r\nI think our eslint config is pretty minimal, no style lints all code quality, almost always a good idea to enforce. When you don't want them to fire on specific sections of code [you can opt out](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#disabling-rules-with-inline-comments). That's the reasoning at least.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't need to install `eslint-plugin-react` at all because [it's a dependency of react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/317f5002233029942394df9e87183420359b18cf/packages/react-scripts/package.json#L51), so I'm not sure how you're getting that error.  I just run this as a step after build. [Here's a gist of roughly what my compression script looks like](https://gist.github.com/heyimalex/db6e734d1c4e0ac50e0dc8f2abeeae4e). Use case for me was compressing with zopfli and serving with nginx's `gzip_static`.\r\n [Zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli) gives better compression ratios than zlib at the expense of being slow (and so needing to run ahead of time). Younger me was pretty zealous with the optimizations :,) Closing as this is outside the scope of CRA. There's a few good suggestions above.  Yes indeed it is likely related to TypeScript issues. Closing in favor of #6792.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31048 is also related to #6792.  You might want to check out the [Popular Alternatives](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#popular-alternatives) section of our readme as we have a couple suggestions for other packages that might help you publish a react component.  You'll have to do a `npm ls core-js` to find out what package is bringing it in.   Related to #6980 I think, though the hyperlinker suggestion is new.  All I can tell from that screenshot is that it's a permission error. Is this on your home computer or a work computer? Maybe your sysadmin has disabled running cmd scripts. I don't know, it's not really related to create react app. The command that's failing is printed out in that screenshot, `yarnpkg add --exact react react-dom react-scripts --cwd C:\\searcher`, so you need to find out why that's failing.  CRA extracts styles into external stylesheets by default, so you shouldn't see a `<style>` tag in `./build/index.html`, or at least not a very large one. I think maybe it inlines when the styles are under a certain size.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, caching your index is a bad choice. You're going to want to be able to update your website without worrying about cache invalidation issues. It's not worth that pain over a literally 1KB request. All of the real savings come in caching css, js, and other static assets, which are probably at least three orders of magnitude larger.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you can just place the file in public and reference it in your `./public/index.html`. Read [this article](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/using-the-public-folder) for details.  How do users override TypeScript rules? That was the main driver of this change. Great suggestions, @bradzacher. Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf users don't extend `react-app` in their config, they won't get proper ESLint extension integration, but i guess we can cover that in the docs.  I don't believe Webpack will tree-shake your application code OOTB, but will tree-shake imported library code. There's some helpful information at https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/. It's possible that adding `sideEffects: false` may work, but be careful that this will remove side effect imports such as `import \"foo.css\"`. You can white list the file extensions as described in the link above.\r\n\r\nI recommend you use `require()` instead. Something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst loggerLink = isEnvDevelopment ? require('apollo-link-logger') : noopLink\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've ran into similar scenarios trying to add MobX loggers in development, but didn't want them included in production, and this pattern has worked well for me.  I think you're misunderstanding how css modules work. The `.btn-primary` style is global, so it'll be the same no matter what context you're using it in. Which is to say that in your codesandbox your buttons will either both be blue or both be yellow, but never mixed.\r\n\r\nAs for the order that they appear in the build, it's all dependent on the order they're imported. In your `index.js` you import `./Button` which imports `./button.module.scss`, and _then_ you import `bootstrap.min.css`. If you move the bootstrap import to the top of your `index.js`, you'll see both buttons turn yellow.\r\n\r\nRead [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance#Source_order) to learn more about how css styles are applied! Sorry if I'm misunderstanding the issue. Why do you think the css modules shouldn\u2019t be loaded first in this situation? You import your button and then asynchronously load bootstrap after. > the theme provider hasn't finished loading bootstrap yet, so there should be no CSS module included (but it is)\r\n\r\nCSS styles are applied in the order that they load. If you import button before bootstrap, it will be included before bootstrap. Im not sure what to say other than this is working as expected?\r\n  Hm, yeah it looks like it returns a zero exit code even when tests fail, at least for me on windows. I think that should probably be a bug? I found [jest/5841](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/5841), and putting `CI=1` before the call seems to work.  We don't polyfill anything by default. You can read more at https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features#supported-language-features  Take a look at #6924. Likely deleting node_modules and installing again with fix this for you.  `yarn why fsevents` shows an older version being installed for some other dependencies. Not sure if that's what's causing it because I can't recreate on my windows machine.\r\n\r\n```\r\n=> Found \"fsevents@1.2.8\"\r\ninfo Has been hoisted to \"fsevents\"\r\ninfo Reasons this module exists\r\n   - Hoisted from \"react-scripts#webpack-dev-server#chokidar#fsevents\"\r\n   - Hoisted from \"react-scripts#babel-jest#@jest#transform#jest-haste-map#fsevents\"\r\n=> Found \"react-scripts#fsevents@2.0.6\"\r\ninfo This module exists because \"react-scripts\" depends on it.\r\n```  [Previous discussion.](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/3965) I'm not really opposed to a flag that chooses either our current default or totally opaque hashes, but we generally push back on adding yet more configuration to CRA so no promises.  > but I have also tried importing the variable in a thunk, and the thunk doesn't suffer from this issue.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by this?\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert on the issue, but webpack ultimately bundles all the code together so it needs to be able to statically resolve imports at build time. I imaging doing that from variables is hard, but I know that webpack at least used to jump through hoops to try and figure out what you were importing with dynamic require statements. I don't have much to add other than you probably just shouldn't do this. Then I\u2019m going to close this as working as expected! We use dynamic imports for code splitting, so the import needs to be resolved at build time. The only situations where webpack could even theoretically resolve a js variable at build time are just as easy to write inline.  We already use `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` in this project. It internally uses the TypeScript compiler to do the type checking.  Ref: #6756.\r\n\r\nTemporary fix to bump `babel-jest` to fix preflight check error that was a result of a new version of Jest being released. Still need to address the bigger issue as part of #6756.\r\n > `babel-jest` is in the `react-error-overlay` package as well.\r\n\r\nI noticed that.  But now that you mention it not updating the pinned version in `react-error-overlay` may cause similar issues. I'll update it in `react-error-overlay`. \r\n\r\nI was also thinking was that we should probably update `jest` and the other related packages as well to match, but i was hesitant to do so since this is only a temporary fix.  Yeah I'm going to close this as working as expected. Unless this is causing issues for you somehow? Binding to `0.0.0.0` just tells webpack dev server to bind to all interfaces, which includes localhost. It doesn't really make sense to try to _access_ `0.0.0.0` because it's not an actual ip.  Did you delete your `node_modules` after editing `browserslist` as described in #6924? Ah i think i figured out what's happengin @amerej. The error overlay unfortunately doesn't work in browsers older than ie 11 currently it appears. The error overlay code loads before your application code, so your attempts to polyfill won't work. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5674). I'm going to close this in favor of the existing issue.\r\n\r\nBy the way, just a heads up that our default production `browserslist` includes `not dead`, which will exclude `ie 10`  if you were to add it before `not dead` in the list. You can see what i mean here: https://browserl.ist/?q=ie+9%2C+ie+10%2C+ie+11%2C+not+dead. Adding it after should work as expected though: https://browserl.ist/?q=ie+9%2C+ie+11%2C+not+dead%2C+ie+10  Case 1 was already fixed by #6862.\r\n\r\nCase 2 will be fixed by #6987.\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting! Please let us know if you find any other rules that are conflicting with TypeScript's type checking. It is difficult for us to test all the possibilities.  This is when running `npm test` i presume? I don't think https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2066 is related as webpack isn't used during testing, and `jsdom` isn't used during build (unless you explicitly imported the module of course). I wouldn't worry about the different versions of `jsdom` for now. What are you trying to do? What command are you running? Are you trying to import `jsdom` somewhere in your source code? I wouldn't expect `jsdom` to be loaded when running the dev server. Would you be able to create a minimal repo and link it to us so we can debug? I'm not able to repro from a fresh app.  Unable to repro, seems like it works fine?  Yeah, this is definitely expected behavior!  Sounds like a duplicate of #6924.  I'm unable to repro using stock CRA, could you give more details or an actual example project?  Any other details? Showing up during dev or after build? Are you seeing it in the inspector or actually in the build artifacts? Are you using css modules or scss? What's your browserlist say?  Before merging something like this in we will have to look into what options we have for extending our `typescript-eslint` config.\r\n\r\n/cc @mrmckeb   Hmm interesting. Looks like it's trying to launch Chrome but it's not available on your system...\r\n\r\nYou may want to try debugging the `node_modules/react-dev-utils/openBrowser.js` file. Take a look at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/4397d069d903c29927526d6fe4e7ba1b5edb136d/packages/react-dev-utils/openBrowser.js#L100 to see what it's trying to open.\r\n\r\nWorst case you should be able to configure the `BROWSER` environment variable to disable the automatic browser open logic. See https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration.  It doesn't appear your're using Create React App in your project (there's no `react-scripts` dependency).  I believe this pattern was causing issues in Windows. See #6313.\r\n\r\nFrom https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests#filename-conventions we support:\r\n\r\n- Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.\r\n- Files with `.test.js` suffix.\r\n- Files with `.spec.js` suffix.  cc @mrmckeb we will need to figure out the cleanest way to extend our typescript lint rules if we decide to support custom ESLint config file.

The reason is that function isn't implemented yet in node. https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/ is a good resource to see the support of newer APIs in different browsers and node versions. \n\nYou can either use a polyfill or avoid using the API until it is has better support.  You'll want to take a look at the 3.0 release notes. Likely you'll need to adjust your `browserslist` to add ie11 in development. `\"ie 11\"` should be enough. You can try using the default values from production as well as they will include ie 11 support.\n\nTry deleting your node_modules folder after making the change as I believe I've experienced Babel caching not detecting the new values   Glad to hear it worked. The default `prouduction` list is quite generous and does include `ie 11` already via the `>0.2%` item, so it's not expliclty needed (until the time when the usage is below 0.2% of course).\r\n\r\nHere is a handy tool to see the result: https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E0.2%25%2C+not+dead%2C+not+op_mini+all.\r\n\r\nThe `react-app-polyfill/stable` polyfill isn't required to get things working, as it will polyfill _ALL_ stable language features, while the `react-app-polyfill/ie11` module will only polyfill the bare minimum needed by React/CRA.  You're probably better off including react using a script tag instead. CRA doesn't sound like a good fit. It's a very strange use case.  You will have to try it to see if it works.  I believe this would add to the confusion folks already have differentiating this project from react itself.  Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Hey @NeoLegends. What you're saying seems reasonable. Likely option 1 makes the most sense but i'll put some thought into it and get back to this. Thanks for reporting! Seems the best option for now is to disable the `default-case` ESLint rule when using TypeScript, and suggest users use the `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` instead. Number 2 could be implemented in typescript-eslint as a rule. I don't know what value it would bring over the TypeScript compiler option. But this is outside the scope of CRA.\n\nRegardless for now we have a solution that isn't a breaking change.    I wouldn't recommend changing NODE_ENV from production for a staging build, as this is used by countless tools and libraries already and relies on the value being `production`.\r\n\r\nInstead you can create your own variable like `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` which can have default values in dev and prod through the .env file if you'd like, then simply set that environment variable when building your app for staging like `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=... npm run build`  Also see #6880 for more discussion on this topic.  The main change I can think of in 3.0 is --coverage used to turn off watch mode, but now that jest supports coverage in watch mode that's no longer the case.\n\nWe've always recommend to have the CI env variable set in your CI server if not already set as described at https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration. A number of CI providers will set this for you automatically.  Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Thanks!  Looks good. Thanks!  We were on an old version of Jest/jsdom previously which was lacking a `localStorage` implementation. Now that we're on `jsdom@14` it has an implementation for `localStorage` baked in.\r\n\r\nSome relevant info: \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6798\r\nhttps://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2318 This may be a good solution: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6798#issuecomment-412871616. It isn't overriding the implementation of `localStorage` so seems a bit cleaner than what's proposed in this PR.  Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Thanks! Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks! Thanks. Great first contribution!  This sounds reasonable. Want to start a PR and we can go from there?  Closing as a dupe of #6673.  Our ESLint configuration is not currently configurable (as has always been the case) and is documented here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor. Any changes you make to your configuration file will only affect your editor integration but not the Dev server or prod builds.\n\nWe haven't ever supported TSLint so I'm not sure how the other comments are related. @ztolley The baked in linting configuration is how we've always provided CRA, including adding new rules between major versions which is similar to what is being mentioned in this thread. This thread is slightly different in that some (including myself) were using TSLint prior to 3.0. To clarify, we did mention that the added TypeScript linting was in the [3.0 release notes](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0) and listed as a breaking change.\r\n\r\nI will discuss the possibility of extending the ESLint config with the team which i think would satisfy what most of you are looking for (i know i would use it personally), but i can't promise anything as it's a fairly significant change to how we've been providing CRA for a few years now. You're welcome to continue using TSLint alongside CRA if you wish. I do so myself for a few promise rules that aren't in ESLint yet.\n\nHow does CRA break your project? What rules are causing issues for you? @olee do you mind opening a separate issue that we can address? Your comments sound reasonable. There's a number of different discussions going on in this thread. The specific issues you raised are very concrete and actionable as they are actual bugs in our config.\n\nWe're discussing overriding ESLint config which could close this issue, but I would like to address the issues you described regardless. @dannycochran There isn't currently a PR up for extending the ESLint config yet, but internally we are looking into it.\r\n\r\n@bradzacher ESLint's `no-unused-vars` rule is disabled in the TypeScript rules. We use the `typescript-eslint` rule instead and it is set to `warn`. https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/57ef103440c24e41b0d7dc82b7ad7fc1dc817eca/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L82-L89\r\n\r\nThe linting rule provides a nicer DX as the TypeScript `noUnusedLocals` option causes the type checking to emit an _error_ which is quite disruptive during development. By using the linting rule and setting it to `warn`, we can still inform the developer in the terminal/dev tools, but not block them by showing the error overlay. However users are free to enable the compiler option if they wish. We have started a PR to extend ESLint config: #7036.\r\n\r\n@bradzacher I see what you're saying now. Thanks for clarifying. I'm not sure what the best path forwards is. Perhaps with #7036, users could disable that rule if it's causing issues for them. They could enable `noUnusedLocals` as a replacement, but it would be active during development currently which is a little unfortunate.  Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Thanks! Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks! That is intentional. We support two conventions as outlined at https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests#filename-conventions:\r\n\r\n- Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.\r\n- Files with `.test.js` or `.spec.js` suffix.\r\n\r\n(of course you can use TypeScript extensions as well)  Yeah you're definitely right that tsconfig.json supports it. We'll have to investigate this. Likely a JSON.parse() somewhere. For whomever investigates this, I recommend taking a look at https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin for similar logic. I did a few PRs there related to parsing tsconfig using the TypeScript API that may be helpful.\n\nHowever be careful as some of their functions will actually mutate the config. May not be worth using TS API potentially.  Fixes #6861. This turns off the ESLint rule for typescript files in favor of the typescript-eslint equivalent rule @mrmckeb yes that was intentional. I originally had copied that in from the recommended preset of typescript-eslint, but we don't have either of those ESLint rules enabled so they're not needed  Yeah this seems like a bug. Do you mind opening an issue in the typescript-eslint repo and linking back here so we can track? Sorry just realized that the rule you linked is the ESLint rule right (sorry on phone). May be worth posting in typescript-eslint anyways as they may need their own version of the rule. Ignore me @xaviergonz, hard to debug from phone \ud83d\ude1b.\r\n\r\nIt looks like there's already a `typescript-eslint` equivalent: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/no-useless-constructor.ts. \r\n\r\nI'll fix this up and it will be part of our next release. Thanks for reporting!  Fixes #6834.\r\n\r\nBump `@typescript-eslint` packages to a newer version that have removed the `typescript` peer dependency. Doh. Not quite this simple. Still a couple warnings left it looks like when checking out the CI logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning \"react-scripts > @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin > tsutils@3.10.0\" has unmet peer dependency \"typescript@>=2.8.0 || >= 3.2.0-dev || >= 3.3.0-dev || >= 3.4.0-dev\".\r\nwarning \"react-scripts > pnp-webpack-plugin > ts-pnp@1.1.1\" has unmet peer dependency \"typescript@*\".\r\n``` Alright looks like this might be the last one:\r\n\r\n> warning \"react-scripts > @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin > tsutils@3.10.0\" has unmet peer dependency \"typescript@>=2.8.0 || >= 3.2.0-dev || >= 3.3.0-dev || >= 3.4.0-dev\".

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  You'll have to elaborate more on what is causing issues for you. What is not working as you expect? Thanks for clarifying.\r\n\r\nYou're experiencing the massive difference between the original source code and the transpiled async/await output to support older browsers. You'll see what i mean if you were to disable source maps in your browser's developer tools.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that's targeting `ie 11`: https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&browsers=ie%2011&build=&builtIns=false&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=IYZwngdgxgBAZgV2gFwJYHsIwOYFNkAUAlDAN4BQMMATvgtVnPlABYEBEc66AdFOgFt2RcgF9y5AqEixEKDFmJlKMfhBDIauEAAdMIXDAC8MYAHdgqTXkJEA3GKLEgA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-2%2Cenv&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.4.3&externalPlugins=\r\n\r\nIn our 3.0 release that will be out in the next few days, your `browserslist` configuration in `package.json` will be used to determine what is needed to make your code supported in your target browsers. You can configure your development target browsers to something more modern such as `last 2 chrome`, but target older browsers in production to capture a broader audience. Targeting modern browsers using `browserslist` will make your in-browser development experience much easier and closer if not identical to your source code. You will need to use our 3.0 version to take advantage of browserslist. There's an alpha version out now and a stable version coming in the next day or two.  Thanks @arcanis.

Please follow the directions at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6475 to install the latest alpha (it sounds like that's what you're trying to do). There's no need to install `create-react-app` globally.  We ran into the same issue way back when adding TypeScript support when we added `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` as a dependency. We solved it by working with their team to remove the peer dependency on `typescript`.\r\n\r\n/cc @bradzacher do you think it would be reasonable to remove the peer dep on `typescript` in your packages? https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/443  This portion from the linked documentation is important:\r\n\r\n> :warning: Please keep in mind that even if they're almost equivalent, there's an important difference between spread and Object.assign: spread defines new properties, while Object.assign() sets them, so using this mode might produce unexpected results in some cases.\r\n\r\nAs @heyimalex mentioned we prefer sticking to the spec in most cases. Enabling `loose` mode would deviate from the spec. That's a good question. I think it may be a historical reason from a couple years back. I don't think the comment above it is true anymore either: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/4b5b76b79ffabcafc5fde02f583baceae6bd0446/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js#L157-L159.\r\n\r\nThe above comment isn't true unless `loose` mode is enabled. It will use the `objectSpread` helper instead of `Object.assign` when `loose: false`. It looks like the current behavior has been the case for quite some (years). Probably best to leave the current behavior which is true to spec, and clean up the config/comments as you mentioned.

If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  This is a typescript error indicating it can't find the types for this file. Can you try adding this to a `.d.ts` file in your `src` directory? You can use `src/react-app-env.d.ts` to test it out:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module '*.mp4' {\r\n  const src: string;\r\n  export default src;\r\n}\r\n```  The paths are correct when using `PUBLIC_URL` I assume?  reran it and passed  Can you double check that you're following the docs that you linked exactly?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the issue you linked make sure you don't have create-react-app installed globally before running the command.\r\n\r\n Can you clarify what is incorrect about the docs? I'm not following. There's isn't a need to explicitly install CRA globally anymore with `npx` available. Using npx ensure you always use the latest version of our CLI w whenever you are bootstrapping a new app.   The behavior of `lib` is no different than using the TypeScript compiler by itself. It only specifies which APIs that you \"claim\" will be available at runtime. This means you can use things like `Map`, `Set`, `Promise`, etc and TypeScript will know what those APIs are. You can customize `lib` to suit your project.\r\n\r\n`lib` doesn't provide any polyfills. You will need to do that separately depending on the APIs you're using and your target browsers. As a side note the TypeScript compiler isn't used in CRA to compile code, and is only used for type checking. `flatMap` may be available depending on your target browsers. We intentionally don't polyfill any APIs and leave it up to the developer to decide.\r\n\r\nProviding a restrictive default such as `es5` would mean a lot of users would be asking us why TypeScript complains `Promise`, etc isn't available. There's no great solution here so `esnext` provides a similar developer experience to javascript projects.

For example if you've got a CI build setup, you could set a version variable based on the version your CI generates when you run the build script.

It doesn't appear to be best practice to ignore the entire `.idea` folder. See https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544839-How-to-manage-projects-under-Version-Control-Systems The referenced example they show includes quite a number of excludes: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/c1b7904af6689bd01646f008b0561d4f19a0e972/Global/JetBrains.gitignore#L4-L21. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is something that we want to add to our default `.gitignore` as there are so many editors out there and each potentially have unique files to ignore.

This adds a new `react-app-polyfill/stable` module that can be imported from `src/index.js` which will include polyfills for stable language features, and integrates nicely with `@babel/preset-env` which uses `browserslist` to only include polyfills for the target browsers.\r\n\r\nSome more relevant info on this change: https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/docs/2019-03-19-core-js-3-babel-and-a-look-into-the-future.md#babel\r\n\r\n**Outstanding questions:**\r\n- In the [corejs@2 migration guide](https://babeljs.io/blog/2019/03/19/7.4.0#migration-from-core-js-2) it says\r\n  - > If you are using @babel/plugin-transform-runtime, you need to use the corejs: 3 option\r\n  - We currently have `corejs: false` so my sense is we can ignore this, but it would be helpful if someone with more knowledge of this plugin could chime in\r\n This was just merged in recently @brunolemos.

If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  Here's an example we get a preflight warning in our CI. We noticed this quite a bit the last few days as Jest has released a few new versions in quick succession. Each new release would break CI.\r\n\r\nThis is an example `npm ls babel-jest` output when everything works nicely:\r\n```\r\ntest-app@0.1.0 /c/projects/test-app\r\n\u2514\u2500\u252c react-scripts@3.0.0-next.b0cbf2ca\r\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 babel-jest@24.5.0\r\n  \u2514\u2500\u252c jest@24.5.0\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u252c jest-cli@24.5.0\r\n      \u2514\u2500\u252c jest-config@24.5.0\r\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 babel-jest@24.5.0  deduped\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever when a new version of jest comes out, let's say `24.6.0`, even though we pinned `jest@24.5.0` and `babel-jest@24.5.0`, `jest` references `jest-cli: ^24.5.0`. \r\n\r\nWhat would happen during `npm install` is we get `jest-cli@24.6.0`, which brings in `jest-config@24.6.0` and `babel-jest@24.6.0` which ends up in the root of `node_modules`, while putting `babel-jest@24.5.0` inside `node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/babel-jest`, and then when running CRA we get the preflight warning. > Thanks for forcing jest down our throats and not locking versions down so it could screw us.\r\n\r\nThat is a very unfair and unproductive statement. Most of our users are very happy with Jest. You are also free to use your own testing framework and/or eject if needed.\r\n\r\nWe _are_ locking dependency versions down in CRA in almost all cases. However we can't control how our dependencies reference other dependency versions, and in some cases we end up in these scenarios (which we are addressing).\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind that this project is mostly maintained by the community.

Can you confirm that you're using `react-scripts` `2.1.8`? I looked at the linked PR and it seems like this warning should only appear if the latest browser in `caniuse-lite` is more than six months old. I checked our versions of `browserslist` and its included version of `caniuse-lite` and both were released less than a month ago. I'm also unable to reproduce this error with a newly created project.\r\n\r\nThat said, this warning will still appear for people with older versions of `react-scripts` so we should try to get this fixed in `browserslist`.  We also have logic at the top of this file that is specific to the typescript project settings: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/1f4516dd714732c00d1c3d02f9e3a3a495b3f608/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L26-L34.

If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  You're correct that the docs describe a very specific output. I think we could improve the docs to be less specific rather than saying that there are exactly those 3 files emitted. The original intent was to give a little insight into why multiple files are created and what might be in them. \r\n\r\nTo rely on those exact file names (`1.[hash]...`) will likely cause issues as our dependencies change over time and is not something we recommend.\r\n\r\nIf somebody would like to submit a PR for the docs to broaden the the naming of the files as well as indicate that the names are not set in stone that would be great!

You can follow the instructions [in our docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started#quick-start) It's unclear if webpack is going to do anything to fix this issue or if it's just going to be fixed in npm. We'll keep an eye on the webpack issue and see if they release a new version before we publish 3.0 final.  I think a better place to mention this project would be on the Rails webpacker repo if people are looking for a server rendered option.  I understand where you're coming from, and not all decisions made in this project will suit everyone's needs. \n\nHowever we do provide ejecting as a route for those that really want to customize our configuration.

In the mean time would you like to submit a PR to update the link?  create-react-app requires node 8.10 or higher as [mentioned in the docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app). You will need to upgrade your version of node.  I noticed when running the CI tasks locally `tasks/e2e-kitchensink.sh` for example, that the verdaccio process is not killed when the `cleanup` function is run. This can cause weird errors when running the task back to back locally.\r\n\r\nWe should find and kill the verdaccio process in the `cleanup` function in each of our task scripts that use verdaccio. @santoshyadav198613 All yours!  Good catch. Thanks!  It sounds like setting the `project` property on `typescript-eslint` parser options has a significant performance impact (https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/243). Setting this property is important to enable the use of rules that require type info.\r\n\r\nThere is one rule we have enabled that i'm not clear if it requires type info or not (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`). The TSLint equivalent (https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/no-unused-variable/) requires type info.\r\n\r\nWe should determine whether `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` requires type info and use this info to decide whether to keep the `project` property set. There will likely be more rules that we will want to enable down the road that require type info, but hopefully by that time the performance issues will be sorted. > This can be backed up by looking at the code too; any rules requiring type info call [`getParserServices`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/063518380215fc0b2df777080d247fe222cf258d/packages/eslint-plugin/src/util/getParserServices.ts#L11-L29) to get access to the type checker\r\n\r\nThanks @jackwilsdon! That's a great tip to know if a given rule requires type info.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/360 will get merged so it's obvious in the docs.\r\n Since none of the rules we're currently using require type info we should remove this property for the time being. We can add it back when we need it and hopefully the performance issues will be fixed by then. https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/367 was just merged which apparently greatly improved lint times. However I agree probably best to comment it out for now until we introduce a rule that requires type info, and hopefully by that time any performance issues remaining if any are sorted.   @r0ughnex would you like to submit a PR?  Do you mind taking a static screenshot of the issue? It's hard to catch it in the gif.  Small update to the default templates to keep them consistent with the React docs.\r\n @amshtemp Yes they are different. We're probably going to change the TypeScript template back to an arrow function.  <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

We're working on coming up with a better long-term solution which we're tracking here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6392  Adding a config file for PostCSS or any other tool (Babel, webpack, etc.) is not in line with this project's goals. We do allow PostCSS to be adjusted via the `browserslist` in package.json but we're not planning to allow configuration beyond that at this time. Yes, that would be the case. That's also the case for Babel and webpack. The reason being we want to keep things simple for users and we only have the resources to support our primary config. If you start adding plugins there are suddenly a huge number of possible configurations and we don't have the bandwidth to support that.\r\n\r\nWe will be adding support for custom templates (as well as the existing support for custom scripts) so someone could always create a PostCSS template to use with Create React App in the future.  Yes we are planning to support this. Work is already underway at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6590  This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had any recent activity. If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  Do sourcemaps not solve your issue here? As @heyimalex mentioned i think this is a fairly unique use case that likely won't make it into CRA proper. I'd recommend ejecting/forking if you really need this behavior.  I agree that that's a bug. I'll try and repro sometime soon, but if you want to dig in [it looks like we use webpack's DefinePlugin](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/4704382558fe6f0d7564c72ce65d45e441a3ff61/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L572).  It looks like this is an ejected app with a customized webpack config. We don't have the resources to support ejected apps. Maybe try asking the webpack community for help or Stack Overflow.  This is currently being worked on in #6514.  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

Please fill out the issue template.  It looks like this was recently merged into jsdom: https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/pull/2398. We will have to wait until jest [bumps their version of jsdom](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/packages/jest-environment-jsdom/package.json).\r\n\r\nThere is nothing we can do on our end until Jest gets updated. Until then i recommend you try mocking it out yourself to get things going. Just a heads up that we're working on updating to `jsdom@14` which includes `MutationObserver` for create-react-app v3. You can follow the progress at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6654.  `npx create-react-app my-app` takes care of installing and running `create-react-app`. Installing globally is no longer necessary nor recommended.\r\n\r\nThanks for the PR though!  Thanks @MikeBeaton!  Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

I thought i remembered experiencing the same behavior with `react-scripts-ts`, but i may be mistaken.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's not really much we can do on our end from what i can tell.

I'm not sure a dual build is what we'll end up wanting. I know we've talked about doing dual build in the past, but i really think we should re-evaluate using `browserslist` in @babel/preset-env to accomplish this. We already use this for PostCSS.\r\n\r\nI've removed the `ignoreBrowsersList` and `targets` on @babel/preset-env and had great success on a number of projects. Related: #6198  That's fair @JoviDeCroock. I think these features can live in tandem. The Vue team took the approach of respecting `browserslist` by default and providing a `modern` mode that emits the dual build like you're working on here. It seems to be working well for them: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/browser-compatibility.html#polyfills-when-building-as-library-or-web-components >   Is this needed in development\r\n\r\nNo, i don't think this is needed in development.\r\n\r\n>   allow de-opt through cli, with a --legacy flag?\r\n\r\nI think exposing this via a `--modern` flag is a good starting point and allows us to release this in a minor release. We can consider making `modern` the default in a future major.\r\n\r\n Hmm this may be of use: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/93f57ac4a90e1d609183d00b77470c2e77bcaf63/packages/%40vue/babel-preset-app/index.js.\r\n\r\nDoesn't look like they're doing anything too special for modern? Maybe double check the outputted `.js` to make sure it looks as we expect. For example if you declare a `class` or an `async function()`, I would imagine that they would be left as is in the `.modern.js` bundles. > `useBuiltIns: 'usage'` as used in vue makes the diff more significant\r\n\r\nInteresting! I wonder why that matters. You're not importing `@babel/polyfill` or `core-js` or anything in your test are you? \r\n\r\nWe're probably not gonna see big differences in the default CRA template. It would be great if we could run these tests on a larger project instead.  Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  This should be fixed now. Please try the latest version of `react-scripts`.  I believe this to be a bug with `@babel/preset-typescript`. I've encountered the same issue myself. If you look at the emitted code you most likely have something like this: \r\n\r\n```js\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        Object.setPrototypeOf(this, {\r\n            pi: 3.14\r\n        });\r\n        this.pi = void 0;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd recommend you file a bug with them as you're right the behavior is not consistent with `tsc`. `tsc` would not emit anything in the constructor unless you explicitly specified a value for `pi`. And even then i'm pretty sure it emits at that top of the constructor before your code. @madeken were you able to track this down anymore? You may want to try with our [3.0 alpha](#6475) and see if newer versions of babel have fixed this issue. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

This issue has been updated with instructions on testing the new release. If you encounter any problems please create a new issue instead of commenting here. Thanks! > Any thoughts about supporting webpackPrefetch?\r\n\r\n@raRaRa please follow https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3319 for updates on this. We're waiting on https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/pull/1014 to support this. @raix That doesn't necessarily mean it will be included. We're considering it but we're also hoping to get 3.0 final out pretty quickly. Anything that isn't critical to the release and isn't ready will be pushed to a future version. That isn't a breaking change so it can be released at any time. > It seems that React @types are not installed by using --typescript flag.\r\n> \r\n> npx create-react-app@next --scripts-version=3.0.0-next.b0cbf2ca my-app --typescript\r\n\r\n@delasierra please file an issue. Let's keep this issue focused on the roadmap discussions. > Is v3.1.0 also available for testing?\r\n\r\n3.0 is not released yet. We're still in the alpha stage until we feel confident to release an official 3.0. You can watch this post for updates for when we release new alpha versions. Thanks for pointing that out @stefanmaric. I've cleaned it up. @devongovett it's a configuration file that is used by TypeScript's JavaScript language service. See http://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig. \n\nIf you still have concerns maybe we could create a separate issue and discuss?  The file isn't unique to VS Code. Code just happens to have TypeScript baked in \ud83d\ude1b. But yeah let's fire up a separate issue to discuss if you prefer!

That indicates that either a) we have a deeper issue in CRA, or b) there's an issue with Babel that should be raised.\r\n\r\nCan you try to check (in a _Hello World_ test) if you use the Babel key in a `package.json`, Babel picks up the config? If not, we need to raise this with the Babel team. If so, then I think we need to dig around within CRA a little more - I can help you to do that.

For those that need this resolved immediately you can try out our alpha build by following the instructions over at #6475. Closing this for now as it should be resolved and will be part of the 3.0 release.  This could potentially have a negative impact on bundle size.

So while some people would want to exclude these folders I think just as many people would want to include them. I'd rather leave this as is.

If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  ESLint is _not_ currently running on `.ts` or `.tsx` files. Any errors you're seeing are from the TypeScript compiler type checking. If you're seeing errors today it's likely because it's not valid TypeScript. Interesting! Here's our ESLint setup in webpack as of 2.1.8: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/c17e25bf7f9dd60c49cd491535114beb5592ff81/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L307.\n\nNot sure how it would be running on typescript files.

Can anyone confirm the stability of the metadata proposal? What stage is it in? Last time I checked I seem to remember it not having been proposed yet as they were waiting for decorators to be later stage? \n\nWe typically don't support early stage proposals in CRA as they are too volatile. For example the decorators proposal changed drastically during the first couple stages.  This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

I just learned that enabling any of these progress plugins introduces a significant performance penalty in webpack. They all require webpack to emit progress information during the build and that slows things down quite a bit.

I've created #6608 which adds `browserslist` support for @babel/preset-env. It adds `useBuiltIns: 'entry'` which supports importing @babel/polyfill in the entry point of your application, while respecting your `browerslist` to only include the polyfills necessary by your target browsers.

Once that\u2019s done I think we\u2019re ready to merge. Thanks! I'm just looking into the unit test failures. They're not related to your changes but I'd like to fix them before we merge. I think there's overlap with the babel plugin here and the work being done in #6219? If so we probably want to remove that change from this PR and focus on the ESLint plugin side of things. @ianschmitz Are you referring to the loose mode destructuring part? I don't think #6219 is going to make it into 3.0 so I'm thinking we include this for now and then remove it in #6219. What do you think? @iansu yes i'm referring to the babel plugin that was added here. If we don't think #6219 will make it in for 3.0 then it probably makes sense to include it and later remove like you said. Thanks!

If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  We're not necessarily opposed to supporting Electron (as long as the changes are minimal) but it's also not a high priority and we don't really have any maintainers who are Electron experts. So there isn't really anyone driving this and we don't currently have the bandwidth to take it on ourselves. This change is really simple and makes running CRA under electron _workable_. I've personally needed exactly this in the past, and ejected to make it work. For my use case it was really as simple as the proposed commit.\r\n\r\nHowever, electron is weird. I'm pretty sure that things like importing native/compiled external modules will break at runtime, and I'm _sure_ there are other gotchas I can't remember right now. Getting an environment together to get `start` and `build` to actually work, while not the most difficult thing in the world, does mean that the user is going to be on their own to scaffold stuff, and to debug stuff when things go awry.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm trying to say is this change is great if you know what you're doing, but it's definitely not \"supports electron out of the box\".\r\n\r\nAll that to say I _kinda_ support this, but only if the flag is buried on the Advanced Configuration page with something that explicitly says we don't _actually_ support electron. Maybe choose an env var name that conveys this, `EXPERIMENTAL_ELECTRON_TARGET`.  This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

Closing in favor of #6614 as this PR is quite out of date.  Thanks for the PR but this doesn't really seem like an improvement to me. It basically just says the same thing as before but with more words.  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  I believe this has already been fixed since we've bumped the svgr version number. Closing. Let us know if you still have issues!

This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n We have no plans to implement this right now. We don't want to add options to customize our webpack config and we avoid making changes to accommodate individual libraries or tools. You can still use Emotion, or countless other CSS-in-JS libraries, without this.  `baseUrl` is now supported in `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json`. Check out #6475 and install our alpha release if you want to try it out!  @JoviDeCroock This is still something we'd like to have in the future. That webpack plugin looks like it could be useful. I think as @Timer said previously, we'd like to have this enabled by default and build both the modern and legacy bundles all the time and just let the browser decided which one to use.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the best way to proceed though. This PR is a bit out of date so it might be easier to start fresh. @prichodko Is this still something you're interested in working on? Perhaps the two of you could coordinate and work on it together.  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  @stipsan, if you could rebase this one (there's a small conflict), we can merge this in for 3.0! Thanks again.

However, if the function `setState` is being provided by `useState`, this dependency is not necessary and the lint doesn't raise any warning.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make my function not raise any warning, as `useState` does?\r\n\r\nBtw: My Custom hook look like this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wviveiro/react-hook-setstate/master/index.js\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n Hi @heyimalex ,\r\n\r\nActually I am trying to disable eslint for a function, not a line. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\nconst [state, setState] = createState({count: 0}); // This is my custom hook\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    setTimeout(() => setCount(count+1), 100); // setCount will not trigger react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n    setTimeout(() => setState({count: count+1}), 100); // setState will trigger react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nconst myFunction = useCallback(() => {\r\n    setCount(count+1); // setCount will not trigger react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n    setState({count: count+1}); // setState will trigger react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n}, [])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like my custom hook not to trigger the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` like a standard react hook, it doesn't matter how many **useEffects** and **useCallbacks** I added it in. That's unfortunate, but good to know!

I create the app with \u2018npx create-react-app my-app \u2013typescript\u2019, \u2018npm install react-app-polyfill\u2019 and add Internet Explorer to the browserslist option. It runs in Edge and Chrome but will not start in Internet Explorer. \r\nAm I missing something?\r\n @pitric did you run yarn start/npm start or yarn build/npm run build?  Did you add the ie11 polyfills?  It doesn't sound like you did.  Please include *full* details. After some experimentation, I found the minimum steps require to run in Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\n1. Create the app with: npx create-react-app my-app \u2013typescript\r\n2. To the browserslist development in package.json  add: last 1 ie version\r\n3. Delete: node-modules\r\n4. Reinstall react: npm i \u2013save react\r\n5. Run the app: npm run start\r\n\r\nNo need to add any polyfills since according to the documentation: \u2018The browserslist configuration controls the outputted JavaScript so that the emitted code will be compatible with the browsers specified.\u2019\r\n @ianschmitz thanks Ian you are right. You do need the polyfills for more advanced applications, but the basic one works without them. You can delete node-modules to delete the cache or as you point out you can also delete node_modules/.cache directly. @ianschmitz @bugzpodder  @petetnt i tried many ways as mentions in documentation but not getting success\r\n this is my browserslist and i configured as mentions in official docs:-\r\nbrowserslist\": {\r\n    \"production\": [\r\n      \">0.2%\",\r\n      \"not dead\",\r\n      \"not op_mini all\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"development\": [\r\n      \"last 1 chrome version\",\r\n      \"last 1 firefox version\",\r\n      \"last 1 safari version\",\r\n      \"last 1 ie version\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\ni tried  \"last 1 ieversion\",  \"IE 11\", in node_modules delete cache and all stuff but still ie is not loaded (not working)\r\n\r\nlastly i found and add index.html in ` <script src=\"https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js\"></script>` now its working. please let me know if i am not wrong or any suggestions is more appreciable.\r\n What's your index.js? did you add the polyfills there? @slgauravsharma I downloaded your repo and followed the following steps according to the documentation:\r\n\r\n1. Add Internet Explorer to the browserslist: last 1 ie version\r\n2. Delete: node_modules/.cache\r\n3. Install the polyfill: npm install react-app-polyfill\r\n4. Add the imports: react-app-polyfill/ie11 and react-app-polyfill/stable\r\n5. Run the app: npm run start\r\n\r\nAfter all of this it still did not run in Internet Explorer, so I closed Visual Studio Code and re-opened it and it worked. \r\n i sovle it by @ianschmitz's solution:\r\n1. edit browserslist in package.json\r\n\"browserslist\": {\r\n        \"production\": [\r\n            \">0.2%\",\r\n            \"not dead\",\r\n            \"not op_mini all\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"development\": [\r\n            **\"ie 11\",**\r\n            \"last 1 chrome version\",\r\n            \"last 1 firefox version\",\r\n            \"last 1 safari version\"\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n2. delete .cache in node_modules  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\nreact-error-overlay\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Environment</summary>\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.5\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 12.2.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 74.0.3729.157\r\n    Firefox: 66.0.5\r\n    Safari: 12.1.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-scripts: 3.0.1 => 3.0.1 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 3.0.0\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIn a create-react-app typescript project:\r\n\r\n1. Start the development server \r\n2. Make a typescript error in any file (```let a: string = 0``` for example).\r\n3. The error overlay displays the error, however clicking on the exception does not navigate to the file in the text editor as with other webpack errors.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nClicking on the error overlay navigates to the file in a text editor.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe error overlay isn't clickable.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nReact-error-overlay tries parsing the exception by looking for a filepath in the error message. This is handled in [parseCompileError.js](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/4704382558fe6f0d7564c72ce65d45e441a3ff61/packages/react-error-overlay/src/utils/parseCompileError.js), where the filepath regex matches only relative paths:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst filePathRegex = /^\\.(\\/[^/\\n ]+)+\\.[^/\\n ]+$/;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas typescript errors use absolute paths. As discussed in https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6502#discussion_r259686344 making the paths relative has some drawbacks so it would be best to keep them absolute.\r\nAlso TS error locations are specified like `(line,colon)` so we would need to add that format to the lineNumberRegexes array.\r\n\r\nI can submit a PR for this if that's okay.  In some situations, it's much easier to create a \"blacklist\" than a \"whitelist\" so including `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` makes a lot of sense to me. I've made this change locally and it works as expected.  The new ESLint TS rules are a little cumbersome for typedefs. We have 100s of places where we do things like the following as we like to have our types declared at the top of our files.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type AppProps = ReturnType<typeof mapStateToProps> & typeof mapDispatchToProps;\r\nexport const mapStateToProps = (state: RootState) => ({  initialized: state.initialized });\r\nexport const mapDispatchToProps = { initialize };\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaking the changes here in local eslint-config-react-app/index.js fixes the warnings for TS(X) files.\r\n\r\n Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Thanks! Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks!  My setup is CRA 3 with react-app, airbnb and prettier eslint config.\r\n\r\nWhat I have is pipeline with stages that installs dependencies, build, lint, snapshot test and e2e cypress test (and deploy).\r\n\r\nBut right now, I do linting twice, because npm build only use react-app lint rules so I have to separate stage for linting.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion here I have a feeling that there is no planned support for custom eslint rules, so would it be possible to at least have option to disable linting during build?\r\n\r\nBuilding takes almost 4 minutes on CI in our project so it would be nice if there were some ways to speed it up. Have you tried to set `CI=false`?\r\nAs a command - `CI=false npm run build` +1\r\nWhy is linting in the production build even enabled? When I create a production build I get the error \r\n```sh\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n./src/index.js\r\nError: Failed to load plugin react: Cannot find module 'eslint-plugin-react'\r\nReferenced from:\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Array.reduceRight (<anonymous>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[One suggestion is to move eslint-plugin-react to production deps](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/2270) which I will definitely not do!\r\nIf anyone ecounters the same error with `\"eslint-plugin-react\": \"^7.13.0\"`: downgrade it to `\"eslint-plugin-react\": \"^7.11.0\"` and the build process works again! I have `eslint-plugin-react` in the `devDependencies` because if I remove it I get a warning by vscode:\r\n```sh\r\nFailed to load plugin react: Cannot find module 'eslint-plugin-react' Referenced from: C:\\projects\\may-app\\.eslintrc.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the config of my `.eslintrc.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"],\r\n  \"env\": {\r\n    \"browser\": true,\r\n    \"jest\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you think I can ignore this warning? I have configured vscode to automatically lint and format the code when saving.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nable to gzip files during build\r\n Can you clarify the use case?   I just  rely  on nginx to do gzip for me:\r\nhttp://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_module.html#gzip Ideally, you should pre-compress built files using the maximum brotli/gzip compression level and then use nginx's `brotli_static` and `gzip_static` options to serve those precompressed files. You can try my [`precompress`](https://github.com/silverwind/precompress) module made exactly for this purpose:\r\n\r\n```` bash\r\nnpm i precompress\r\nnpx react-scripts build\r\nnpx precompress -v build\r\n````\r\n\r\nTo get brotli to work in nginx, you will need the `ngx_brotli` module.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

This allows users to extend the base ESLint config, so long as it is extending the `react-app` config.\r\n\r\n**Config in `package.json`**\r\nInitially, this is limited to users that use `package.json` to configure ESLint. We can extend this later, but it will have performance implications as we would need to:\r\n- Find which config file the user is using.\r\n- Read that file, and confirm that it extends the `react-app` config.\r\n- Set that config to `eslint-loader`.\r\n\r\nEslint provides tooling to support this, but again, this will impact performance.\r\n\r\nUsers could work around this, by setting the following in `package.json`:\r\n ```json\r\n{\r\n  \"eslintConfig\": {\r\n    \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"./my-eslint-config.js\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\nOnce this approach is approved, I'll update our ESLint documentation to outline usage. The reason config wasn't configurable in the first place is to prevent hyper-opinionated configs full of styling rules from showing up in the browser overlay integration.\r\n\r\nIf we allow arbitrary configs we should make sure that this is still the case. E.g. at least adding Airbnb config shouldn't make a wrong indentation appear as a build error. Maybe we could force the linter to always have `eslint-config-prettier` applied on top so that styling rules are still force-disabled. However, there are still a bunch of rules in popular configs that are too restrictive, and we want to make it hard to enable them in the default setup. If you're enforcing that users still include `react-app` then how come you don't just enable it by default instead of making people add it in when they extend?\r\nSeems less error prone for the user if you do something like\r\n`if (!extends.includes('react-app')) { extends.unshift('react-app') }`\r\n\r\nWhilst it's not technically required, pretty much every plugin (and base eslint rules definitely do) follows the exported config structure defined by eslint:\r\nhttps://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#rule-basics\r\n\r\nThis means that every rule should have a `meta.type` field on its definition which can help you figure out what should be shown in the overlay.\r\nThe value should be one of `\"problem\" | \"suggestion\" | \"layout\"`.\r\n\r\nI would just setup the hard rule that a plugin must have type set to `\"problem\"` to show up in the overlay. But you might want to review the rules you've got enabled by default to double check that.\r\n\r\nSimilarly there is a `docs.category` field, but that one is a free string, so you can't really rely upon its value. A lot of plugins follow eslint's lead and go with something along the lines of `'Best Practices' | 'Stylistic Issues' | 'Variables' | 'Possible Errors'` >I would just setup the hard rule that a plugin must have type set to \"problem\" to show up in the overlay. \r\n\r\nThis sounds reasonable to me. @gaearon I think we're all on the same page. I personally don't like breaking builds unless it's a serious issue, but we're trying to allow people to have more control over this.\r\n\r\nWe can use recommend people to set `warn` for anything that shouldn't break the build.\r\n\r\n@bradzacher, as @ianschmitz mentioned, it's about consistency with IDE integration. I'd prefer that users know what's going on - because they explicitly set that config - rather than us adding things in the background.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear more about your idea @bradzacher, as I can't see a simple way to configure that in `eslint-loader` or ESLint itself. We don't want to be passing all rules.\r\n I was weighing in from a linting perspective! I don't have much of an idea of CRA/Webpack.\r\n\r\nI had a quick look and there's a lot of codepaths - I'm not sure how it would work within this project.\r\n(pure JS at this scale is hard to figure out exactly without types or codebase knowledge...)\r\n\r\nWith my lack of knowledge of what CRA error output looks like (I've never properly used CRA), it looks like it could be a bit of a larger change across a number of files?\r\nI wasn't sure how the errors get passed via the socket to your webpack client (is this an automatic webpack thing?) Sorry @bradzacher, I misunderstood and thought you meant we could configure ESLint that way. \r\n\r\nI think it would be a fairly large change... And I'm not sure of the performance and maintainability impacts it might have. @gaearon @ianschmitz What do you think? @gaearon not wanting opinionated linting to break builds is an _opinion_, though.  On my project, I want to enforce code style, and have good reasons to believe it should be on save rather than on commit which I don't think I need to go into here.\r\n\r\nCRA is awesome, but if I want to lint aggressively, I need to maintain a fork, or eject, both options of which are way over the top for something so simple.\r\n\r\nAt least give us the _option_. Thanks for this PR, this is useful when you migrate from an older codebase (using CRA v1 for example), and need to convert a few eslint errors to warnings, just to `npm run dev` at least\r\n\r\n@mrmckeb Could we allow also an `.eslintrc` (jsonc, the 'c' is for comments that are allowed) file?\r\nNot a big deal though, it'd be ok in `package.json` As @caub says, except also `.eslintrc.js` - because I like commenting why a rule is there. > The reason config wasn't configurable in the first place is to prevent hyper-opinionated configs full of styling rules from showing up in the browser overlay integration. If we allow arbitrary configs we should make sure that this is still the case. E.g. at least adding Airbnb config shouldn't make a wrong indentation appear as a build error.\r\n\r\n@gaearon Isn't this configurable by the developer? Eslint rules differentiate between warning or error (`1` or `2`), so a developer gets to choose what shows up in the overlay? I think that's currently how it's set up now: e.g. `exhaustive-deps` shows up as a warning in the browser console, not as an error in the app overlay.\r\n\r\n> Maybe we could force the linter to always have eslint-config-prettier applied on top so that styling rules are still force-disabled.\r\n\r\nI also don't think we should mandate prettier usage. [The VSCode extension is actually currently broken ](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/issues/763)which makes it very difficult to use while working locally.\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't understand why CRA cares what a user does with their codebase after initialization, and should only provide guard rails for things that would break other parts of the CRA build tools. For instance, we cannot import files outside the `src` directory. This is a necessary opinion for CRA to function properly. But I can add custom linting rules and it has no impact on the rest of the toolchain, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nIMO trying to mandate linting rules is no different than mandating usage of, say, RXJS instead of Redux. This seems out of scope for CRA.\r\n\r\n@caub thank you for doing this. I think it would be good to support `.eslintrc` and `.eslintrc.js`, per @Asday 's comment, but that could certainly be done in a followup to at least unblock folks for now. > The VSCode extension is actually currently broken which makes it very difficult to use while working locally.\r\n\r\n@dannycochran - The VSCode extension isn't technically broken, `prettier-eslint` is broken (using the option `prettier.eslintIntegration` switches the extension to use `prettier-eslint` instead of `prettier` directly).\r\n\r\nNote that `prettier` and `prettier-eslint` are separate tools, the latter tool integrates the two tools together at fix time.\r\n\r\nAlso note that if you install the eslint extension, turn off `prettier.eslintIntegration`, and turn on `eslint.autoFixOnSave` - it will work around the issue. @caub We could do that for sure. We could release without and perhaps drop it in as an update - I think at this stage we need to get _something_ out, and we can then _\"enhance\"_ once we've proven that it's working.  I have code like this: \r\n```js\r\nimport apolloLogger from 'apollo-link-logger';\r\n\r\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';\r\nconst noopLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => forward(operation));\r\n\r\nconst loggerLink = isDevelopment ? apolloLogger : noopLink;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- This is only one usage of `apolloLogger` in the code.  \r\n- `loggerLink` resolved in the build time and for production build references to `noopLink`.\r\n- So, `apolloLogger` should be unused variable and therefore `'apollo-link-logger'` is unused dependency. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, but I still can find code of `apollo-link-logger` in the build even if it's not used in the real code. I am curious it's done intentionally or it's just a feature of CRA webpack configuration or it's webpack issue?\r\n\r\nBest,  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes. When I include Bootstrap as described in the User Guide, and then override a global Bootstrap style in any of the CSS modules, this CSS style is overridden by the global styles\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nYes, I don't think this has anything to do with the dependencies.\r\nnpm version is 6.4.1\r\nnodejs version is 10.15.3\r\nreact-scripts version is 3.0.0\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\nCSS Modules, CSS import order\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.3 - C:\\software\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: Not Found\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - C:\\software\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: 42.17134.1.0\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.17134.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n    react-scripts: 3.0.0 => 3.0.0\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install latest create-react-app\r\n2. Install bootstrap 4 and import the global styles in the App component\r\n3. Create a new Button component and add it to the App component using bootstrap classes, for example `<button className=\"btn btn-primary\">button</button>`\r\n4. Create a css module file and import it in your Button component\r\n5. Override some styles from bootstrap, for example: `:global { .btn-primary { background: yellow; } }`\r\n6. The button should now be yellowbut it is NOT (still the default blue color from bootstrap). \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe CSS modules should be imported later in the document after all the global styles.  I think it makes sense that the global styles should be imported first and THEN the CSS modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe CSS module styles are ignored. Well not completely ignored but overridden by global styles from Bootstrap which are imported later in the document. I checked the compiled source and indeed the styles from the CSS module are generated BEFORE global styles from Bootstrap.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/5zwon04xrk\r\n\r\n @heyimalex I updated the demo app at CodeSandbox to show you my problem:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/5zwon04xrk\r\n\r\nI use a theme provider and it seems like the problem is that I load the styles asynchronously using import():\r\n\r\n`import(\"./defaultTheme\").then(success);`\r\n\r\nI don't know how to solve this right now. I thought this was the solution but it did not work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n if (themeLoading) {\r\n      return \"Theme loading...\";\r\n }\r\n return children;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CSS module still gets loaded first even if I don't render the children. @heyimalex The moment I import Button.js, the theme provider hasn't finished loading bootstrap yet, so there should be no CSS module included (but it is) - the provider doesn't render the children anyway (it returns a string `\"Theme loading...\"`). There's no way I can override the bootstrap styles in the css module using `:global {...}` if the global style is loaded asynchronously. That's the problem I think. Actually the only way to override it would be by using a custom class of course. Yeah I think you're right. Anyway thanks man!  I have a shell like below, and I hope it Interrupt itself when the test coverage going fail, it work when I use react-scripts in version2.1.8, but it doesn't work  after I update react-scripts to version3.0.0, I found the variable $? return 1 even my tests have some fail case, is it a bug or just some function be changed? How could I get my hope function?\r\n```\r\nreact-scripts test --silent --coverage --watchAll=false\r\nif [[ $? > 0 ]]; then \r\n   echo $?\r\n   echo \"do something\" ; exit 1;\r\nelse\r\n   echo $?\r\n   echo \"do something\" \r\nfi\r\n``` @heyimalex  your way work, but the colors of word in thermal disappear when I use CI=1  After ejecting, I don't see any reference in package.json or .babelrc to any of them. \r\n\r\nIs there a reason to not use them? what is the alternative?  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.4\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6920HQ CPU @ 2.90GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.1.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.6.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm Using npm for this project!\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 74.0.3729.131\r\n    Safari: 12.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.3 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.3 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-scripts: 3.0.0 => 3.0.0 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. yarn build\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAll js files should be compatible with IE11.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nTemplate literals aren't transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**browserslist**\r\n```\r\n\"browserslist\": {\r\n    \"production\": [\r\n      \">0.2%\",\r\n      \"not dead\",\r\n      \"not op_mini all\",\r\n      \"ie 10\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"development\": [\r\n      \"last 1 chrome version\",\r\n      \"last 1 firefox version\",\r\n      \"last 1 safari version\",\r\n      \"ie 11\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**index.js**\r\n```\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the [changelog for 3.0](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#browserslist-support-in-babelpreset-env), it should fix everything for the defined browsers - in this case IE11.

I doesn't work for me. So we just found out that it was an npm package which caused the issue. It doesn't properly build to es5.  It's a vulnerability issue. tar package under react-scripts > fsevents is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite which is a high vulnerability. Please update all the tar dependencies under react-scripts package to 4.4.2 and above to remediate the issue. According to [this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6790) upgrading to 3.0 should solve the issue. But still the vulnerability exists.  Current generated class names are too long and messy. It would be great if we have some way of customize it. For example `[hash:base64:5]` like parcel-bundler with postcss-modules.\r\n\r\nFacebook and Google already does it this way.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nI think Yes, but the bug is so absurd that I must be wrong.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nI'm on a brand new CRA.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nI was unable to reproduce on CodeSandbox, but able to produce in my two terminals on windows:\r\n<details><summary>WSL</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n   OS: Linux 4.4 Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n   CPU: (8) x64        Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz\r\n Binaries:\r\n   Node: 10.9.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.9.0/bin/node\r\n   Yarn: 1.10.1 - /mnt/c/Users/Zhi/AppData/Roaming/npm/yarn\r\n   npm: 6.9.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.9.0/bin/npm\r\n Browsers:\r\n   Chrome: Not Found\r\n   Firefox: Not Found\r\n npmPackages:\r\n   react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n   react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n   react-scripts: 3.0.0 => 3.0.0\r\n npmGlobalPackages:\r\n   create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Git Bash on Win10</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n  OS: Windows 10\r\n  CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 10.13.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n  Yarn: 1.10.1 - ~\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\yarn.CMD\r\n  npm: 6.4.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\nBrowsers:\r\n  Edge: 44.17763.1.0\r\n  Internet Explorer: 11.0.17763.1\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n  react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n  react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n  react-scripts: 3.0.0 => 3.0.0\r\nnpmGlobalPackages:\r\n  create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  create a new app: `npx create-react-app test`\r\n2.  create a `data.json`in /src :\r\n```json\r\n{\"message\": \"Hello World\"}\r\n```\r\n3. add dynamic import in App.js:\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n    let path = './data.json';\r\n    const greet = res => {console.log(res.message);};\r\n    import('./data.json').then(greet); // this works\r\n    import(`${path}`).then(greet); // this works too\r\n    import(path).then(greet); // this doesn't work\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n(I also tried `componentDidMount`, same issue)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nsee \"hello world\" 3 times in console\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nsee two \"hello world\"s, and one `Error: Cannot find module './data.json'`\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\nSee above.

IBM Cloud Docker Instance\r\n\r\nnpx: installed 91 in 18.872s\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.4 Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 11.11.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v11.11.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.15.2 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.7.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v11.11.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is a very large project with hundreds of components.\r\n\r\n    \"start\": react-scripts start\", (5-6 min)\r\n    \"build\": \"tsc && react-scripts build\" (~53min),\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI upgraded my existing installation to the newest version of React which supports Hooks and integrated TypeScript which caused the development server to slow down on first launch; with the console displaying the following. \r\n\r\nFiles successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results...\r\n\r\nWhen I commit and merge the code, a deployment build is spun up in a Docker instance which takes almost an hour to complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the production build to take no more than 10 min.\r\nThe development server should also launch a bit quicker. How long it took without TS? Both `start` and `build`?\r\n\r\nHow long it took to finish just `tsc` ? We had a similar issue as we are using custom create-react-app fork with enabled tslint. Looks like project grows to the size, where `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` slows down really badly. We solve it by disabling tslint but you are using the default create-react-app which is not using tslint. \r\n\r\nMaybe @johnnyreilly could help us with this as message _\"Files successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results...\"_ means that create-react-app is waiting for result from `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`.\r\n\r\nFor your information, we are currently not listening to `fork-ts-checker-service-out-of-memory` event but as you mentioned that build actually finished, then I think it is not an issue. I'd be interested to know how `tsc` alone performs and whether this is related to the regression in performance with TS 3.4. The ticket mentioned 3.3 so perhaps not. \r\n\r\nI've never encountered a build that performs that badly before. I'm also curious that this script is first running tsc and *then* running react-scripts:\r\n  `\"build\": \"tsc && react-scripts build\"`\r\n\r\nCan't guarantee I'll be able to help more than this but these are my quick observations I have same issue. Local build took about 1 minute avg. this was after node reinstallation (removed all cache and node js files). \r\nBut on docker it took 1000 second to build production package. It doesn't matter if `CI` is present or not. \r\nI have tried multiple docker/node versions always the same result. Also I have tried to change versions of typescript and styled components with no effect or very small effect on build time.   Random thought: are you building in the root of your docker container? I've an idea that's problematic for reasons that escape me. Something was reported in ts-loader (I don't think it was ts-loader specific). Read details here: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/758#issuecomment-379733292 > Random thought: are you building in the root of your docker container?

Read details here: [TypeStrong/ts-loader#758 (comment)](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/758#issuecomment-379733292)\r\n\r\nNope, working in subdirectory. Using this dockerfile. \r\n\r\n```docker\r\nFROM node:11.9.0-stretch\r\nFROM cypress/browsers:chrome67\r\n\r\nRUN mkdir /var/build-folder\r\nRUN npm install -g serve yarn\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /var/build-folder/\r\n\r\nCOPY . .\r\n\r\nRUN yarn\r\n\r\nRUN yarn build\r\n\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"./test.sh\"]\r\n``` running tsc doesn't seem to cause an issue (completes in ~ 1min)\r\nI combined it with the build command hoping to see an improvement.\r\n\r\nI also tried with typescript 3.4.1 and 3.4.5 all with the same issue.\r\n\r\nI found some posts suggesting I eject and use Fork TS Checker Webpack plugin, but I would much rather be stuck with hour long deployments than an ejected CRA.\r\n It looks like when there is `lazy loading` and `circular dependency` it will take a long time in production mode on docker/node. I think this is another issue that I have.\r\nEDIT: On local machine it runs around 1 minute I have tried it on mac, PC, linux(ubuntu). But when running in docker container, time is always ~16 minutes average (1000s). I've resolved the issue however its hard to pinpoint the exact cause; seems there were multiple side effects happening.\r\n\r\n    \"@date-io/core\": \"^1.2.0\",\r\n    \"@date-io/date-fns\": \"^1.3.5\",\r\n    \"@material-ui/core\": \"^1.5.1\",\r\n    \"@material-ui/icons\": \"^2.0.3\",\r\n    \"date-fns\": \"^2.0.0-alpha.27\",\r\n    \"material-ui\": \"^0.20.2\",\r\n    \"material-ui-pickers\": \"1.0.0-rc.14\",\r\n    \"styled-components\": \"^4.2.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"3.5.0-dev.20190512\",\r\n\r\nmaterial-ui/material-ui-pickers is deprecated for @material-ui & @material-ui/pickers however there seems to be a conflict with @material-ui/core and style themes don't render properly when using withStyles(); unfortunately I'm stuck with a project that heavily uses these HOC's.\r\n\r\nI also added a condition to the tsconfig.json to exclude all .js & .jsx files in my project which could have been part of the reason build times were taking an hour.\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\r\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\r\n    \"allowJs\": true,\r\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\r\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\r\n    \"strict\": true,\r\n    \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\": true,\r\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\r\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\r\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\r\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\r\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\r\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\r\n    \"noEmit\": true,\r\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"include\": [\"src\"],\r\n  \"exclude\": [\"src/**/*.js\", \"src/**/*.jsx\"]\r\n}\r\n\r\nThere is still the issue of my CPU ( i7 ) running at 100%, node consumes all available resources; when I close apps node increases it's consumption.\r\n\r\nThere is clearly a leak and I'm wondering if it's package related or a hardware failure.\r\n\r\nMy cloud deployments are down to 3min now :)\r\n Finally resolved the CPU issue but now seems to have slowed down the typechecking, getting the message \"Files successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results...\" in my terminal.\r\n\r\nDocker build times are back up to ~50min\r\n\r\n@types/styled-components is a conflicting package (newer versions break the docker build)\r\ndate-fns has a format issue, using moment to get around this.\r\n\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@date-io/core\": \"^1.2.0\",\r\n    \"@date-io/date-fns\": \"^1.3.5\",\r\n    \"date-fns\": \"^2.0.0-alpha.27\",\r\n    \"material-ui\": \"^0.20.2\",\r\n    \"material-ui-pickers\": \"1.0.0-rc.14\",\r\n    \"moment\": \"^2.24.0\",\r\n    \"styled-components\": \"^4.2.0\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"3.3.4000\",\r\n},\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^12.0.2\",\r\n    \"@types/styled-components\": \"4.0.3\",\r\n}, Re: styled components it sounds like TypeScript 3.5 will improve the situation: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-3-5-rc/ thanks @johnnyreilly I just installed 3.5-rc and it resolved the build times and the typechecking.\r\n\r\nI am still getting 100% CPU usage when connected to AC (HP Elite Book i7) Glad things are improving! I wonder if this issue might help you with the CPU usage problem: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31048\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6792#issuecomment-485149432 I ran into a similar issue on Windows when migrating from CRA `2.1.3` to `3.x`. Although for me it was the opposite: `yarn start` took 10 - 20 minutes instead.\r\nI narrowed down the root cause to `2.1.7 -> 2.1.8` change and specifically this pr #6406\r\nTS version I used was `3.3.1` in all setups.\r\n\r\nWith every top level import like `import * as MUI from '@material-ui/core'` or even `import {Button} from '@material-ui/core'` the build time increased non linearly. Adding a single `@material-ui/icons` import to the mix increased the build time 2x more.\r\n\r\nThis does not happen if I disable async mode for `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`. Tested on both CRA `2.1.8` and `3.x` versions.\r\nThis is the config line I flipped to `false`: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/bdaccf7161af1d78a867d7798759be296ad1b4c5/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L637\r\n\r\nI can confirm that setting `TSC_WATCHFILE=UseFsEventsWithFallbackDynamicPolling` or `TSC_WATCHFILE=UseFsEvents` mitigates the issue. Still, it is not obvious to me why it manifests itself only in async mode in the first place.  `babel-jest` is in the `react-error-overlay` package as well.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

I hope, CRA/Facebook community can find fix and helps you with this bug :) @ianschmitz it works!, Thank you.  Using create-react-app version 3.* with typescript breaks compilation on certain linting rules and even crashes in some cases.\r\nThe reason for that is an incorrect eslint rule configuration which is not compatible with https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint\r\n\r\n## Case 1\r\nUsing an overloaded constructor definition in a typescript class like will throw an exception from eslint:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass Case1 {\r\n    constructor(a: number, b: string);\r\n    constructor(b: string);\r\n    constructor(aOrB: string | number, b?: string) {\r\n        if (typeof aOrB === 'number') {\r\n            console.log('variant 1 called with b = ' + b);\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.log('variant 2 called with b = ' + aOrB);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Result\r\neslint will throw the following exception:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'body' of null\r\nOccurred while linting <my test file>\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThis issue was reported here https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/420\r\nThe solution to this problem is to disable `no-useless-constructor` and enable `@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor`\r\n\r\n## Case 2\r\nUsing an overloaded class method generates invalid warnings from eslint\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```typescript\r\nclass Case2 {\r\n    public test(a: number, b: string): void;\r\n    public test(b: string): void;\r\n    public test(aOrB: string | number, b?: string): void {\r\n        if (typeof aOrB === 'number') {\r\n            console.log('variant 1 called with b = ' + b);\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.log('variant 2 called with b = ' + aOrB);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n```\r\n  Line 3:  Duplicate name 'test'                     no-dupe-class-members\r\n  Line 4:  Duplicate name 'test'                     no-dupe-class-members\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe rule `no-dupe-class-members` should be disabled for typescript linting because typescript compiler already does that: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/291\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nI suspect there might be more cases like these, however these are the ones which have been found until now.\r\n\r\nSee #6871 Is there an estimate when a build with these fixes will be published to npm?\r\nWould be nice to get this out asap. Since 3.0 was a major release and updating to it is something you do intentionally, it seems like this can wait at least until the work week? It's the weekend now. Of course - just wanted to know if releases can take some weeks or if such fixes are published quickly.\r\nSo sometime next week is perfect \ud83d\udc4d   ### Is this a bug report?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nYes - npm version 6.9.0\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\nAll of the below:\r\n```\r\n./node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/utils.js\r\nCritical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression\r\n\r\n./node_modules/jsdom/node_modules/parse5/lib/index.js\r\nCritical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n```\r\nnpx: installed 91 in 4.993s\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS High Sierra 10.13.3\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770HQ CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.3 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: Not Found\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 74.0.3729.131\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n    Safari: 11.0.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n    react-scripts: 3.0.0 => 3.0.0\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nUnfortunately I don't have exact steps. I was running on CRA 2.13 and was hitting this warning. I upgraded to 3.0, figuring that Jest/jsdom would also get updated, removing the error but no dice. I'm not even using Jest - here's my output for `npm ls jsdom`:\r\n```\r\n\u2514\u2500\u252c react-scripts@3.0.0\r\n  \u251c\u2500\u252c jest@24.7.1\r\n  \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u252c jest-cli@24.7.1\r\n  \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u252c jest-config@24.7.1\r\n  \u2502     \u2514\u2500\u252c jest-environment-jsdom@24.7.1\r\n  \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 jsdom@11.12.0\r\n  \u2514\u2500\u252c jest-environment-jsdom-fourteen@0.1.0\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 jsdom@14.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nNo warnings from the console.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nI get the warnings as described from the above.\r\n\r\nNote that I see a related issue here https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2066 but the solution involves editing the webpack config, which I can't do since I haven't ejected.\r\n Sorry - This is directly from my server:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"736\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-04 at 11 46 18 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3485060/57183477-585f4600-6e62-11e9-8c18-61ae2c0c0bcd.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd a grep for `jsdom`:\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-04 at 11 47 11 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3485060/57183487-83499a00-6e62-11e9-9732-e1adcc99e25f.png\">\r\n This is just from `npm start`. I'm not - the above screenshot is grepping jsdom for everything. Is it possible another module is importing it? Working on this soon! Sorry for the delay. I've tracked the warnings coming from `react-sketch`. I'll look into it from there.\r\n\r\nSidenote - Is there a reason the linter looks at imported modules?  Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun a project in dev mode on a port that is already used. It will prompt a different port. Hit \"Y\" to continue.\r\n\r\nCustom .env variables will be missing on this project. Can you please provide more information about what version of react-scripts you're using, what OS, etc.? react-scripts: 3.0.0\r\nMacOS Thanks. We'll check this out and see if we can reproduce it.  While I build my app I get this lint error: \r\n\r\n`Unexpected control character(s) in regular expression: \\x08  no-control-regex`\r\n\r\nI go to https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-control-regex and understand the error, but I dont get why this regex throws that error: `[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._+~#=]{2,256}.[a-z]{2,6}\\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_+.~#?&/=]*)`\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of minutes I find out what was happening, the **\\b** is like \\&bull; character. (&bull;) \r\n\r\nI try to find what the **\\b** means on the regex and get that this metacharacter \r\n\r\n> Is an anchor like the caret and the dollar sign.\r\n\r\nAs i find [here](https://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html)\r\n\r\nThe thing is that the regex I try to use is a pretty common, I just want to get if the text is a URL as  I find on that [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3809401/what-is-a-good-regular-expression-to-match-a-url).\r\n\r\n**Why this is important:**\r\nAs the lint rules on create-react-app isnt removable I believe it shoud be removed of the create-react-app project as it generates conflicts with an actual regex metacharacter.\r\n\r\nEDIT: As I dont deal much with Regex I apologise if this is an expected behavior. Apparently, you're creating your regexp passing the pattern as a string literal to the `RegExp` constructor:\r\n```ts\r\nconst re = RegExp('[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._+~#=]{2,256}.[a-z]{2,6}\\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_+.~#?&/=]*)');\r\n```\r\nHowever, in string literals, `\\b` is an escape sequence with its own meaning. For `\\b` to make it into the regexp, you can either escape the backslash in the string literal:\r\n```ts\r\nconst re = RegExp('[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._+~#=]{2,256}.[a-z]{2,6}\\\\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_+.~#?&/=]*)');\r\n```\r\nor better use a regexp literal:\r\n```ts\r\nconst re = /[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._+~#=]{2,256}.[a-z]{2,6}\\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_+.~#?&/=]*)/;\r\n```\r\n  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here.)\r\nyarn --version\r\n1.15.2\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here if relevant.)\r\nFailed to exec start script\r\nreact-scripts\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\n System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 Antergos Linux\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 11.14.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.15.2 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: 66.0.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-scripts: 3.0.0 => 3.0.0 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1.

I've got the same problem here too i also  I change the version of the \"react-scripts\" from 3.0.0 - to 2.1.8\r\nand its working  I've found another solution more easy.\r\nIn your package.json, just add BROWSER=none before react-scripts start.\r\nTHis will not launch the browser, and you will not have errors\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWSER=none react-scripts start\r\n I think I found the issue.\r\n1)in the file mentioned above by @ianschmitz the _getBrowserEnv_  function is reading the environment variable *BROWSER* and if, like in my case is `/usr/bin/chromium` and there is no such binary in the specified path it doesn't have what to open.\r\n\r\nMy Solution: set your *BROWSER* env variable to the right binary, in my case is\r\n\r\n _/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable_ with  `export BROWSER=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`\r\n\r\nor you can modify the file @ianschmitz  _getBrowserEnv function_ with the binary you desire,\r\nset the _value_ const: `const value = \"/usr/bin/your-binary-here\"`\r\n\r\nI am wondering if this is a _react-create-app_ bug for not cathcing this special case or an _antergros_ error for not setting the env variable at installing _google-chrome-stable_!

Which config object are you talking about? CRA is ignoring config files and only reading from package.json from what I understand @delaaxe That's correct about CRA; it's causing a lot of [grief among new Typescript adopters of CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6871#issuecomment-490233835) who don't read the invisible fine print about \"Typescript support\".  As noted in the title, I was writing about using the react-app rules _outside of CRA_.  Both problems show an unfortunately solipsistic line of thinking about lint in this project, that has origins I can only guess at.  - Add missing hyphen in package name on line 17\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

Always nice to learn something new.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Why ignoring casing on `jsx-no-duplicate-props`?\r\n\r\nWhen using Material-UI, you have components that can have different props with different casing as: `inputProps` and `InputProps`, `input` referring to the rendered DOM element and `Input` relating to the React Component.\r\nIs there a specific reason on why CRA specifically ignores the casing instead of just going with the default which is \"letting the casing be\"? Could we change this rule as it wouldn't be a breaking change (I'm happy to make the PR)?\r\n\r\nIt's right on this line: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L232](url)\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\nFlorian I have also experienced this issue with Material-UI, although I'm more willing to blame their API for having confusable names.\r\n\r\nCase is ignored because for `createElement` calls that correspond to native DOM elements, most props are case insensitive because they're translated to `Element.prototype.setAttribute` calls, which forces lower case on the attribute name. https://jsfiddle.net/6u0scetz/ I think this should be fixed to use ignoreCase: false\r\nHaving the same issue with Material UI and the only solution for now is to use comments to disable this Eslint rule for the files that contain this kind of usage. \r\n\r\nI'll be happy to submit a PR  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nI wanted to repurpose an old iPad running iOS 9 for a simple web app that will always be running. I figured I wanted to give it a try using `create-react-app`.\r\n\r\nI was using `const`, `let` and default values in function arguments causing Safari on iOS 9 to fail parsing of the JS.\r\n\r\nThe only way I could make this work (without making my code ugly) was doing the following:\r\n\r\n- `npm run eject`\r\n- `npm i babel-preset-env`\r\n- Add `\"iOS 9\"` to `browserslist.development` and `browserslist.development` in `package.json`\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this without having to eject? Actually re-using the same `browserslist` as came with `create-react-app` makes it feel like this should work out of the box, but for me it did not seem to.\r\n\r\nI read this ticket #3776 but even though it is seemingly merged, it is not actually doing anything. Oh, but the template said that if the answer was 'no' I didn't have to follow the script.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just tried again and after resetting back to before I ejected, installed the package and set the browserslist, it worked. I think it might have been because my resetting cleared some sort of cache. So issue resolved. Sorry for taking up space.

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHere is the dockerfile I use to boot up this container:\r\n```\r\nFROM node:12.0\r\n\r\nRUN apt-get update -y && \\\r\napt-get install -y vim\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /var/www/html\r\nRUN npm i create-react-app@3.0.0\r\nRUN npx create-react-app welcome\r\nRUN npm i react-app-polyfill\r\nWORKDIR /var/www/html/welcome\r\n\r\nCMD [\"npm\",\"start\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the docker-compose file I'm using:\r\n```\r\nversion: '3'\r\nservices:\r\n  react-testing:\r\n    container_name: practice\r\n    image: practice-react\r\n    build:\r\n      context: ./\r\n      dockerfile: dockerfile\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"5900:3000\"\r\n\r\nnetworks:\r\n  default:\r\n    external:\r\n      name: practice.react\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build your own demo environment to test this for yourself, the steps are as follows:\r\n(this is going to assume you know some docker basics. Otherwise you can install create-react-app normally and test it that way)\r\n\r\n1. docker-compose build\r\n2. docker-compose up -d\r\n3. docker exec -it practice bash\r\n4. cd src\r\n5. vi index.js\r\n6. add the two polyfill lines to the top of index.js\r\n7. save and quit vi\r\n8. go to the webpage on IE11.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n the same issue @ianschmitz Can you give me the exact steps to do this? I tried it once already before I made this bug ticket and it didn't work, want to make sure I'm not doing it wrong.\r\n\r\nWent to package.json and under the development section for Browserslist I tried adding these (not all at the same time, one at a time to try and find one that worked) :\r\n\"ie 11\", \r\n\"ie 9-11\", \r\n\"ie > 9\",\r\n\"last 100 ie version\"\r\n Alright It'll take some time to test this since I have to spin up a docker VM here at home. I'll get back as soon as I find out if it worked. Adding IE to CRA 3.0 in browserlist doesn't work.\r\nThis same with default IE record in browserslist in CRA 2.X @ianschmitz was correct. deleting node_modules worked.\r\nSteps: \r\n1. Add \"ie 11\" to package.json \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14354448/56854096-4da32f00-68ff-11e9-9908-d791cbe5c8aa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. rm -rf node_modules\r\n3. npm install\r\n4. restart the docker container (If not using docker just stop the app and restart it again with npm start.)\r\n\r\nI'll post an updated dockerfile in case anyone is interested in it shortly once I get it working @ianschmitz , adding \"ie 11\" browserslist partially solves the problem, now this error apears on arrow function, previously everything worked with babel-polyfill as temporary resolution this issue I just remove node_modules and replaced package-lock.json and package.json from workin project and `npm i `and all works fine Did you add the polyfills ontop of your index.js file? (or your projects equivalent)\r\n(see my original post) @Crobitaille \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21242063/56854232-e5bf0980-693b-11e9-8fe7-31c3d2fa556b.png)\r\n @604karev \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14354448/56854405-1d11c400-6904-11e9-9684-dfd753d36513.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose first 2 lines in my index.js are *required* for using create-react-app with IE11 now. \r\n```\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs noted here in the release notes for v2.0.5:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases?after=v2.0.5\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14354448/56854299-17b37a00-6902-11e9-947a-a23baf560f32.png)\r\n\r\n This is the docker solution that worked for me. To anyone else who wants to try this solution there are a couple of caveats. \r\n1. If your react-project is not called \"Welcome\" you're going to have to modify the dockerfile to reflect that. \r\n2. You should modify your own package.json and index.js from your existing project, and not use mine. Just be sure to add your \"ie 11\" lines in the project.json and the two polyfills at the top of index.js\r\n3. If you don't have an existing project, then you can use this to get you started. It gives you a project working that can be developed in IE11.\r\n4. Know enough about docker before you start using this. It's an example, not an ideal or even good development environment. If you dont know what docker volumes are or how to use them, this really isnt for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDockerfile:\r\n```\r\nFROM node:12.0\r\n\r\nRUN apt-get update -y && \\\r\napt-get install -y vim\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /var/www/html\r\nRUN npm i create-react-app@3.0.0\r\nRUN npx create-react-app welcome\r\nRUN npm i react-app-polyfill\r\nWORKDIR /var/www/html/welcome\r\n\r\nCOPY ./package.json /var/www/html/welcome/package.json\r\nCOPY ./index.js /var/www/html/src/welcome/index.js\r\n\r\nRUN rm -rf node_modules\r\nRUN npm install\r\n\r\nCMD [\"npm\",\"start\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocker-compose:\r\n```\r\nversion: '3'\r\nservices:\r\n  react-testing:\r\n    container_name: practice\r\n    image: practice-react\r\n    build:\r\n      context: ./\r\n      dockerfile: dockerfile\r\n    ports:\r\n      - \"5900:3000\"\r\n\r\nnetworks:\r\n  default:\r\n    external:\r\n      name: practice.react\r\n```\r\n\r\nindex.js\r\n```\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport './index.css';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\nimport * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\r\n\r\n// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change\r\n// unregister() to register() below.

Setup the create-react-app project as normal.\r\n2. Edit the index.js file and add the following lines at the *VERY TOP* of the file.\r\n```\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';\r\nimport 'react-app-polyfill/stable';\r\n```\r\n3. Edit the Package.json file and add \"ie 11\" to both the production and development sections of the browserslist\r\n```\r\n  \"browserslist\": {\r\n    \"production\": [\r\n      \">0.2%\",\r\n      \"not dead\",\r\n      \"not op_mini all\",\r\n      \"ie 11\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"development\": [\r\n      \"last 1 chrome version\",\r\n      \"last 1 firefox version\",\r\n      \"last 1 safari version\",\r\n      \"ie 11\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n4. delete your entire node_modules folder\r\n5. run `npm install` to re-install the node_modules\r\n  I have following code in index.html:\r\n\r\n`<button onclick=\"func_remove()\">Remove</button>`\r\n\r\nThe function definition is in index.js:\r\n\r\n`function func_remove() { ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(document.getElementById('react_container')) }`\r\n\r\nClicking the button will result in **ReferenceError: func_remove is not defined**.\r\n\r\nHow to make index.js functions visible in index.html?\r\n\r\nI would like to experiment with ReactDOM methods via event handler functions in index.html.\r\n\r\nThis question of mine is slightly related to #6827 Can you post the code of your index.js?\r\n\r\nI'm not clear how you're binding your function to your HTML. Is this actually JSX turning into HTML? It doesn't sound like it, in which case you may want to take a look at the React docs for a better understanding of how React works.\r\n\r\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html\r\n\r\nIn your case, if you're using the default index.js supplied with CRA, your app is rendering from JS; your functions are not directly accessible from the HTML DOM, but you can make them so. It would probably be easier to render this button using React and the `onClick` attribute in JSX. My index.js is just the bare CRA index.js with the added function definition.\r\n\r\nMy point is not about ReactDOM nor how it is supposed to be used.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I can't get functions defined in index.js visible/usable in index.html.\r\n\r\nUsually it is quite easy to include a Javascript file in an HTML file:\r\n`<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"index.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\nI do realise that CRA has a complex build toolchain, so the old school script inclusion demonstrated above does not work.\r\n Right, CRA won\u2019t tie your index.js directly to the index.html using a script tag.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll need to either write a React component with the button and tie the function to the `onClick` attribute on that component\u2019s button, while using a component method for the function you desire or create a separate JS file that is in the same level folder hierarchy as your index.html and load *that* with a script tag.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re doing it the second way, though, you are really missing the whole benefit of CRA and especially webpack.\r\n\r\nYou could also bundle it separately using webpack, in theory, but why?\r\n\r\nCan I ask what the goal is by circumventing CRA and webpack?\r\n\r\nYou could also add the React script to the index.html (like in the link I posted above) but that is assuming you\u2019re loading the HTML file directly, not serving via CRA/node.\r\n\r\nIn that case you could also load a script via script tag of your own code and use React directly in the DOM.\r\n\r\nTechnically you could still use CRA to serve the page, but all of your JS being loaded via script tags would really exist \u201coutside\u201d the app. When you perform your build, it would still work, but you\u2019d need to provide your JS from script tags via static files; they won\u2019t be bundled by webpack by default.\r\n\r\nEDIT - nvm corrected myself where I was actually right; webpack is included I think it's just obscured by the `react-scripts` or something; it's not an explicit dependency listing in package.json so I was confused ;). I'm just wondering whether CRA build process could be altered so that index.js functions would be visible in index.html. No need to circumvent CRA and webpack, if this little feature could just be added to the build system.\r\n\r\nRight now I can't trigger ReactDom methods dynamically from the top level (index.html).\r\n\r\nConsider this use case:\r\n\r\nIndex.html does not have any React components by default. I want to initiate the addition of the first React component dynamically by utilising onClick event handler function from index.html.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to do that with CRA.  Hi.\r\n\r\nI was using eslint with my own configuration file(.eslintrc.js) in CRA v2:\r\n```module.exports = {\r\n  parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',\r\n  extends: [\r\n    'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',\r\n    'react-app',\r\n    'plugin:prettier/recommended',\r\n    'prettier',\r\n    'airbnb',\r\n  ],\r\n  plugins: ['@typescript-eslint', 'react'],\r\n  rules: {\r\n    '@typescript-eslint/indent': ['error', 2],\r\n    '@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type': 0,\r\n    'no-unused-vars': 0,\r\n    '@typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface': 0,\r\n    'prettier/prettier': 0,\r\n    '@typescript-eslint/no-parameter-properties': 0,\r\n\"ignoreRestSiblings\": false }],\r\n    'react/prop-types': 0,\r\n    'react/jsx-filename-extension': [\r\n      1,\r\n      { extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', 'tsx', 'ts'] },\r\n    ],\r\n    'import/prefer-default-export': 0,\r\n    'no-param-reassign': 0,\r\n    'no-empty-function': 0,\r\n    'no-useless-constructor': 0,\r\n    'import/no-unresolved': 0,\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\nBut CRA v3 was released, and it contains typescript linting support.\r\nCan I keep using this with CRA v3?\r\nI'm worried about they will conflict.  ### Request\r\nAdd `react` as a cli alias with `create-react-app`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nreact my-app\r\n```\r\n\r\n`react` command can bring more native feel to the environment But I don't think https://github.com/facebook/react itself has a cli and `create-react-app` is treated as an official one :thinking: :confused:  I agree with @ianschmitz; React is just a library, so having a cli doesn\u2019t make sense. CRA is one way to create a project that _uses_ React, but there are many others.    <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

I am now using `react-scripts` version 3.0.1 successfully.  `react-scripts` v3.0.0\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHey!\r\n\r\nWe're using the new ESLint-linting for TypeScript. Works great so far, but a TS feature makes a lint obsolete:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst fn = (input: 'foo' | 'bar'): string => {\r\n  switch (input) {\r\n    case 'foo':\r\n      return 'a';\r\n    case 'bar':\r\n      return 'b';\r\n    // `input` can't have any other value than `foo` or `bar`\r\n    // (so this switch is guaranteed to be exhausive), yet ESLint\r\n    // complains with `default-case`\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the switch is safe because TS guarantees exhausiveness, yet ESLint complains about a missing `default`-case. However, in this case it's actually detrimental to add a default case, because you're actively using the compiler's exhaustiveness-analysis for correctness. And you won't be warned anymore when extending the range of valid parameter values and forgetting the appropriate switch case.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see it, there are three options:\r\n\r\n1. Disable the lint for TS projects\r\n2. Hook into `tsc` to validate the switch's exhausiveness and conditionally apply the lint\r\n3. Do nothing and leave the lint as is\r\n\r\nI consider options 1 and 2 to be valid, and I'd prefer not to go with 3, because it removes some of TS type system's power. Is number 2 not viable?  I'm not very familiar with the linter's internals.  Typescript does compute the needed information (in the hypothetical missing `default` case, the type of the switch expression would be `never` if the case is not needed), so that would be the safest option.   This is not a bug report.\r\n\r\nRight now, NODE_ENV, and more importantly the associated .env files (https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) is hardcoded to be development for `npm run start`, and production for `npm run build`. This prevents to have for example a 'staging' environment. Moreover, I cannot use `npm run start` with the production settings or (more problematic) `npm run build` with the development settings.\r\n\r\nUse-case : let\u2019s say that the frontend I build must be built for three environments (local development/internal shared staging/production). The frontend uses a different backend for each environment (let\u2019s say http://localhost/backend/, https://staging.example.com/ and https://example.com/).\r\n\r\nThe \"natural\" way of implementing this setup would have a .env.staging, .env.development and .env.production env files containing a variable pointing to the right backing. This is not currently possible, since all `NODE_ENV=staging npm run build` will use the production settings, and `NODE_ENV=staging npm run start` will use the development settings.\r\n\r\nSuggestion : environments files should be loaded before NODE_ENV is forcefully set to production/development, or NODE_ENV should not be overridden at all if explicitly set by the user.  This is covered in the docs: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#customizing-environment-variables-for-arbitrary-build-environments  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\nI am using inside hooks the useEffect for componentDidMount. Additionally I have a useContext.\r\nI am calling a function via the context for changing a state with a given param.\r\nAlthough this works fine, I get a warning inside the console which looks like following:\r\n\r\n`React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'langContext'.

Bonus points for screenshots!\r\n\r\nHappy contributing!\r\n-->\r\n  I recently upgraded to create-react-app 2.1.8 and noticed the hashes used  in css modules classnames are different in different build environments.  I did some debugging and saw that 'react-dev-utils/getCSSModuleLocalIdent' uses 'context.resourcePath + localName' for the hash generation and that context.resourcePath was an absolute path.  The original discussion (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/3965) indicated we wanted the full path for uniqueness and that we also wanted to preserve keep the classnames deterministic for automated testing.  It seems like trimming the context.resourcePath of context.rootContext would preserve uniqueness within the project and allow users to write tests against the classnames locally and have it work on different machines regardless of the project path.  \r\n\r\nExample of the issue, the classnames for css modules in the below two repo locations will hash to different values in the current code:\r\n/Users/person1/projectrepo/\r\n/Users/person2/projectrepo/\r\n\r\nIf in getCSSModuleLocalIdent we change the code to something like the below, the hashes will be the same\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst hash = loaderUtils.getHashDigest(\r\n    context.resourcePath.replace(context.rootContext, \"\") + localName\r\n    'md5',\r\n    'base64',\r\n    5\r\n  );\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit a PR if this makes sense and I didn't miss something obvious.  Thank you! Thanks @ianschmitz, the PR has been submitted: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6876 While not exactly the same issue, I\u2019ve seen a report that our CSS sourcemaps include absolute paths.

I was having the same problem. Removed `yarn.lock` and `node_modules/` and did a fresh `yarn install`. This solved for me. Might give it a try. That's exactly what I just did and it works ! But... I think it's not the good solution, but I may be wrong \ud83d\ude05.\r\n\r\nGood luck for your problem !  oooh never thought about it. I mean I always remove the `node_modules/` and the `package-lock.json` just in case, but didn't remove the `yarn.lock`. I did a rollback of everything to be able to work. I'll try later with that solutions guys; even if it is not the best solution but it might work like did for you. Thanks! :) Also encountering this problem. In one project I have `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` works (doesn't use `package-lock.json`) yet in another project that _does_ use `package-lock.json` doing `rm package-lock.json && rm -rf node_modules && npm install` does _not_ fix this issue. It's complaining about any places where I have dynamic imports (i.e. `import()`). We have hit this issue as well and it seemed to be related to a change in ```acorn-dynamic-import``` package. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25738591/56635966-3cd48e00-665f-11e9-93bc-af344f1d1612.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25738591/56636464-c042af00-6660-11e9-88fd-53ee4cf58541.png)\r\n\r\nWe had to manually change our ```package-lock.json``` to get a build. Deleting the lock file didn't work for us either.\r\nCould be linked to this webpack issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8656\r\nAnd maybe this one: https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/issues/809 @andybarsby looks like you found the issue! Changing the `package-lock` wasn't really an option in the failing project, so I installed `acorn-dynamic-import@3` to `devDependencies` and ran a build and it worked. So \ud83e\udd1ethis works when it heads up to the CI. Thanks for the tip. I couldn't compile and start the app after I upgraded **react-scripts** to v3.0.1.\r\nI've removed node_modules and installing them again and this have solved the problem for me. Thanks @kylehalleman and @andybarsby , this is the only solution that have worked for me! I've been having this issue since the 3.0 alpha/beta. I will try to suggest this as a fix in #6673   The introduction of #6513 stops my application from compiling as it uses it's own Typescript linting rules instead of the rules I have in .eslintrc.js\r\n\r\nPrevious to CRA adding Typescript linting I created my own typescript lint config for eslint using `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` along with airbnb and prettier rules.\r\n\r\nWithin the project there is typescript file generated by `graphql-code-generator` that breaks various linting rules, so  has been added to a `.eslintignore` file. When I run eslint the project passes with no errors.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I build the project or run it in dev mode 2 lint errors are raised, relating to the fact that import statements appear half way through the file. Using the .eslintignore file doesn't fix this problem, nor does updating my .eslintrc.js file to exclude the rule.\r\n\r\nAs a result I cannot build my project with CRA 3 and have had to revert to 2. I had the same issue but I found a solution: https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/add\r\n\r\nIn your `codegen.yml`, use the plugin `add` to insert an `/* eslint-disable */` line to the start of the file.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nschema: http://localhost:5000/api/graphql\r\noverwrite: true\r\ngenerates:\r\n    ./src/generated.tsx:\r\n        documents: ./src/graphql/*.ts\r\n        plugins:\r\n            - add: \"/* eslint-disable */\"\r\n            - typescript-common\r\n            - typescript-client\r\n            - typescript-react-apollo\r\n        config:\r\n            noNamespaces: true\r\n            enumsAsTypes: true\r\n            withHooks: true\r\n            noHoc: false\r\n            noComponents: false\r\n``` I'm having the same issue: tslint.json rules seem to be ignored now in v3 and overwritten by the new defaults. Please send help. We've also upgraded to the latest react-scripts (3.0.0) in order to get rid of high vulnerabilities, but it broke our tslint configuration. No `.eslinttignore` or `.eslintrc` are working and adding comments to every file that disables eslint seems really bad.  Ok, but why can't I configure my own rules? To comply with your rules, I would have to rewrite my code. Stupid breaking change... I also came back to revert to 2. @ianschmitz I think the confusion was that Typescript folks where using TSLint since the react-scripts had no TS linting support. We have entire projects built using custom rules, but now since TS linting is supported in v3, we are all stuck with pages of warnings and/or broken builds. While the JS community had somewhat the ease of greenfield development using react-scripts' blessed linting rules, the TS community is now coming onboard with custom opinionated rulesets for large existing projects.\r\n\r\nProposals:\r\n1. provide a way to completely disable linting in production and live server (maybe this already exists?)\r\n2. provide a way for custom eslint overriding rules (both JS/TS)\r\n\r\nOn a community aside, I didn't realize the react-scripts didn't allow JS projects to customize the linting rules. As someone that disagrees with the defaults of most linters (as well as my team), it feels very heavy-handed to including linting by-default without a way to customize. (obviously there's ejection, but it's far from an easy path to own) I purposely use eslint as the Typescript team stated that that is their preferred solution and are putting effort into eslint support, though I'm sure some folks here use tslint.\r\n\r\nBut back to the comment by @ianschmitz . I understand that the linting config, which now supports Typescript, is it's own thing and doesn't use the lint config a developer may add but my issue is that this recent change broken my code, and it seems others too. I know moving to 3 means possible breaking changes but this wasn't in the release notes, probably because no one realised.\r\n\r\nThe workaround @wilcoschoneveld mentioned will get me out of this for now but as @jadbox says, linting is opinionated and projects have rules in place and probably went through their own pain getting them agreed. I too think that having CRA linting errors stop a build is too heavy handed. I worry that option 2 would be too difficult to do and maybe the quickest short term solution would be to add a config option to allow a build to complete even when there are lint errors and maybe another to allow linting to be disabled so the user can use their own. @ianschmitz is this just a matter of looking to see if a user has provided an `.eslintrc` file here? if they have one, CRA could load it, otherwise use the existing one as a default?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L324\r\n This is *very* frustrating.\r\nThe fix seemingly solves very few, if any, actual problems people report,  while going pretty much against what is purports to fix, i.e. #5641, which very clearly shows interest for a configurable tslint. In addition it enforces rules that are *NOT* in the list of \"things that we want\", such as unknown-ref,\r\nin a few examples that I looked, it seems to ignore things defined via definitely typed @types that have something like\r\ndeclare global {\r\n  x: Type;\r\n}\r\nx is being reported as unkonwn.  @dmitryxcom Just to be clear, by \"the fix\", are you referring to 3.0, or to some subsequent PR? @estaub I mean #6513 TSLint is getting deprecated, as its own homepage says:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"938\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-27 at 01 46 08\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/56842565-45f77200-688e-11e9-95ce-a220e7be4f9b.png\">\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what longer term strategy you're suggesting if even TypeScript itself is officially recommending a move to ESLint (which we have done). Create React App 3.0 aligns the linting rule with the same rules that have always been enabled in the JavaScript version.\r\n\r\nIf there are specific rules that are causing you trouble, I'd appreciate a more detailed writeup about specifics. There is no need to make this issue emotional. We're all people and are trying to do what's good for the project and most users. I'm sorry upgrading created issues for your existing setups \u2014 but eventually you'd have to make those changes anyway, as TSLint will be deprecated by its maintainers.\r\n > As someone that disagrees with the defaults of most linters (as well as my team), it feels very heavy-handed to including linting by-default without a way to customize. (obviously there's ejection, but it's far from an easy path to own)\r\n\r\nI'd like to emphasize Create React App ships with a very relaxed rule set that only includes the bare minimum of things that protect against real bugs. We don't ship any stylistic rules or rules that are largely a matter of opinion. (The only exception is the React Hooks rules which we intend to enforce more strongly.)\r\n\r\n>We have entire projects built using custom rules, but now since TS linting is supported in v3, we are all stuck with pages of warnings and/or broken builds\r\n\r\nCan you give me an example of which rules you're bumping into? > TSLint has been deprecated, and will not be maintained in the future. Please read the announcement from the TypeScript team regarding that.\r\n\r\nand similar. While the deprecation is *on the roadmap* the current state of eslint does not allow it to be a drop-in solution since it misses the most important type-based TS checks tslint provides (and for the majority of other checks there's prettier). Making it the default in CRA is a bit too early a call, in my opinion, and that is what is frustrating about the decision to make it default in CRA3, which goes beyond being opinionated, and becomes pushy and limiting.\r\n\r\nThe deprecation notice clearly warns about eslint not being ready as a replacement:\r\n\r\n> This will not be an immediate deprecation; on the contrary, there is a lot of work to do to ensure a smooth transition to the new tooling without any regressions. There are features, test suites, and conveniences in TSLint which we hope to retain in the migration. There may be a period of time when there is overlap between the two tools and TSLint early adopters are recommended to run both linters to ensure full code check coverage (to a reasonable degree such that performance doesn't suffer drastically).\r\n-- source: https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534\r\n\r\n> but eventually you'd have to make those changes anyway, as TSLint will be deprecated by its maintainers.\r\n> I'm not sure what longer term strategy you're suggesting if even TypeScript itself is officially recommending a move to ESLint (which we have done\r\n\r\nMy strategy is to wait until esint is fully compatible, which I argue should be CRA strategy as well, or at  least, CRA should provide an opt-out of ts eslint linting until that point is reached. Like you point out, the migration will happen *eventually*, but the time is not here yet.\r\n\r\n> If there are specific rules that are causing you trouble, I'd appreciate a more detailed writeup about specifics.\r\n> Can you give me an example of which rules you're bumping into?\r\n\r\nI've opted out of CRA3 for now with a todo to file specific bugs if I find the time to do that work.  I think it would be very reasonable to expect at least an opt-out until https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534 and https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/36 are closed Do I understand correctly that with #6915 there's currently no way to configure eslint? In which case, it  can not be considered a tslint replacement at this point? @ianschmitz Thanks for your reply and your patience. In my case I can get around it for now. I feel for the people who can't and I think an opt out would help them and be a quick win.\r\n\r\nI also agree that a measured approach to addressing this and providing further flexibility is the right thing to do, rather than rush into a solution that makes things worse with regards to picking up a users config. I would imagine more than a handful of organisations have CRA-based projects with `tslint.json` file referring to their own common ruleset as `\"extends\": [\"@company/tslint-config-company\"]`.\r\n\r\nCRA 3 breaks any such project by enforcing a different set of rules and it's a shame to eject because of it.\r\n\r\nWhile moving towards ESLint and providing some reasonable defaults for linting are both very reasonable goals, I think the existence of local tslint or eslint configuration files should definitely override this.\r\n\r\nIt's likely most developers aren't even aware of TSLint's future deprecation plans yet, so this is likely a very unpleasant surprise while updating projects dependencies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a more reasonable migration path would be to display a deprecation warning about TSLint configuration, so users can start migrating their rules. @ianschmitz in my case, the linting is not necessarily breaking, but confusing in a few ways:\r\n\r\n1. VSCode picks up my local `.eslintrc.js` file, so VSCode provides linting warnings and autofixes from that file. My linting tasks from `package.json` also use my local `.eslintrc.js` file. CRA, however, uses its own config and reports separate warnings in the terminal and browser console. It's confusing for my project to have two essentially two different linting rule sets, and there are certain rules that come with CRA that I just don't want (see below), or aren't included in the default config.\r\n\r\n2. When creating a production build, my builds fail since `process.env.CI = true` and warnings are treated as errors. I'm aware I can disable this.\r\n\r\n@gaearon rules I'm bumping into:\r\n\r\n`no-unused-vars` - I have unused vars all the time when I comment out code during development, so while I like the idea of this rule, I generally find it a hindrance while developing and turn it off. What I used to do with TSLint was occasionally turn the rule on, run my linter to clean up unused code, and then turn it back off.\r\n\r\n`array-callback-return` - I'm getting this from an arrow function that does a switch case on a known TypeScript string, so I have no default return value.\r\n`default-case` - Same as above. Example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n          titles.sort((titleA, titleB) => {\r\n            switch (titleSortBy) {\r\n              case 'name': {\r\n                return getAlphabeticalSortValue(titleA.name, titleB.name);\r\n              }\r\n              case 'type': {\r\n                return getAlphabeticalSortValue(titleA.type, titleB.type)\r\n              }\r\n              case 'launchDate': {\r\n                return getNumericSortValue(titleA.launchDate, titleB.launchDate);\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like @ianschmitz [already addressed this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6937), though I'm not sure that PR also covers `array-callback-return` ?\r\n\r\n`exhaustive-deps` - I'm new to hooks here so maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it seems like you shouldn't need to pass in certain types of functions, like `dispatch` or action creators like `fetchTitle`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  // only run this effect when props.movieId changes\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    props.dispatch(fetchTitle(props.movieId));\r\n  }, [props.movieId]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[The example here makes sense](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-it-safe-to-omit-functions-from-the-list-of-dependencies) since `doSomething` is closure containing `someProp`, but in this case I'm not sure the linting rule makes sense?\r\n\r\nEven if I adopted all the rules above, there are additional rules I like that aren't in the CRA configuration, such as` import/order` \u2013\u2013\u00a0it looks like the default CRA config has no opinion about import ordering, for instance.\r\n\r\n@ianschmitz I understand there may be a compelling philosophical reason to not allow linting customization in CRA, but is there a compelling code complexity reason? It seems like loading a user's custom `.estlinrc` file would be relatively straightforward (per my comment above), but I'm not nearly familiar enough with the codebase to make that judgment. Would it have consequences on other parts of the CRA build pipeline? facing a similar issue, excluded node_modules but it is still linting **src** folder in one of the npm packages. There also are code breaking rules in the current configuration!\r\nUsing an overloaded constructor definition in a typescript class like this will throw an exception from eslint:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass Test {\r\n    constructor(a: number, b: string);\r\n    constructor(b: string);\r\n    constructor(aOrB: string | number, b: string) {\r\n      if (typeof aOrB === 'number') ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code will break with this error:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'body' of null\r\nOccurred while linting <my test file>\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported here https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/420 and the only correct solution is to disable `no-useless-constructor` and enable `@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor` instead which I can't do.\r\nIt really should be possible to disable / customize linting rules.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\nSame seems to happen for overloaded functions in general.\r\nI tried to define a static `Create` function with my needed overloads instead, however this also throws a linting warning (but at least it does not crash).\r\nThe rule `no-dupe-class-members` should be disabled for typescript linting because typescript compiler already does that: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/291\r\n```\r\n  Line 52:  Duplicate name 'Create'                     no-dupe-class-members\r\n  Line 53:  Duplicate name 'Create'                     no-dupe-class-members\r\n  Line 54:  Duplicate name 'Create'                     no-dupe-class-members\r\n``` Well to me it does not sound like a separate issue - the title says the new linting causes build failures and that's exactly what I described as well (though I found cases that are not even fixable)\r\nIf you still think this should be a separate issue (because of the severity of the overload issue), we could create a separate issue to get this sorted out quickly while taking time to properly think about handling user linting rule customizations. Ok I found a workaround for this issue: Use `react-app-rewired` with `customize-cra` (https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra) and something like the following config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// config-overrides.js\r\nconst {\r\n    override,\r\n    useEslintRc,\r\n} = require('customize-cra');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = override(\r\n    useEslintRc(),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use something like this as `.eslintrc.js`\r\n```js\r\n// .eslintrc.js\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nconst baseConfig = require('eslint-config-react-app');\r\nconst baseOverrides = Array.isArray(baseConfig.overrides) ? baseConfig.overrides : [baseConfig.overrides];\r\nconst baseTsOverride = baseOverrides.find(x => x.files.find(f => f.indexOf('*.ts') > 0));\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    ...baseConfig,\r\n    overrides: [\r\n        {\r\n            ...baseTsOverride,\r\n            rules: {\r\n                ...baseTsOverride.rules,\r\n\r\n                // Remove with next npm release of eslint-config-react-app:\r\n                'default-case': 'off',\r\n                'no-useless-constructor': 'off',\r\n                '@typescript-eslint/no-useless-constructor': 'warn',\r\n                'no-dupe-class-members': 'off',\r\n\r\n                // << add your own custom rules here >>\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    rules: {\r\n        ...baseConfig.rules,\r\n        // << add your own custom rules here >>\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm glad I was already using react-app-rewired so this was actually quite easy to add \\o/\r\nBut it would be really nice if you could just define custom rules for those 2 sections directly through create-react-app instead of doing some hacky stuff like this.\r\nIt would be so easy to allow users to define something like `customEslintRules` and `customEslintTsRules` which could be merged into those places It seems like I'm having the same issue with CRA 3 & Storybook 5...\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react';\r\nconst stories = storiesOf('button', module);\r\n\r\nstories.add('button', () => <button>click me</button>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill throw\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING in Button/Button.stories.tsx\r\nModule Error (from ./node_modules/eslint-loader/index.js):\r\n\r\nLine 6:3:  Import in body of module; reorder to top  import/first\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge I'm not violating any rules?\r\n\r\nI upgraded from CRA 2 with tslint to CRA 3 with default eslint\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// .eslintrc\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": [\"react-app\"]\r\n}\r\n``` @samueldepooter  A quick google reveals that you are violating [import/first](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/HEAD/docs/rules/first.md).

I also know the rule is enabled but I can't seem to properly overwrite it unless you use a tool like `react-app-rewired` which I'm trying to avoid Experiencing the same issue as @samueldepooter does. It used to work before, but now stopped.  Can't configure storybook 5 with cra 3 with TS... @samueldepooter The error says it's on line 6, but you only showed 5 lines.  What's on line 6?  Or is that the entire contents of the file?\r\n\r\nIf it's the entire file, I wonder if storybook (or something else) appends some code to stories.\r\n\r\nI'm using storybook 5.0.3 with cra 3.0.0, with Typescript, and not seeing this and can't repro from your source.  But I have a lot of config, and upgraded the project from cra 2, both of which muddy the water. @estaub sadly it is the entire contents... I found an older cra issue that is comparable to what you're saying: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2772\r\n\r\nFYI my app runs fine, it's only in storybook. And the error also doesn't output in the story file itself unless I force it by actually violating the rule. So it must be something after compilation...\r\n\r\nEDIT: I finally figured it out. My storybook setup had an addon plugged into webpack which had an `enforce: 'pre'`. It adds extra code on compilation which made ESLint fail on the rule `import/first` @samueldepooter: I'd file another issue along the lines of \"eslint lints compilation output instead of the source code\".\r\n\r\nSeems like it's a general eslint / integration problem: it lints compilation artifacts in various runtimes instead of checking the source code.\r\n\r\nNot pretending to know how others use lint, for me it's a tool to enforce a set of rules about how the source should be written and structured (which I call a style guide), that the-project (whatever the entity it represents) came up with. The coming-up-with seems to be a very important point, since if the set of rules is fixed, some kind of bare-minimum-to-prevent-bugs, it no longer serves the goal of enforcing the style guide, instead serving somebody else's goal of not allowing me to make mistakes.\r\n\r\nI find such enforcing useful as a pre-commit / pre-build check, not as a continuous runtime thing. In a continuous dev environment I, for example, don't care that a variable I just declared is \"never used\" or that a certain method I just added is not in the right position. Besides, the instant notification can be obtained by number of other means, such as analysis provided by the editor of choice and its plugins, when/if wanted (with a very fine control of what and when it is wanted).\r\n\r\nSo like the author of this issue summarized above, there seem to be a misunderstanding going on about the value of lint between CRA maintainers and its users, where the maintainer seek to protect users from bugs, and the users want to be able to lint their code.\r\n\r\nSo the outcome of this is:\r\n-  the existing users of tslint are puzzled by the unnecessary step they see little to no value in that CRA3 added\r\n- the existing users of tslint who are ready to move to eslint can not do so, because (even if eslint and tslint were 100% compatible right now) they are unable to configure eslint within cra3\r\n- the existing users of eslint are puzzled by the fact that their linting is being taken away\r\n- users that were not using any kind of linting are puzzled by the fact that the cra3 linting causes build failures, being plugged into everything automatically instead of being made available as a separate opt-into step\r\n\r\ncra3 effectively takes linting away from projects who lint, replacing it with a safety feature.\r\n\r\nopt-out exists on the file level only, that is via `/* eslint-disable */`.\r\n\r\nthat is my current understanding of the problem @ianschmitz I know there's a lot of noise, but if you have a moment, I tried to address your questions and Dan's above in https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6871#issuecomment-487682863.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned in a followup comment that you are considering the override functionality -- is this something that's being tracked in an issue or RFC or is it still in a conceptual phase? @dannycochran \r\nFrom the POV of an eslint and typescript guy...\r\n\r\n> no-unused-vars - I have unused vars all the time when I comment out code during development, so while I like the idea of this rule, I generally find it a hindrance while developing and turn it off. What I used to do with TSLint was occasionally turn the rule on, run my linter to clean up unused code, and then turn it back off.\r\n\r\nWe know this rule doesn't provide 100% correct results. We're working on this, but it's difficult as right now our only course of action is to rewrite typescript's scope analysis tooling. We're working with the typescript team on this front and hoping we'll be able to leverage their internal APIs in the future.\r\n\r\n@ianschmitz - I doubt it's possible, but would recommend that this rule isn't ever set to `error` for this reason...\r\nIf you can, it's better to instead use `--noUnusedLocals` / `--noUnusedParameters` for production builds. Though looking at the CRA codebase, you use babel for TS transpilation, so that won't work.\r\n\r\n> default-case / array-callback-return - I'm getting this from an arrow function that does a switch case on a known TypeScript string, so I have no default return value.\r\n\r\nthe solution to these problems is pretty simple:\r\n```ts\r\ndefault:\r\n  throw new Error('Unexpected input');\r\n```\r\n[repl](https://eslint.org/demo/#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)\r\nWhilst typescript ensures that code _you_ write is safe, and only provides valid string values, it doesn't mean that everything will do that. This is a pretty good way to explicitly handle that case (making debugging easier).\r\n\r\nA good example of why you might want to do this is that you don't always have 100% control over the data (i.e. could come from an API). If something goes wrong and invalidates the compile time types, then your app could break with a cryptic undefined error.. This way you can have an explicit error and stack if something goes wrong.\r\n\r\n> exhaustive-deps - I'm new to hooks here so maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it seems like you shouldn't need to pass in certain types of functions, like dispatch or action creators like fetchTitle\r\n\r\nYou have to pass in everything that could potentially mutate (meaning your hook needs to be rerun).\r\n\r\nThe rule cannot do control-flow analysis to check if a provided value will change, and instead relies on some smarts to omit certain things (like setters from a `useState` hook).\r\nEven with typescript/flow types, it's not entirely possible to know if a value will remain constant between renders.\r\n\r\nIf you know for certain that some things don't mutate, then you can consider disabling the rule for that line.\r\nHowever there's no real reason to *not* to pass the constant references in, considering the hooks with dependency checks (IIRC) only do a shallow `===` comparison on the values.\r\nIf your app relies on that minute of a perf optimisation, then you're in a very awesome (or absolutely terrible) place with your app's perf. >the solution to these problems is pretty simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefault:\r\n  throw new Error('Unexpected input');\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nJust to play devil's advocate, I've come across the pattern where people intentionally omit a default case if they're switching over a statically defined enum so that if anyone adds an entry to the enum, they'll be forced to handle it in the switch statement at compile time.  Taking us way off topic here (sorry everyone :), buuuuut...\r\n\r\n> they'll be forced to handle it in the switch statement at compile time.\r\n\r\nThat only occurs if you strictly type the function return and/or use `noImplicitReturns`.\r\n\r\nThis can then be handled by instead using the following helper, which will trigger a type error if someone forgets to add a case to the switch because TS won't do an implicit never cast:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction assertIsNever(value: never) {\r\n  return new Error(`Unexpected value ${JSON.stringify(value)}`);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\ndefault:\r\n  // Argument of type '\"b\"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.\r\n  throw assertIsNever(value);\r\n```\r\n[playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#src=type%20str%20%3D%20'a'%20%7C%20'b'%3B%0A%0Afunction%20assertIsNever(value%3A%20never)%20%7B%0A%20%20return%20new%20Error(%60Unexpected%20value%3A%20%24%7BJSON.stringify(value)%7D%60)%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Afunction%20f(arg%3A%20str)%20%7B%0A%20%20switch%20(arg)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20case%20'a'%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20true%3B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20case%20'b'%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%2F%2F%20%20%20return%20false%3B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20default%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20throw%20assertIsNever(arg)%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A) @ianschmitz - sorry, I meant that our rule (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`) isn't 100% correct. Typescript has some very complicated scope logic, so there are a number of false positives.\r\n\r\nWhat I was meaning is that our no-unused-vars is great for development because it can be non-build-blocking, but it's not great as a production build blocker because of the false positives.\r\n\r\nThe best experience is to use our no-unused-vars in dev only, and `noUnusedLocals` for the prod build only.  Found documentation to be incorrect for guiding developers on how to analyze the source map. It states that the path must be wrapped in a quotes which causes no files to be created\r\nBug #6715\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

This is a bug report. To reproduce it, run `npx create-react-app . --typescript` and change the `\"jsx\": \"preserve\"` line to `\"jsx\": \"preserve\",`. This is with CRA3 and I don't think this happened in CRA2 because I kept my `tsconfig.json` the same while upgrading CRA from 2 to 3 and only now got the error. I think this is a CRA issue because running `tsc -p .` in the directory goes through with no problem. TypeScript also allows you to put comments in `tsconfig.json` which makes it not actually JSON. As far as I know they strip them before parsing the file so it's possible they are doing something similar with trailing commas. I think as long as a JSONC parser is used it should all go through because that's what TS is using I'd assume. Unfortunately it looks like typescript uses a hand-written parser. I traced it down to `parseJsonText` which is defined in [`src/compiler/parser.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/6487d1ffe0d903b1e55a187ddeb973fe0d445a2f/src/compiler/parser.ts#L717). Ahahaha.\r\n\r\nIf we're allowed to hook into the typescript package, it looks like [they provide public access to their parse function](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/760393f893358a462b00eef7e8fb92342b0f71ad/lib/typescript.d.ts#L3644).  I might be reading this wrong but doesn't this just disable the rule? Will things like\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconstructor(props: MyProps) {\r\n  super(props);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill get reported as they IMO should?  v3.0.0\r\n\r\nThere seems to be cases where eslint rule \"no-useless-constructor\" will give false positives when used with typescript\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\n  constructor(private readonly x: number) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat constructor is not really useless since it will assign the given parameter to this.x, so maybe consider dropping that rule for now for typescript?\r\n  > warning \"react-scripts > pnp-webpack-plugin > ts-pnp@1.1.1\" has unmet peer dependency \"typescript@*\".\r\n\r\nI've published `pnp-webpack-plugin@1.4.3` which should fix the problem (`typescript` is now an optional peer dependency of `ts-pnp`; we only were using it for the TS types).   It turns out this already works but adding an explicit test for it doesn't hurt.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nKind of.

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTypescript, debugging, source map...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\nCommand: `npx create-react-app my-app --typescript`\r\nOutput: \r\n\r\n> npx: installed 63 in 7.994s\r\n> \r\n> Creating a new React app in at C:\\\\*******************\\my-app.\r\n> \r\n> Installing packages.

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimply try to debug TypeScript, specially with `await`/`async`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n The problem is with the debugger (probably source-maps). When you start to debug your TypeScript app, it's keeping hit the *generated* JavaScript code, which cause a very uncomfortable debugging experience.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8597700/56467786-1d095400-642c-11e9-8a60-a70f6b5e41c3.png)\r\n\r\nWill go to after one step (even no \"step into\"):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8597700/56467797-36aa9b80-642c-11e9-8643-92d6ea5f2cfd.png)\r\n\r\nAnd it will be very hard to come back to the TypeScript after.\r\n\r\nMoreover, If you open Chrome's debugger, after an `await` command, some legit lines will not be \"debuggable\" - it will not allow you to set a break point there,\r\n\r\nFew years ago, I've created a React app (JavaScript) and ejected it to configure things manually to move to TypeScript and fix the debugger - and the debugging was smooth.\r\nThis time, I'm created a new app, and you have a native support of TypeScript so I don't want to eject it and change things inside. I think that it should be natively supported, so this is the reason that I opened this issue,  Thanks for your reply.\r\n\r\nI tried to replace the `browserslist` to just `last 2 Chrome version` but it acts the same.\r\n\r\nDo you have another suggestion for solving this?  The `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` package [just released](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/pull/250) an update that allows to specify custom resolution schemes. This makes it possible for Create-React-App to have native PnP support even when using TypeScript.\r\n\r\nI've tested this diff locally and it seemed to work. Fast work!\r\n\r\nQuestion: I don't see usage of the https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin in this PR. Is use of the pnp-webpack-plugin no longer required when working with webpack? Until https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve/pull/168 gets merged the `pnp-webpack-plugin` package is needed for everything that uses `enhanced-resolve` (basically Webpack itself). Since it's already been configured in #5136 I don't need to add anything else.\r\n\r\nIn the case of TypeScript, since it uses its own resolution instead of `enhanced-resolve`, the only package that I need to add is `ts-pnp`, which connects the living PnP environment with the existing TypeScript resolution algorithms. Yep - running `yarn test` then pressing `a` got the default test green.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can remember, Jest just uses Babel to strip the TS types, so no particular TS resolution involved - it simply uses the classic Jest resolution (which supports PnP out of the box since 24.5). Can't wait for this aha Any blocker? No, I think this looks good. Thanks for the reminder. \ud83d\ude00  Thanks! \u2764\ufe0f   I was having some problems with webpack and updated from 3 -> 4 and also updated some webpack/react related packages. \r\nI'm trying to run tests with jest and I'm getting an error. \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nLinux Mint 18.3\r\nNode 8.11.2\r\nNPM 6.9.0\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. npm run test  (jest --watch)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nJest should run tests\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTest suite failed to run\r\n\r\n    ReferenceError: [BABEL] /home/mmrj9/nexchange/nexchange-open-client-react/config/polyfills.js: Unknown option: /home/mmrj9/nexchange/nexchange-open-client-react/node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/index.js.overrides.

AFAIK as we use the WorkboxWebpackPlugin, we'd need this to land https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5369 first so you could add runtime caching (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/generate-service-worker/webpack#adding_runtime_caching) I can confirm @petetnt is right. I am also waiting #5369 to be merged. There is no runtime caching implemented out of the box.  I want to add a parent directory to src. Can create-react-app be configured? I don't want eject or \u201creact-app-rewired\u2018\u2019 You can't without ejecting. You are free to add any directories to the root of your project to add things like documentation, but you won't be able to import any JS files from a directory outside of `src`.  Thank you for doing this. \u2764\ufe0f   Fixes #6838. I think we probably want to say something like `Create React App 2+` or `Create React App 2 and above`. Fixed, @iansu.

In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n I'm not sure this is a bug? According to the documentation linked, Object.assign and spread have slightly different behavior. I think we favor spec compliance to performance, even if it's rare to encounter an edge case. I have tested the options of loose and useBuitIns. \r\n\r\n1. `loose: false` and `useBuiltIns: false` will use object spread from `node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/objectSpread.js`\r\n\r\n2. `loose: false` and `useBuitIns: true` will be the same as the first one.\r\n\r\n3. `loose: true` and `useBuiltIns: false` will use esm_extends from `node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/esm/extends.js`. According to the documentation linked, enabling loose will use the Babel's extends helper and it is correct and if we toggle useBuiltIns too it will use Object.assign. Therefore, just by setting useBuiltIns to true has no effect on anything.\r\n\r\n4. `loose: true` and `useBuiltIns: true` will use Object.assign. Okay. What I should ask is if we do not want loose to be enabled, then why enable useBuiltIns? I tracked this down to #902 and it looks like the intention actually was to use Object.assign. So maybe this is a bug? Reading [this](http://2ality.com/2016/10/rest-spread-properties.html#spreading-objects-versus-objectassign) it seems like the differences between the two are minor, but I don't know enough to say for sure and I don't want to be responsible for a breaking change :') \r\n\r\nIn either case though we should update by either removing the comment and the option or setting `loose: true`.  Specifying the directory as part of the repository field in a\r\npackage.json allows third party tools to provide better support when\r\nworking with monorepos. For example, it allows them to correctly\r\nconstruct a commit diff for a specific package.\r\n\r\nThis format was accepted by npm in [npm/rfcs#19](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/19).\r\n Thanks @feelepxyz - can you provide details of any packages using this approach now (this is for my own interest) :) @mrmckeb yes we're using at @dependabot to link to the package and commit view from the PRs we create.

I'm closing.  Initial work on improving asset manifest. This moves the current output of all files under a `files` key. This is a breaking change so we want to do this as part of 3.0. This will allow us to add additional information to the manifest under other top-level keys in the future.

Which are still wrong. I am trying to install create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts and install the node-sass package, but my scss styling is not working, could you please help to solve the issue React-scripts-ts is deprecated.  Use the --typescript option @ianschmitz\r\n\r\nYes, the previous issue suggested that the docs indicate to remove CRA globally (or that you cannot have it installed globally) and use the `\u2014typescript` flag to create a CRA TS project.\r\n\r\nThis is correct, however it is not reflected in the docs, and is, IMHO unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to get this to operate correctly I couldn\u2019t just install CRA locally, I had to remove it globally first.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re using TS on every project, as you probably are unless you\u2019re just starting out, it would seem you should be able to install globally and still use this flag, else have to reinstall every time. If you\u2019re not, for some reason always using TS, then you can\u2019t ever install globally for use with just JS, either.\r\n\r\nRegardless, there\u2019s no caveat in the docs that I could find indicating that this was an issue. That should be updated, especially with the prevalence of TS these days.\r\n\r\n > There's isn't a need to explicitly install CRA globally anymore with `npx` available. Using npx ensure you always use the latest version of our CLI w whenever you are bootstrapping a new app.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate that, as you can see that wasn't my first move; I took the \"old school\" approach and relied on the fact that I _already_ had it installed globally, looked up the flag for installing using TS and it didn't work.\r\n\r\nI went and found a GitHub issue that described the issue I was having, and here we are. I never looked at your home page in the docs because I wasn't pointed there and my Google search didn't return that result, it returned the GH issue. (I'm saying this as an example of how user interaction would commonly go, not as a complaint).\r\n\r\nWhen viewing the GitHub page I'm suggesting to update, there was no indication that having CRA installed globally would cause the issue I am seeing.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth updating the docs, specifically that page as well, to indicate what you just said. It's not clear that having it installed globally would cause a conflict.\r\n\r\nYou have this on the Getting Started page, I'm simply suggesting to add it to the TS page, as well, maybe with a note about possible conflict:\r\n\r\n> If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version. That sounds reasonable. Please send a PR for the docs. Closed by https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6945.  Hello,\r\nI am confused by `\"esnext\"` in `lib` for TypeScript. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"lib\": [\r\n\t\"dom\",\r\n\t\"dom.iterable\",\r\n\t\"esnext\"\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this mean I can use e.g. `flatMap`? Who provides the polyfill?\r\n\r\nBackground: I am in the process of migration from `CRA-TS` to `CRA2`. Previously we implemented our own `flatMap` and used `es6` as library. But why is `esnext` the default then? Won't it make people think that `flatMap` is available...? ...`flatMap` being just an example of something that's in `esnext` but not available in most browsers Thanks for detailed explanation! Back to `es6` for me... the future is still not there :-)   ### To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Installation of CRA\r\n2. I have a few hundred images and for each I have one sound clip (MP3)\r\nthus, Approximately 1800 http requests for static media, total size around 10MB\r\n\r\n- I use simple import to import each image and import each MP3\r\n- I am NOT using any third party outside of CRA other than bootstrap, very very simple app\r\n- I have NOT customized any of the SW code\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the project as simple.\r\n\r\nOn a normal modern phone and fast internet, it goes all fine...\r\n\r\nI got some old phones testing on it, either it crashes after the home page or just crashes chrome completely... either way, even on a modern phone it takes time before showing \"add to home screen\" and tester users have similiar and related experiences...\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\nI looked at many articles online including the user guide where it suggests - in certain situations - content into the public folder\r\n\r\nThe other idea was to eject ( but I dont' want to do this if possible)\r\n\r\nEither way, is not ideal as I then lose the prefetching as I want to keep the PWA feature.\r\n\r\n--------------- BUG???\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong or is it a bug with Service Worker in that it causes the crashing?\r\n\r\nThe pre-fetching aspect, should this not be throttled in someway? It seems like it was tested on high speed internet connections and not older slower internet/devices?\r\n\r\nShould the user really have to wait for ALL assets to be loaded before they can \"add to homescreen\"\r\n\r\nIf the user goes from home page to page 1, then surely it the pre-fetching should \"stop\" and browser load the contents on that page as highest priority?\r\n\r\nMy app is relatively small like 0.5MB the static assets are 10MB i.e. images and audio, so how do I maintain a PWA and avoid all this crashing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I also tried lazy loading, but this does not work as the PreCaching ignores this\r\nI also tried lazy/suspense on components, same thing PreCaching is super eager to get things done :)\r\n  The basic premise is to have some version annotation attached to build made. It's shown in the app UI so it's clear what features/fixes are to be expected there. We are using `serviceWorker.js`, pretty much unchanged from the original.\r\n\r\nI've managed to generate `version.json` inside the `build` directory with a little `prebuild` script. The version is based on last commit SHA1.\r\n\r\nThat file is deployed with a build and can be fetched in runtime. However, that's not correct, because it will always grab the latest from the server while app might not be the latest on the client side (especially with workbox).\r\n\r\nThe version file probably needs to be bundled in to make it more resilient. That comes with obvious challenges as I need to reference an existing file (in \"src\") when importing it from app source, but replace it with a generated one on a build. It feels weird to import from \"build\" folder.\r\n\r\nAt first, I thought to employ webpack aliasing so I can reference real file in \"src\" while in dev mode and the generated one from \"build\" otherwise. However, the alias name cannot be a filepath apparently, so that won't work either.\r\n\r\nNext idea was to write a small webpack loader to handle it, but `import version from 'versionManifest!../version.json'` is a problem for TypeScript. Perhaps a webpack plugin? That feels like awful overkill.\r\n\r\nI think I am out of ideas here. Such a simple problem and it doesn't seem to have an easy path \ud83d\ude16 Or I am overlooking something obvious. Oh, you mean like write those generate values inside the `.env.production.local`? Hm, I suppose that could work out, although it feels a bit strange touching file that is supposed to be static. We don't have a CI build (yet), so writing to env file will have to do for now. Thanks for the help, this should be sufficient.  Added a slight scale up on the get started button upon hover. > It's strange there is no change on hover!\r\n> \r\n> Maybe we should go with a simpler fix - perhaps a color change, for us turn white on hover - similar to https://docusaurus.io/ or https://sorbet.org/. That would also match the styling of the edit button on https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI think that's a good idea! @amyrlam That change has been made.  Nit is good. Suggestions added.  I have run into an issue where `npm test` which works perfectly with current stable CRA doesn't work with CRA3 if the testing instructions in the docs are followed.\r\n\r\nI have created a [repro](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/cra-3-npm-test) showcasing this deterministically, just run `npm test` in it.\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce are:\r\n\r\n1. `npm create-react-app . --typescript`\r\n2. `npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer`\r\n3. `npm install --save-dev @types/enzyme @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16`\r\n4. `setupTests.ts` as per https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests#src-setuptestsjs\r\n5. `npm test` still works!\r\n6. `npm install react-scripts@3.0.0-next.b0cbf2ca` #6475\r\n7. `npm test` now says it cannot find any files! `App.test.tsx` sits right there.\r\n\r\nNow sure if this is caused by TypeScript or not, I have not tried to see if this reproduces with the JavaScript version of CRA3.  Hello,\r\nI would like to know if it is possible to set a path mapping in react-dev-utils package when calling launchEditor.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful when we run our app inside a docker container with different path than that of the host machine. Actually, when clicking on the error overlay, it could not open the file in the editor since the path to the file is different.\r\n\r\nThanks  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate-react-app -V\r\n2.1.8\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"www\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts-ts start\",\r\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts-ts build\",\r\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts-ts test --env=jsdom\",\r\n    \"eject\": \"react-scripts-ts eject\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"node-sass\": \"^4.11.0\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-scripts-ts\": \"3.1.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"@types/jest\": \"^24.0.11\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"^11.13.4\",\r\n    \"@types/node-sass\": \"^4.11.0\",\r\n    \"@types/react\": \"^16.8.13\",\r\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^16.8.4\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"^3.4.3\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: 44.17763.1.0\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.17763.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

But I want to add classes anyway. So I can affect the styling of the button from the \"outside\" of the React-app (e.g. the global CSS-file of the website, which includes my React-app).\r\n\r\nThe perfect solution for me, would be to define class-names, which get hashed and are used in the default way by the style-loader, combined with readable class-names which can be used from \"external\" css-files.\r\n\r\n`<Button className={ classnames(styles.button, 'style-your-button-with-this-class') } />\r\n`\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n`<Button class=\"da39a style-your-button-with-this-class\" />`\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this possible?

But `npm test` is working fine as expected. So I believe this is not a system specific issue as the environments for both projects are same. Try [brew install watchman](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51168732/1647656)? > Try [brew install watchman](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51168732/1647656)?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know *why* watchman is suddenly required? > @tim-rohrer [I think this is the relevant issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/713), or maybe the jest issue it links to.\r\n\r\nAs I understand things, and am experiencing on my system, [this is the more relevant issue](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767#issuecomment-248883102). However, in my situation, I'm not on Sierra nor have I been for years. But, installing `watchman` seems to have solved the issue. That is good.\r\n\r\nBut, it still isn't clear to me what is actually requiring `watchman`?  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen running `react-scripts test --env=node` in a local package in a monorepo that uses TypeScript, `react-app-env.d.ts` is generated and placed within the `src` directory of the package. This clutters up the `src` directory unnecessarily for packages designed to be libraries for the main application.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have an option to disable the generation of `react-app-env.d.ts` in this scenario. \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`react-app-env.d.ts` is only generated for the main application.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`react-app-env.d.ts` is only generated in every package, regardless of whether it is needed or not.\r\n @fastfedora This is part of our TypeScript verification script, which we could look to change in future.\r\n\r\nHowever, the root of the issue seems to be that you're using `react-scripts` to build a library for your application. This is not the primary goal of `create-react-app`. Can you share more information about your goal? We might be able to help you find a better (and faster) solution. What's the reason for it existing `react-app-env.d.ts` the first place? It doesn't seem to provide any functionality for the app; the only thing it does is reference the types for `react-scripts`, which my app codebase doesn't reference.\r\n\r\nI am building an app using `create-react-app`, it's just that I've divided the app into separate sub-projects to share code between different parts of the app. So it's not a library, though it has libraries as sub-projects within the repo to help share & manage code. In the future, I may add other app projects (such as a React Native sub-project) within the same repo, sharing the same code.\r\n\r\nRight now, my development structure looks like:\r\n\r\n`/src`\r\n: The main app and the original CRA installation\r\n\r\n`/functions`\r\n: Firebase cloud functions, created as its own sub-project.\r\n\r\n`/scripts`\r\n: Command-line scripts for manipulating Firebase, created as its own sub-project\r\n\r\n`/packages`\r\n: Sub-projects (\"libraries\") used by the app, functions & scripts\r\n\r\nThough this may change so that `src`, `scripts` and `functions` are all underneath `packages` to better take advantage of Yarn Workspaces / Lerna.\r\n\r\nRight now none of the sub-projects contain components, but I'll be moving shared components into a sub-project soon so I can start building the library for future apps.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs when I run `yarn test` in one of the sub-projects and I have the `test` script configured to run `react-scripts test --env=node` (and once I have component sub-projects, I'll use `react-scripts test --env=jsdom`).\r\n\r\nThere may be a Jest configuration that can be used to avoid this; the reason I'm using `react-scripts` is because all this comes pre-configured and I don't have to worry about configuring everything separately.   I just started playing with React through create-react-app and was surprised when I wasn't warned about unused variables.\r\n\r\nI had a look [at the ESLint config](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L172) and it seems like it should. However, it isn't working for me and someone else on Reactiflux Discord confirm it wasn't for them.\r\n\r\nMy setup is VS Code 1.33.0 on Windows 10 with the ESLint 1.8.2 extension on a fresh create-react-app app. I added this code in the `render` method of the `App` component in _App.js_:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst a = 123;\r\n\r\neval('oh yeah');\r\n```\r\n\r\nVSCode shows a squiggly green line under the `eval` as an ESLint warning, so I know that's working. Nothing for the unused variable however. Same deal if I run `npx eslint src/`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npx eslint src/\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\alext\\src\\react-tutorial\\src\\App.js\r\n  9:3  warning  eval can be harmful  no-eval\r\n\r\n\u2716 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould this be causing an ESLint warning with CRA? I have configured my editor as per those directions, but I am also not seeing an error in the server terminal.\r\n\r\nI did a little more experimenting and found out that the issue was only with a variable named `a`. If I change it to `b`, I get an error both in my editor as well as in the server terminal.\r\n\r\nI saw that the default App.js has the following JSX\r\n```\r\n<a\r\n\tclassName=\"App-link\"\r\n\thref=\"https://reactjs.org\"\r\n\ttarget=\"_blank\"\r\n\trel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\r\n>\r\n\tLearn React\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a whim, I removed it, and now suddenly both my editor and terminal complain about the unused `a` variable. So it would seem as if ESLint is getting confused and thinking that the `<a>` in JSX refers to that variable...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the next steps should be, but I wasn't able to repro this issue in the [ESLint online sandbox](https://eslint.org/demo/). Could it be specific to CRA's linting setup? That sounds like a bug with ESLint and/or that particular rule. I'd suggest opening an issue with them. If you do please link to the issue here.  NPM version: 6.4.1\r\nFresh environment, new packages. (react, mobx, mobx-sync, localforage)\r\nI've been looking at issues around .mjs support and mobx, but not finding a solution to the issue yet.\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 7\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 0 @ 3.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.9600.18347\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.4 => 16.8.4\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.4 => 16.8.4\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.8 => 2.1.8\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreated a react application, imported mobx and mobx-sync along with localforge for persistence. Configured mobx which appeared to work without issue. Configured mobx-sync, build fails with error:\r\n./node_modules/mobx-sync/lib/decorators.mjs\r\nCan't import the named export '__assign' from non EcmaScript module (only default export is available)\r\n\r\nInspecting decorators.mjs:\r\nimport { __assign } from 'tslib';\r\n\r\nInspecting the tslib package.json:\r\n  \"main\": \"tslib.js\",\r\n  \"module\": \"tslib.es6.js\",\r\n  \"name\": \"tslib\",\r\n\r\nIt seems that while the mobx-sync module (index.mjs) reference to decorators is going to decorators.mjs, the reference to tslib isn't going to the module tslib.es6.js, but possibly the tslib.js file?\r\n\r\nmobx-sync contained both .js files and mjs, so I tried deleting the .js files from the lib folder in case some reference here was unresolved. No joy.\r\n\r\nIf I remove tslib.js from the tslib package folder, the react-script build run fails with a missing package error. If I substitute a copy of tslib.es6.js for tslib.js, it builds further, but then errors trying to resolve dependencies from mobx. (Again probably linking CommonJS rather than ES6)  I did the same copy-across trick for the es6. This appears to have worked, but a hackity-hack. \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe .mjs references should continue to propagate as ES6 modules for further dependencies. I don't know if this may be a bug with how react-script is resolving the .mjs files, or possibly a problem with how mobx-sync is building its package. I have not tried ejecting the configuration and applying the mjs webpack override changes that were considered for react-script and then rolled back since the eject is not reversible.   Looking for ideas or eyes from individuals that have a lot more experience with webpack and react-script/create-react-app than I.\r\n\r\n  I understand [the docs specifically call out](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development#configuring-the-proxy-manually) that the `setupProxy` file does not support additional languages. However, without TypeScript support, the `setupProxy` file cannot import other TypeScript code from within `src`.\r\n\r\nMy use case:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// src/setupProxy.js\r\n//\r\n// @ts-ignore: isolated modules error\r\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');\r\nconst backends = require('./common/backends');\r\nconst addressInfo = backends.getServerAddress();\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\r\n  app.use(proxy([\r\n    backends.apiRoot,\r\n    backends.graphqlRoot,\r\n    backends.mediaRoot,\r\n  ], { target: `http://${addressInfo.host}:${addressInfo.port}/` }));\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in an error, `Cannot find module './common/backends'`, which makes sense because `./common/backends` is a TypeScript file. However, I would be able to require this file if my project were JavaScript.\r\n\r\nWithout this, I'll have to duplicate the `addressInfo` and path locations from `backends` in `setupProxy`.\r\n\r\n @dannycochran, we'd be open to a PR if you'd like to take a look? If not, I can have a look for you - as I understand this is something we should address. @mrmckeb I can take a stab at it. It looks like it's registered here, yeah?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/30ee52cf3b2cbb6ac70999c02b1196bcaba8d4ca/packages/react-scripts/config/webpackDevServer.config.js#L96 Correct, I thought it might be as simple as using [`@babel/register`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register) when loading that file, but there may be a much better solution.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nHi there! Docusaurus team here! We're currently developing [Docusaurus 2](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/issues/789) and are almost done with an MVP that doesn't include translations and versioning features, which means there's feature parity with CRA's current usage of Docusaurus. We'd like to dogfood v2 on CRA mainly to try out the migration process with existing v1 sites.\r\n\r\nDocusaurus 2 brings about many improvements:\r\n\r\n- Client-side rendering with prerendering (site works without JavaScript!)\r\n- More flexible appearance - Customizable layouts, CSS modules, etc\r\n- Embeddable interactive React components within markdown via MDX\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n\r\n- Documentation for v2 isn't quite ready yet, but given that CRA is not using too many features of Docusaurus, that's probably ok.\r\n- ~We use CSS variables in v2 and hence IE11 isn't supported. We plan to support a way to build an IE11 compatible version which replaces CSS variables entirely with its values, but it won't be arriving that soon.~ **Update 4/16/19**: This is done.\r\n\r\nWould the CRA team be open to dogfooding v2? We would do the initial migration and help out with any issues that arise. There aren't too many breaking changes. If you all are agreeable, we plan to kick off the process in May. Let me know what you guys think!\r\n\r\ncc @endiliey @JoelMarcey  Thanks @amyrlam! Keep me posted! \ud83d\ude04  I'm on board with this. I agree that it would be nice to do this on a branch so we can test the new version out. Once v3 matches the current functionality we use we can roll it out.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

I've noticed the CPU usage of the `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` idling at around 70% and going even higher when the development server via `yarn start` is recompiling. \r\n\r\nMy project is only a handful of files but I too am using `@material-ui/icons` and after seeing this post, removed the module, and now the `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` is idling at a much more reasonable 10% via htop or so. That still seems a bit high but I'm not sure what is typical for the process and it is at least 7 times better.\r\n\r\nJust to add to the original post with some additional information since @CloneXpert is on Windows...\r\n```\r\nOS: Mac OSX 10.13.6 (High Sierra)\r\nNodeJS: v10.15.3\r\nnpm: 6.4.1\r\ncreate-react-app: 2.1.8\r\nyarn: 1.15.2\r\n```\r\n\r\npackage.json dependencies...\r\n```json\r\n\"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@material-ui/core\": \"^3.9.3\",\r\n    \"@material-ui/icons\": \"^3.0.2\",\r\n    \"@types/jest\": \"24.0.11\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"11.13.0\",\r\n    \"@types/react\": \"16.8.12\",\r\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"16.8.3\",\r\n    \"axios\": \"^0.18.0\",\r\n    \"react\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.6\",\r\n    \"react-scripts\": \"2.1.8\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"3.4.2\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT** It looks like this may be related to how the icons (**and how many**) are being imported. For example, instead of importing something like:\r\n```\r\nimport { Error} from '@material-ui/icons';\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be more narrow like:\r\n```\r\nimport ErrorIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Error';\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is what is being described on the NPM page [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/icons#imports). Using this approach, I'm able to reduce the CPU usage of the `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` to the 10% or so that I mentioned above when I removed the module/icon usage altogether.  I find it very difficult to trace down what's causing this. Can anyone help with identifying what packages can cause this? I removed material icons completely and still have the same issue in my bigger application.   Thanks for the suggestion. I did try and it was much faster as others were suggesting. However it doesn't solve the issue reported here. The fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin still has a never ending high CPU usage. It works if I kill it, but it will respawn immediately after I save a change. I am still unable to point out what's causing it.  Having same issue as @clonexpert Haven't experienced it myself - I've heard about memory issues with a recent release of TypeScript; possibly related. although new TS versions don't work properly, I found out version above 2.1.4 of 'react-scripts', cause high cpu usage and CPU temperatures pikes.\r\nUsing 2.1.3 and everything fine.\r\nCan somebody else confirm this please? Thanks Pedro, that's super helpful.\nDowngrading to 2.1.3 does indeed work much better. CPU usage dropped almost completely. So I guess it's a matter of finding out what change may be related to this in 2.1.4. Thanks everyone for looking into this.  @CloneXpert One good feature was **async type check**.\r\nFiles were deployed right after compiling, and you could browse through the website while type checks were made (that usually take some seconds)\r\nIt was a really good improvement from 2.1.5+\r\nBut I don't really want a flying MacBook Pro.\r\nEven 1 build would spike CPU temperatures and max Fans.\r\n\r\nGot reports from other developers using macbooks, with the same issue.\r\nLinux users don't seem affected with v2.1.8, hope this helps There's some suggestions here that might be worth looking into: https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/issues/236#issuecomment-484049558\r\n\r\nI'm open to PRs that remedy any issues.

Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm proposing this change to fix `Conflicting order between` errors coming from `mini-css-extract-plugin`. It seems like these warnings are pointless when using CSS modules\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/issues/250#issuecomment-447346852  Using Synk, I found security vulnerability from package `node-pre-gyp` in the package tar. This was discovered on Synk April 4 2019. \r\nPlease see Synk screenshots\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-04-10 at 9 55 58 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46582740/55898366-477b2780-5b77-11e9-8c95-156661caa5f7.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see details about this vulnerability here\r\n[https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAR-174125](url)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-04-10 at 10 00 30 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46582740/55898465-827d5b00-5b77-11e9-9ae4-4ab54919b3bd.png)\r\n\r\nBecause, I imagine many teams will not be able to use React Scripts. What is the best way to go about this? I filed an issue with the `node-pre-gyp` team but it seems like to fix this we will need `fsevents` to be updated as well. Any ideas? \r\n npm i node-pre-gyp There isn't really anything we can do to fix this, other than updating these dependencies when new versions are released. If you just install node-gyp, you'll have that issue. Installing node-pre-gyp too removes the problem.\r\nThe tar dependency is a problem of node-pre-gyp, not of node-gyp. Apparently there is a version 2.0 of fsevents that does not have a dependency to node-pre-gyp. Maybe bumping the version of fsevents could fix this. I'm not sure if that would cause a breaking change to react-scripts. > If you just install node-gyp, you'll have that issue. Installing node-pre-gyp too removes the problem.\r\n> The tar dependency is a problem of node-pre-gyp, not of node-gyp.\r\n\r\nSadly this doesn't work for me - still get the audit errors Then another option I read about is to play with package-lock.json (set all tar to updated version),  and use npm ci instead of i\r\n\r\nsource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15806152/how-do-i-override-nested-npm-dependency-versions\r\n\r\nhope this helps more than my previous > There isn't really anything we can do to fix this, other than updating these dependencies when new versions are released.\r\n\r\nGiven that there is a high security risk vulnerability, would it be possible to push out a minor/patch update for react-scripts that does just that? @kaiwen-zhang-ck managed to get a fix [https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp/issues/446](url)\r\n\r\nI've just updated the tar version in the package-lock.json, saved and ran `npm audit` again, and yeah it sorts it Is it a good practice to change package-lock.json directly? I thought we should not @adred8 I'm not sure if it's good practice, seen plenty of people saying to do it, but I don't know for sure.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I've noticed that after updating package-lock and doing an `npm install`, the package lock is overwritten to the vulnerable version again.  My current thinking on this is that as `npm audit` only looks at package.json and package-lock and not node_modules, updating package-lock to a secure version of tar(>4.4.2) doesn't eliminate the insecure version in node_modules.\r\nfsevents is an optional dependency, requiring a mac.  As I'm on windows, can anyone with a mac confirm fsevents is in node_modules still? \r\nAlso unless I'm wrong because the dependency is only installed on mac, windows users could ignore the warning?  In the article I cited they say that if you use npm ci (clean install) it shouldn't overwrite the changes you did in the .lock.json\r\nGive it a try. And no, I don't think it is a nice practice, you are just doing it as a quick fix. Same issue here on ubuntu.. I would be happy of this small fix in the react-script since we are now dealing with high vulnerabilities... @amdp I shall give it a try.  I wasn't doing it as a quick fix, I'm pretty new to dealing with dependency trees and trying to get my head around doing things well and understanding why Keep in mind I am a noob as well so I am -maybe- just good at explaining what other people were showing as a solution kaiwen had posted the answer in another thread, which I shared above. I was trying to point people with the same issue to his solution, and confirm that it worked for me (even though it later didn't seem to be. Hopefully get time tomorrow to look at it again! Updating all `\"tar\"` locations in package-lock.json to use `\"tar\": \"^4.4.8\"` manually solved my issue. @HarisSpahija But how did you do that if node-gyp requires `^2.2`? > Updating all `\"tar\"` locations in package-lock.json to use `\"tar\": \"^4.4.8\"` manually solved my issue.\r\n\r\nThat solves the issue, but its not a good practice to directly update dependencies in package-lock.json.  > There isn't really anything we can do to fix this, other than updating these dependencies when new versions are released.\r\n\r\nExactly, you need to update the versions, especially all the tar version under react-scripts package to 4.4.2 and above to remediate Arbitrary File Overwrite vulnerability.    Yes, like I said, we will update these packages. A new version of `fsevents` has been released and there is already a PR updating our dependencies. we there yet? ;P Just came across it now. @ianschmitz yes, 3.0 is good.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nTypescript\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 7\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v3 @ 2.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - ~\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.9600.19301\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.8 => 2.1.8\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

It infers `(Date | null)[]`. Interestingly, it will error regardless of whether you have switched to use workspace/VS Code version of TypeScript.\r\n\r\nWhen you add a new file outside of `src` and place this snippet there, it will not error and will correctly infer the `Date[]` type on `filtered`. Again, this is regardless of what version of TS gets chosen in VS Code, it will infer the right type.\r\n\r\nI do not understand how this could be a CRA issue, but CRA is the only environment I can reproduce this in. I have prepared a [repro](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/cra-ts-weirdness) for you to check out which shows this.\r\n\r\nIs this really a CRA error or should I report it elsewhere? Probably an eslint error. You can add \"as const\" after the array to suppress the error if you're using TypeScript 3.4 I am - the latest version of CRA seems to be.

This is almost certainly because you're running Node 11. Compilation of native modules with `node-pre-gyp` breaks frequently on new versions of Node. Try using Node 10 instead. Yes.

This _probably_ will not change; create-react-app is built for running in a normal browser environment. But I feel your pain, as our electron app at work uses ejected cra :') So the proposed solution is to eject and remove that line that mocks out the one module that I need? I assume then that there's no way to override CRA's webpack configuration, since that's the point of CRA managing the configuration of the project, is that right?\r\n\r\nAlso, if I eject my actual project, what do I need to know about that? Will things break? Do I need to learn all of webpack?  Or should I change what preset wepack uses in my `package.json`? For this particular issue, I think removing that one line would fix it. As you said, there's no way to configure webpack with stock CRA, but there are some alternatives.\r\n\r\nEjecting is honestly rough as it puts you in-charge of a very complex webpack setup. However, the web moves fast, and most of your application code will be relatively build system agnostic if you stick close to CRA's conservative feature set. We ejected back in v1 and it continues to work for us. Webpack has become much more sane in later versions, so touching it to once every six months hasn't been bad.\r\n\r\nThere are some other projects that purport to make CRA configurable, though I'm not very familiar with them. The [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) repo may be a good starting place. [Here's](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/alternatives-to-ejecting#docsNav) a page from the docs that talks about alternatives to ejecting. And there are other projects that are similar to CRA but allow more configuration. I've heard of [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) but am not at all familiar. Good luck! I ejected and commented out line 653, but no luck, somehow. The error is different, but on the same subject/line/problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./node_modules/electron/index.js\r\nModule not found: Can't resolve 'fs' in 'F:\\freelance\\repos\\cra electron fs\\fstest2\\node_modules\\electron'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think I know enough about webpack to figure out what's going wrong where on this. I committed up to the test repo, just in case: https://github.com/arcandio/fstest2/tree/ejected\r\n\r\nSince my react code is separate from the project configuration, would it be plausible to come at this the other way by starting with an electron app and adding in react? I understand doing so this might not be relevant to the CRA project. Sorry I missed your reply! Have you tried changing target to `electron-renderer`? From looking at [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/3012). The crux is that webpack will inline require statements (its whole job as a bundler), but you really need the require statement to stay as-is and resolve at runtime. I _think_ changing the target will make this happen naturally, but honestly it's been over a year since I've touched our webpack config. Let me know! How would I do that, concretely? I don't know what target you're talking about, and I can't find \"target\" in webpack.config.js or package.json, aside from the final build package. Is that what you mean? Just add it as a key at the top level of your webpack config. [Here's the documentation on target.](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/) Alright, tried adding \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst options = {\r\n  target: 'electron-renderer'\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut still no luck. @arcandio do you have found anyone solution? @arcandio, @heyimalex I found solution without `eject`, with https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco.\r\n\r\n`craco.config.js`\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    webpack: {\r\n        configure: {\r\n            target: 'electron-renderer'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check that `BrowserWindow` has `nodeIntegration: true` property:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew BrowserWindow({\r\n    width: 800,\r\n    height: 600,\r\n    webPreferences: {\r\n        nodeIntegration: true\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n Thanks guys. @heyimalex's PR seems to have fixed the issue. Follow #5498 for the final solution  As far as I can tell there's no reason for the webpack `babel-loader` to be a dependency of `babel-preset-react-app`. If you happen to use `babel-preset-react-app` without Webpack you get a warning like\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning \"babel-preset-react-app > babel-loader@8.0.5\" has unmet peer dependency \"webpack@>=2\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was another PR #6124 but it wasn't merged for some reason.  \r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\nyes\r\n\r\nI use yarn to create react app,when it success,when I use yarn start ,it will report that $ react-scripts start the system could not find the specified path ,but when I use npm start ,it can run success,I want to know why\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34003033/55845583-0d108b00-5b75-11e9-906c-ffe51ca63e0c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34003033/55845721-958f2b80-5b75-11e9-8939-7c4dc3a4f13a.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34003033/55845774-ce2f0500-5b75-11e9-8951-4c1ebc414288.png)\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nyes\r\n\r\nHave you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\nyes\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34003033/55845815-f61e6880-5b75-11e9-9214-e99a6553657f.png)\r\n\r\nThis is my file structure\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34003033/55845878-32ea5f80-5b76-11e9-9dd8-c631a45e4976.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n Please fill out the issue template so we can help you.  <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

Hi @Sylvenas, that's interesting... does it work for other file types, such as SVG?\r\n  Pinning all of our dependencies causes issues with the preflight check whenever a new version of a nested dependency is released. `babel-jest` is one example of this. When a new version is released and used by another dependency the preflight check fails until we update our version to match.\r\n\r\nWe should consider unpinning certain dependencies like `babel-jest` and updating the preflight check to work with carrot versions like `^24.7.1`. It currently only works with exact version numbers. The preflight check folder is `<rootDir>/node_modules`. Maybe `<scriptsVersion>/node_modules` should be check first. Jest 24.8.0 breaks it again.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `npx create-react-app someapp` and then run `yarn start`. It gave me the following error.\r\n\r\n> yarn run v1.15.2\r\n> $ react-scripts start\r\n> \r\n> There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.\r\n> It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.\r\n> \r\n> The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:\r\n> \r\n>   \"babel-jest\": \"24.7.1\"\r\n> \r\n> Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.\r\n> However, a different version of babel-jest was detected higher up in the tree:\r\n> \r\n>   /Users/eddiechen/github/someapp/node_modules/babel-jest (version: 24.8.0) \r\n> \r\n> Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.\r\n> \r\n> If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\r\n> That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.\r\n> \r\n> To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:\r\n> \r\n>   1.

My guess is that any command that fails you can just add `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` before it for now.\r\n\r\n```SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true yarn start``` Everything mentioned above results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting the development server...\r\n\r\n\r\n<--- Last few GCs --->\r\n\r\n[3450:0x33a7100]    96265 ms: Mark-sweep 1370.9 (1424.0) -> 1369.9 (1424.0) MB, 1980.0 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.098, current mu = 0.001) allocation failure scavenge might not succeed\r\n[3450:0x33a7100]    98223 ms: Mark-sweep 1371.1 (1424.5) -> 1370.1 (1424.5) MB, 1957.0 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.052, current mu = 0.001) allocation failure scavenge might not succeed\r\n\r\n\r\n<--- JS stacktrace --->\r\n\r\n==== JS stack trace =========================================\r\n\r\n    0: ExitFrame [pc: 0x16c69525be1d]\r\nSecurity context: 0x37af7ed9e6e9 <JSObject>\r\n    1: SourceMapGenerator_addMapping [0x148b9ae37b89] [/home/jdarling/su360/gateway/src/public/node_modules/@babel/generator/node_modules/source-map/lib/source-map-generator.js:~94] [pc=0x16c695bcfa18](this=0x37925ba82201 <SourceMapGenerator map = 0x1cd3fe538759>,aArgs=0x0d1e0617c339 <Object map = 0x25e847ee1e71>)\r\n    2: arguments adaptor frame: 3->1\r\n    3: ...\r\n\r\nFATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\r\n 1: 0x8dc510 node::Abort() [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 2: 0x8dc55c  [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 3: 0xad9b5e v8::Utils::ReportOOMFailure(v8::internal::Isolate*, char const*, bool) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 4: 0xad9d94 v8::internal::V8::FatalProcessOutOfMemory(v8::internal::Isolate*, char const*, bool) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 5: 0xec7bf2  [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 6: 0xec7cf8 v8::internal::Heap::CheckIneffectiveMarkCompact(unsigned long, double) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 7: 0xed3dd2 v8::internal::Heap::PerformGarbageCollection(v8::internal::GarbageCollector, v8::GCCallbackFlags) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 8: 0xed4704 v8::internal::Heap::CollectGarbage(v8::internal::AllocationSpace, v8::internal::GarbageCollectionReason, v8::GCCallbackFlags) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n 9: 0xed7371 v8::internal::Heap::AllocateRawWithRetryOrFail(int, v8::internal::AllocationSpace, v8::internal::AllocationAlignment) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n10: 0xea07f4 v8::internal::Factory::NewFillerObject(int, bool, v8::internal::AllocationSpace) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n11: 0x114018e v8::internal::Runtime_AllocateInNewSpace(int, v8::internal::Object**, v8::internal::Isolate*) [/home/jdarling/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin/node]\r\n12: 0x16c69525be1d \r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr some variant for me.  Last week same code no problem, this week everything is broke. Ok, if anyone else is still suffering make sure you delete your node_modules folder, yarn.lock (or package-lock.json) file, and clear your cache.  yarn cache clear (in my case).  Then do a clean install.  Unfortunately for those of us on 3rd world internet connections that can mean hours of waiting.\r\n\r\nThanks for forcing jest down our throats and not locking versions down so it could screw us. Inflammatory yes, very unfair and unproductive, not at all.  Can I install or use create-react-app without having Jest installed even though I don't use Jest, nope (statement is accurate and thus fair).  On more than one occasion has Jest broke backward compatibility by not following semantic versioning rules, yes (statement is backed by historic evidence, provokes a response and thus is productive).\r\n\r\nThe testing package should be a dependency that acts as an addon like everything else, not a default.\r\n\r\nMy statement is completely accurate and I stand by it. It is not unfair or unproductive - it just puts the finger in the wound. Jest and React are developed by Facebook and I strongly recommend an inhouse NPM registry powered CI pipeline to run against ALL projects such as Yarn, Jest, React etc. before you guys deploy to the public registry and break thousands of projects and builds.\r\n\r\nI did a little \"kind of stupid\" math but it shows the scope:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4676703 downloads per week (react)\r\n 668100 downloads per day (react)\r\n\r\n1h ~ average time to research and fix an issue like this one\r\n\r\n668100h = 76years\r\n\r\n36 years ~ average time of a career\r\n\r\ncongrats, 2 developers have been killed today\r\n```\r\n\r\n This project isn't Jest or React and none of the maintainers of Create React App work at Facebook.

Does `npm init react-app my-app` need it either? @verde79 I'm pretty sure that `npm init react-app my-app` does not require create-react-app to be globally installed; reading the [docs for init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) it seems like it uses npx under the hood. I'm also facing similar issue on mac, don't understand what is the issue.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-05 at 12 18 37 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36756634/57183495-61383200-6ecb-11e9-8a36-39a96536f95e.png)\r\n More details:\r\nI tried all commands to create react app:\r\n\r\n`create-react-app my-app`\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-05 at 12 21 59 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36756634/57183539-2d114100-6ecc-11e9-836c-a4973f6cad4a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n`npm init react-app my-app`\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-05 at 12 22 17 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36756634/57183545-3c908a00-6ecc-11e9-91cb-370d243d9a44.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n`yarn create react-app my-app`\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-05 at 12 22 53 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36756634/57183547-4dd99680-6ecc-11e9-8031-698fdee05f8c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput file:\r\npackage.json\r\n![Screenshot 2019-05-05 at 12 23 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36756634/57183552-5d58df80-6ecc-11e9-8022-98c708c5aa2f.png)\r\n Working now.

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nClone the CRA base into a local working directory (./cra1 as an example).\r\nClone it again into another local working directory (./cra2 as an example).\r\n\r\nRun `npm run build` on both folders.\r\n\r\nNote the \"compiled\" filenames are different but their content is the same.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing.

It could be a bug, or it could be an issue with how I am handling my forked version of react-scripts (https://github.com/Soulpicks/create-react-app).\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nyarn 1.15.2\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.3\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7360U CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.2/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.15.2 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.2/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 73.0.3683.86\r\n    Safari: 12.0.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.4 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.4 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn install @soulpicks/react-scripts\r\n./node_modules/.bin/soulpicks-react-scripts build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nTo build like react-scripts would have built. It builds successfully with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn install react-scripts\r\n./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen building with my version of react-scripts (called `soulpicks-react-scripts`) it fails to build with:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n./src/form/validation.tsx\r\n  Line 10:  Parsing error: Unexpected token, expected \"]\"\r\n\r\n   8 | type TValidationRuleTypes = 'generic' | 'name' | 'type'\r\n   9 | type TValidationRule = {\r\n> 10 |     [k in TValidationRuleTypes]: {\r\n     |        ^\r\n  11 |         [key: string]: TValidationTest[]\r\n  12 |     }\r\n  13 | }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also noticed it is installing different dependencies: https://www.diffchecker.com/z1tM9kte For example, my forked react-scripts installs `babel-eslint@10.0.1` but react-scripts installs `babel-eslint@9.0.0`.\r\n\r\ncreate-react-app was forked on the 14th of March, and I have synced with the upstream branch twice.  The `InlineChunkHtmlPlugin` plugin didn't work when the `publicPath` variable is empty or unset (e.g. when I want to use relative URLs).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n- If `publicPath` was unset or wasn't a string, webpack would throw an error\r\n- If `publicPath` was an empty string, the plugin would fail to inline a chunk\r\n\r\nNow: the plugin behaves as expected even with empty or unset `publicPath`. n.b. for other reviewers, this is _not a bug_. It only affects users who eject from Create React App or use our plugins in non-CRA applications. I mean, it _is_ a bug. It just happens to only affect people who eject from CRA (like my case). Still, it's not less of a bug :) @Timer any update on this? When can it be merged? Ping :) Thanks!  Using the latest `source-map-explorer`, running `npm run analyze` would throw an error (`No file(s) found`). This fixes it.\r\n\r\n I believe they are.  I checked this week that current instructions works correctly.  Can you provide a screenshot on the commands you ran? My environment is windows 10:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4154003/55309929-73075f00-545f-11e9-8461-f67af4261be8.png)\r\n cf https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer/issues/106 Thanks for the clarification.  I agree it is a windows only issue.\r\nHowever your fix doesn't work with mac.\r\n```\r\nyarn analyze\r\nyarn run v1.15.2\r\n$ source-map-explorer build/static/js/*.js\r\nUsage:\r\n  source-map-explorer <script.js> [<script.js.map>]\r\n  source-map-explorer [--json | --html | --tsv] [-m | --only-mapped] <script.js> [<script.js.map>] [--replace=BEFORE --with=AFTER]...

Thanks for the comment  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nTypescript 3.4 introduces `as const` syntax. However, using `create-react-app` with `--typescript` doesn't support this syntax yet, because it uses an older version of `@babel/preset-typescript` that doesn't support `as const`. PR https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/commit/3c9c21a2858a3397cceca51b3a299878b29c5c7b updates this dependency, amongst others, which fixes this issue but it hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `npx create-react-app my-app` etc.\r\n2. add some variable to `app.tsx` that uses `as const`\r\n3. App crashes: `unexpected token`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"612\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-03-30 at 19 35 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10089969/55280242-f66f6600-5322-11e9-85c2-22b21707161f.png\">\r\n\r\nAlternatively, following the same steps directly from the `create-react-app` source code doesn't result in the app crashing.\r\n Thanks for the clarification!

So I turned to `yarn`, which I have been using for angular development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.1\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4258U CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.3 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.15.2 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 73.0.3683.86\r\n    Safari: 12.0.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.6 => 16.8.6 \r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.8 => 2.1.8 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 2.1.8\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n`note:` Errors occurred so many times both the time I am using `npm init react-app my-app`, `npm start` and `yarn create react-app my-app`, `yarn start`, but I think the ERRs referred to the same problem.

Hey,\r\n\r\nIn this PR I added support for connecting to a WS server on a different origin than the one of the current document (useful in cases where the app HTML isn't served by the CRA dev server). See https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/4468 for more info.\r\n\r\nTo do this I used the [same approach as WDS](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/v3.1.9/client-src/default/index.js#L30-L39): instead of using `window.location` in every case, try to use the url of the current script.\r\n\r\nTo test this feature:\r\n- Test it's still working in the simple case:\r\n  - Run `yarn start`\r\n  - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser\r\n  - Edit `packages/react-scripts/template/src/App.js` and save\r\n  - See the page hot-reload, as before.\r\n- Test it's working when serving the HTML from a different port:\r\n  - Run `yarn start`\r\n  - Create a temporary directory: `mkdir tmp`\r\n  - Get a copy of the app's HTML with links to the CRA dev server: `curl localhost:3000 | sed s_=\\\"/_=\\\"http://localhost:3000/_g > index.html`\r\n  - Run a second test server locally: `python -m http.server 8000`\r\n  - Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser\r\n  - Edit `packages/react-scripts/template/src/App.js` and save\r\n  - See the page hot-reload, as before\r\n    - It might be blank after the reload, that's because the `*.hot-update.js` part of the html is out of date, re-running the `curl` command above fixes it. @iansu @Timer can I get one of you to review this please? :) @iansu @Timer review this please, we need this patch:)  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nThere are no dependencies to recover, the whole folder is deleted after the installation fails\r\n\r\n$ npm --version\r\n6.9.0\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n\"Error: Cannot find module 'chalk'\"\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460  CPU @ 3.20GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Yarn: 1.15.2 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: 42.17134.1.0\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.17134.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWith node v.10.15.2 and npm 6.9.0\r\n\r\n1. npx create-react-app appName\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nAll the dependencies are installed, the React App is created so that i can run it\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe creation fails with this output\r\n\r\n```\r\nCreating a new React app in D:\\applications\\tests\\ecommerce\\client.\r\n\r\nInstalling packages.

(Note: `npm cache clear` is an alias for [npm cache clean](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/cache.html).) Hello @amyrlam thanks for your reply. Yes of course I tried clearing npm cache several times but unfortunately it did not resolve the issue. Gotcha, my hunch is that it's something with node/npm on your machine, these kinds of issues are tricky to debug async.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I notice is that `Node` is not listed under Binaries in your environment info. Here's mine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.4\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.15.2 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.9.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 73.0.3683.86\r\n    Firefox: 66.0.1\r\n    Safari: 12.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.5 => 16.8.5\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.5 => 16.8.5\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.8 => 2.1.8\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre you using `nvm-windows` or similar?

I discovered it after upgrading my existing project from `react-scripts` 2.1.3 to 2.1.8, and after some effort, I was able to pinpoint which part of the project was causing the problem. I then reproduced the problem in minimal form.\r\n\r\nThe steps seem to be:\r\n\r\n1. Set up a new Create React App project, with typescript.\r\n2. Create one TypeScript source code file that declares an interface, and implements a function that uses that interface as its return type. Export the function, but not the interface.\r\n3. Create another Typescript source code file, that implements a function. After the function body, add a static property to the function, that uses the return value of the function exported in step 2.\r\n4. Save everything and run `npm run build`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe build process finishes successfully, in under 10 seconds, with output like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time npm run build\r\n\r\n> cra-default-2@0.1.0 build /path/to/my/project\r\n> react-scripts build\r\n\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nCompiled successfully.\r\n\r\nFile sizes after gzip:\r\n\r\n  36.81 KB  build/static/js/2.f885ce20.chunk.js\r\n  762 B     build/static/js/runtime~main.a8a9905a.js\r\n  550 B     build/static/js/main.0748b6c2.chunk.js\r\n  539 B     build/static/css/main.8e316ad3.chunk.css\r\n\r\nThe project was built assuming it is hosted at the server root.\r\nYou can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.\r\nFor example, add this to build it for GitHub Pages:\r\n\r\n  \"homepage\" : \"http://myname.github.io/myapp\",\r\n\r\nThe build folder is ready to be deployed.\r\nYou may serve it with a static server:\r\n\r\n  npm install -g serve\r\n  serve -s build\r\n\r\nFind out more about deployment here:\r\n\r\n  https://bit.ly/CRA-deploy\r\n\r\n\r\nreal\t0m6.182s\r\nuser\t0m10.188s\r\nsys\t0m0.524s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe command runs, but never finishes until manually killed.

If I manually edit my `node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js` file, and change `useTypescriptIncrementalApi` from `true` to `false`, then it compiles successfully.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it looks like I can work around it by slightly changing my code. If I do any of these things, it will also compile successfully:\r\n\r\n* Change the component from a functional component to a class component\r\n* Call the exported function in a different part of the code (anywhere but a static property of a function)\r\n* Export the interface that's being used as a return type\r\n\r\nSo, it's probably a fairly rare issue. The main difficulty with it, is that the error message provided no information about which part of my code was causing the problem. I wound up having to add some `console.dir()` statements in `/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js` to find out which file was causing this. I also tried hacking my `react-dev-utils` to use the recently released version `1.0.0` of `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`, because I saw in its changelogs that there had been some `useTypescriptIncrementalApi`-related changes since `1.0.0-alpha.6`. However, that did not fix the problem. No I haven't - I've asked @agwells to try seeing if he can reproduce it outside of create-react-app:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/issues/234#issuecomment-476988479\r\n\r\nI'm going to try and help @agwells investigate it if he's game. With @johnnyreilly 's help, I've determined it's probably an underlying TypeScript bug. Specifically, this one: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29672\r\n\r\nSo I'll close this issue then. :)  ```javascript\r\n// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change\r\n// unregister() to register() below.

Maybe this only happens with yarn? I can reproduce with npm as well, same setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u279c npm run build\r\nnpm WARN lifecycle The node binary used for scripts is /Users/zach/.asdf/shims/node but npm is using /Users/zach/.asdf/installs/nodejs/8.12.0/bin/node itself.

Please run next command `yarn upgrade caniuse-lite browserslist`\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nCompiled successfully.\r\n\r\n<other stuff omitted for brevity>\r\n``` This is very weird. I just created a branch new project with 3.0.0 using `npx create-react-app test-app` and then ran `yarn build` in the project and I didn't see that message.\r\n\r\n@gaearon I pretty much exclusively use Yarn so I don't think that's the cause. It might be worth following up in the linked issue on browserslist to see if we can get them to remove this message.\r\n\r\n I figured out the problem. My global installation of `create-react-app` was on an older 2.x version. It looks like CRA [copies a cached `yarn.lock` into the project directory](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/create-react-app/createReactApp.js#L272-L288) when creating a new project -- so every app created by the older version of CRA will be locked to an older version of `caniuse-lite` out of the box. For my existing project, I was able to get rid of the warning by manually deleting the `caniuse-lite` entries from my `yarn.lock` and reinstalling (to allow them to float up to the latest version), and I no longer see the warning in a new project after upgrading to CRA 3.0.0 globally (which is also why @iansu could never reproduce - you were already on the new version of CRA globally). @schneidmaster I did notice you were using a global install of Create React App but you mentioned using version 3 so I figured you had updated it. If you were actually using an old version then it makes sense that you saw the message. But why is @gaearon seeing it? I'm guessing you're not using a global install, right Dan? Yeah, I had updated `react-scripts` to 3.0 in my existing project (which wasn't sufficient to force `caniuse-lite` to update ). I hadn't updated CRA itself. Worked for me: (h/t to @schneidmaster)\r\n1. `rm yarn.lock`  - delete yarn lock file\r\n2. `yarn` to recreate yarn lock file\r\n\r\nI don't recall which order of operations regarding upgrade of my global CRA install vs project update. For what it's worth, it should be sufficient to search `caniuse-lite@` in your `yarn.lock`, delete just those entries, and reinstall. That avoids the versions floating for all your other packages. @schneidmaster your suggestion is the only thing that resolved it for me. In my case I was unable to build if I updated all packages, and/or try to recreate the yarn lock file. I wasn't interested in fixing 100 build errors due to package upgrades atm! I'm also seeing this warning after upgrading from 2.x version of `react-scripts` to `3.0.0`. I'm using NPM, so the yarn workaround doesn't apply to me. I'm not sure how to get rid of the warning as I believe it's an issue with one of `react-scripts`' dependencies.  The \"project\" property has a significant performance impact on linting,\r\nand none our rules currently need it.\r\n\r\nFixes #6661.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

Let me know if we need any other changes.\r\n Hi @ianschmitz ,\r\n\r\nLet me know if any changes are needed.  Hi guys,\r\n\r\nWhen I try to build my project (`yarn run build`), I got this error:\r\n\r\n`Expected a pseudo-class or pseudo-element.`\r\n\r\nFull log:\r\n```\r\n\u03bb yarn run build\r\nyarn run v1.13.0\r\n$ react-scripts build\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\nExpected a pseudo-class or pseudo-element.\r\n\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\r\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and that's it. I assume there's some syntax error in some of the project's css/scss files. The problem is, this is a fairly large project and we recently did a major tech upgrade, including upgrade of many packages. I cannot fix this bug without specifying the error location. Is there any chance to include better error message? The parser must know what file it is operating over. `yarn run start` passes just fine. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, do you have any suggestions about possible methods of fixing this? Is there any tool for checking the syntax of css/scss files?\r\n\r\n`react-scripts: 2.1.3` I had to fork the scripts and add some logging myself to find a cause of the problem. Maybe it would be good to implement some command line argument (--verbose), which would include as much error information as possible into output. I would be super useful to get more verbose logs out from CRA. I'm trying to find out which part of the build process is the slowest, but it is nearly impossible to figure it out without having option for more verbose output.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

If it gains mindshare we'll be happy to include it.  Sometimes, there are issues that surface only on the production build. They may be related to minification, or other optimisations that break the production build, for example.\r\n\r\nWith Angular CLI, you can serve a production build (while in development mode). \r\n\r\n`ng serve -- prod`\r\n\r\nFrom their docs:\r\n\r\n\r\n> --prod=true\\|false | When true, sets the build configuration to the production target. All builds make use of bundling and limited tree-shaking. A production build also runs limited dead code elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm asking this question is that right now, I have an issue which is surfacing only on the production build of a project using react-scripts. I think this is a super useful feature and was wondering if there is an equivalent (other than the poor man's `npm run build && http-server ./build` - which may not work for a variety of reasons).  node -v\r\n 10.15.3\r\nnpm -v\r\n6.9.0  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\n(write your answer here)\r\nYes\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

The image below is the compare directory result between the reinstall one(left) and the broken one(right), and the only different is inside the `node_modules > babel-preset-react-app > node_modules > @babel`. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1278\" alt=\"\u87a2\u5e55\u5feb\u7167 2019-04-04 \u4e0b\u53481 59 33\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11377851/55544029-d104a280-56fc-11e9-93a2-c3cf22a594fc.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"\u87a2\u5e55\u5feb\u7167 2019-04-04 \u4e0b\u53483 50 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11377851/55544026-d06c0c00-56fc-11e9-8756-7f84144fb18d.png\">\r\n\r\nIt seems like after running `npx create-react-app my-app`, the node_modules has `babel-preset-react-app` inside, and when running `yarn eject`, although `react-script` removed from package.json and `babel-preset-react-app` replaced it, Yarn didn't resolve `babel-preset-react-app` again.\r\n\r\nI try to fix the broken one with `yarn remove babel-preset-react-app` and `yarn add babel-preset-react-app`  and it works. Maybe can add some script to clean up the `babel-preset-react-app` before or after yarn install, and it will be fixed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/e630238d0d5870aa0f20e487b12708935cf58737/packages/react-scripts/scripts/eject.js#L309-L312 \r\n@abel1105 Really good detective work! Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nI don't have a solution, but I can consistently reproduce this. Roughly here's what's up:\r\n\r\nnode_modules after `npx create-react-app issue_6679 --typescript`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\n@babel/preset-react/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/\r\n```\r\n\r\nnode_modules after `yarn run eject`. Here's where we're getting the error. If you run `yarn why @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self` it will tell you that it's installed because `@babel/preset-react` depends on it. However, that package isn't resolvable from the _nested_ `@babel/preset-react` in `babel-preset-react-app/node_modules` just because of how module resolution works.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\n@babel/preset-react/\r\n+ @babel/preset-react/node_modules/@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/\r\n```\r\n\r\nnode_modules after `rm -rf node_modules && rm yarn.lock && yarn`. Everything works again.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n@babel/preset-react/\r\n@babel/preset-react/node_modules/@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/\r\n- babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure what the fix is, or even how to search for this issue in the yarn issue tracker. But at least we have a handle on why it's happening.

This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called kill -9 on the process.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI contacted circle support and they told me that the build is consuming more than the 4GB of memory (!!!) allocated to my build server and thus causing the failure.\r\n\r\nThe troubleshooting documentation suggests that 1GB of memory should be sufficient.  \r\n\r\nIs there a setting that would allow me to reduce the memory requirements of the build, even if that mean it took a little longer?\r\n I sympathize, that's a lot of memory. You could try disabling source maps with `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`. If you need sourcemaps then I'm not sure what other options you have :( Any solutions? `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` solved the issue in that it doesn't fail anymore...but I need the source maps sorts its more of a temporary band-aid.  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6310\r\n\r\n@maniax89 you are more than welcome to review as well!

The decrease in performance isn't worth it just to have a progress bar.  In WSL, despite using a Windows binary browser, my `$BROWSER` environment variable is set to its *nix path `/mnt/d/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe` as opposed to its Windows equivalent of `D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe`. This causes openBrowser (from react-dev-utils) to fail.\r\n\r\nI noticed that openBrowser makes a call to `opn` where the root issue actually occurs.

You can follow the instructions [in our docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started#quick-start)\r\n\r\nAh, thank you. I was wondering why it wasn't working.  This bug looks like [this bug on webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8656), which was root-caused to [this bug on npm](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/152).

I don't get this error with react-scripts@2\r\nI suspect it has something to do with my user folder containing a space: `C:\\Users\\Jonas R\u00f8ssum` and somehow gets interpreted wrongly. \r\n\r\n There is an npm/npx bug with usernames that contain a space. I'm not sure if that's related to the dynamic import issue. Maybe try copying your code to a different directory, outside of your user's account, that doesn't have any spaces in the name. Even if that's not a good long term solution it might help us troubleshoot this.\r\n\r\nnpx also uses npm's cache which is probably why you're seeing an error with `--info`. I would try clearing the cache or at least removing `create-react-app` from the cache and then run that command again. @iansu Thanks for the clarification.  > I'm not sure if that's related to the dynamic import issue\r\n\r\nI don't think so: I have no spaces in my folder names (also I'm on MacOS, so it's not platform specific either) Hit this issue in `3.0.0` when trying to upgrade an internal project under node 8.11 (specifically the docker container `node:8.11.0-alpine`).\r\n\r\nI'll get a repo together that reproduces it, and see if this applies to imports with the file extension specified while I'm at it. Repo to reproduce issue https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/CRA-6673\r\nPresence of file name makes no difference. I got this running on another device as well to rule out the creation of a bad state. Tried to make sample as simple as possible to constrain area of investigation as much as possible. seems something going on package-lock.json.  removing it and reinstalling via npm install fixes the problem.  also a fresh install of yarn helps. @bugzpodder Indeed. Regenerating the lock file corrects my issue reproduction repo as well (the need for eslint to be installed at the top level hinted at this somewhat). Reports that regenerating the lock file isn't working implies that this isn't the cause, however its plausible that the regeneration isn't producing a valid dependency graph (as far as the code is concerned).\r\n\r\nMight be a bad mapping between dependencies and packages (packages depending on dependencies they don't explicitly declare) resulting in them on occasion not seeing what they expect. Having the same issue on windows, node 10 and without paths containing spaces. Is there a workaround for this? Would removing yarn.lock/package-lock.json and node_modules work @delaaxe  I have the same issue on MacOs, node 10, npm 6.4.1\r\nI have tried the suggested workaround (removing `package-lock.json`), doesn't help. Also our CI/CD pipeline is recreating form scratch everything and it fails over there too....  @bugzpodder Tried that a few times with npm. Will try again with yarn @kuzman Is this with a clean project as well (as in newly created using the CLI tool)? If not, could you put a list of your dependencies up? I'd like to see if I can get that scenario accounted for in my reproduction repo (https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/CRA-6673). I finally found a solution that works for me, suggested by @andybarsby and @kylehalleman \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6873#issuecomment-486205976\r\n\r\nRunning `npm i --save-dev acorn-dynamic-import@3` fixes the issue for me. No other solution have worked, I've tried all of these:\r\n - [Downgrading node version](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6673#issuecomment-473936044), as suggested by @ianschmitz \r\n - Removing package-lock.json and node_modules folder and running `npm install`\r\n - Tested different computers (issue still occurs)\r\n\r\nDoes updating the `acorn-dynamic-import` dependency solve the issue for anyone else? (for people, where the steps mentioned didn't solve the issue) Switched to yarn and worked as expected @joglr I have this problem and none of the previous suggestions worked for me. I tried your recommendation and can confirm it solves the issue for me Proposed workaround works for my reproduction repo as well.\r\n\r\nLooking in `package-lock.json` I can only see 1 other version of `acorn-dynamic-import` (v4) which is required by webpack. Tracking down something that uses `acorn-dynamic-import` but doesn't itself depend on it sounds like the next step towards getting this properly fixed. Doesn't look like anything else is depending on `acorn-dynamic-import` aside from `webpack`. By default, both packages are living at the top level in `node_modules` (no duplicate copies). Odd that adding the older version of `acorn-dynamic-import` fixes this issue at all since webpack shouldn't even be touching the top level one when its own `node_modules` folder has what it wants. That is, unless something has added a require hook and changed dependency resolution logic in the process.\r\n\r\nPerhaps related, perhaps not. I've been digging into webpack to try and track down where it all falls apart and I've noticed some errors in generated code. The first in `html-webpack-plugin` due to a strict mode violation (`with` keyword is used), and our failing source (unexpected token and `'import' and 'export' may appear only with 'sourceType: module'`). That last error could be a lead. Was facing the same issue. Adding `npm i --save-dev acorn-dynamic-import@3` fixed the issue. I had the same issue and fixed it installing `acorn@6`.\r\n\r\njest is using acorn@5 and looks like somehow it creates a problem. Also you can `dedupe` acorn.

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here if relevant.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible!

I am also logging most of the errors to the Sentry service. I am sending the `componentStack` from `componentDidMount` there as well, but since it's minified, it feels fairly useless.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1096340/54487116-1cf8c000-4892-11e9-9d46-29c39850a7f0.png)\r\n\r\nI am wondering what are my options if any. Since that output is pretty much just a string, the source mapping does not seem possible at any level. @iansu That surely won't work because the `componentStack` is just a string, there is no structured information to feed source mapping mechanism. Have a look at this example (used to showcase different issue).\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/zw500lpm2p Source map upload definitely doesn't help. I have it uploaded, my stack trace is decoded properly, but componentStack is not. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Oh come on, I hate this little blue thing. Just because there is no viable answer yet, it shouldn't be stale :( This is a real issue. Can someone please tell that robot it's ok to keep it open?

Hi @ianschmitz ,\r\nTaking this up. Hi @ianschmitz and @iansu ,\r\n\r\nSo i have added the one line code to kill the verdaccio ,but some other tasks are getting failed can you guide once.  Sync the `babel-eslint` version between react-scripts (version 3) and eslint-config-react-app \r\n```\r\nwarning \"react-scripts > eslint-config-react-app@4.0.0-next.b0cbf2ca\" \r\nhas incorrect peer dependency \"babel-eslint@9.x\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  It looks like it doesn't require type information, see [this test repository](https://github.com/jackwilsdon/typescript-eslint-no-unused-vars) I created.\r\n\r\nThis can be backed up by looking at the code too; any rules requiring type info call [`getParserServices`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/063518380215fc0b2df777080d247fe222cf258d/packages/eslint-plugin/src/util/getParserServices.ts#L11-L29) to get access to the type checker, and [`no-unused-vars`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/063518380215fc0b2df777080d247fe222cf258d/packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/no-unused-vars.ts) does not call this method.  Currently the generated service worker workbox version is:\r\nimportScripts(\"https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/3.6.3/workbox-sw.js\")\r\n\r\nThe latest is 4.1: see https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/releases\r\nThe import can now read as:\r\nimportScripts(\"https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/4.1.0/workbox-sw.js\")\r\n\r\nThis update improves a number of things, including adding the much needed skipWaiting() message handler:\r\nhttps://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/pull/1929 There are a number of issues with the service worker from the older version of the plugin. I ejected create-react-app and updated the version number in the package.json to **4.1.1** (latest version of workbox-webpack-plugin). \r\n\r\nMost of these issues have now been resolved in the new version, and **nothing else is required apart from updating the version number of the npm module**. This should be a relatively **simple update**.\r\n\r\n @iansu: Sure, I'll take this one up. @iansu: One more thing, I was having this [issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6243) on Chrome (on Windows 10) with version **3.6.3**, but updating it to **4.1.1 resolved it**. I can't reference the issue.

WRT TypeScript, I think you're good (Jest by default finds `ts` and `tsx`, but you have more opinionated paths on top of its defaults). Other things I noticed though:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b0cbf2caa18ee8267855b14578ebc3dee826f552/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/createJestConfig.js#L27-L31\r\n\r\nDitch `isEjecting` condition - we want `require.resolve` no matter what and not rely on the package manager hoisting things\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b0cbf2caa18ee8267855b14578ebc3dee826f552/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/createJestConfig.js#L38\r\n\r\nI'd prefer `require.resolve('jest-environment-jsdom')`; and add a dependency on it, but Jest has dependencies on `jest-environment-{jsdom,node}` so it'll be able to resolve these on its own. So you might not want that, although that means `jest` might load some other version of the env than CRA expects. Not sure if that's a feature or not\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b0cbf2caa18ee8267855b14578ebc3dee826f552/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/createJestConfig.js#L42\r\n\r\n`require.resolve('babel-jest');` instead of making assumptions about where in `node_modules` it resides\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b0cbf2caa18ee8267855b14578ebc3dee826f552/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/createJestConfig.js#L53-L56\r\n\r\n`require.resolve` at least on `identity-obj-proxy`. Maybe not RNW as that's up to the user and it should always be in the top level so Jest _should_ be able to resolve irregardless of package manager hoisting >Would you recommend using using theneva/jest-environment-jsdom-thirteen for `testEnvironment` as mentioned in the Jest docs?\r\n\r\nJSDOM 14 has come out, so I'd probably jump straight to that (not sure if anyone's released a jest environment for it yet, though).

What was the intention behind removing those fixes :thinking:   ### Ability to load PostCSS config file from project root directory if exists\r\n\r\nI believe create react app help to build awesome web pages and applications by the way developer face a lot of issues with styling their pages or applications now days more of PostCSS plugins reduce that workflows \r\n\r\neg: \r\n1. [stylelint](https://stylelint.io)\r\n2. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind)\r\n3. [PostCSS Assets](https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets)\r\n\r\nif create react app load PostCSS config file from project root directory if exists that will allow developers to configure their own configurations to build their awesome web pages and applications.\r\n\r\nThis is most useful for who like to run `yarn eject` but fingers is not allow it. @pavinthan  This seems like a pretty good idea. for using PostCSS plugins, I'm also facing those issues. thanks @ratheeps,\r\n\r\nIt's good to have `postcss.config.js` configurable, @iansu or any core team members could you please add your review about this ? @pavinthan, It's a good way dude. I hope it'll be more useful. @iansu if we need to add any PostCSS plugins do we need to eject react-script?  I don't know if this is being addressed in a separate issue (I couldn't find one), but I was wondering if there are any plans to add support for differential serving (also called \"smart bundling\"). I read [Philip Walton's article](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) about serving \"modern\" JavaScript to browsers that support it and polyfilled code to \"legacy\" browsers (like IE 11). This seems like a fitting case for CRA, because it targets modern browsers out of the box and needs [polyfills for IE 11 and lower](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features). I don't know if this is already on your roadmap or not? Ah, my bad, I searched high and low in the issue list but forgot to look at the pull requests! I'm following that issue, thanks.

This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNot really.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\nI saw https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3448 by @Xopsy and unfortunately this has been closed. However, I do have a legitimate use case for it.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is: Provide a way to e.g. pass `--dev` or so to `npm run build`, so I can get a build output in the same way as I get when running `npm start`, i.e. unminified.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nI've fairly documented that background in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55165466/how-to-build-a-production-version-of-react-without-minification (and [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55160698/how-to-use-react-without-unsafe-inline-javascript-css-code)) already, so I'll make it short: In browser add-ons (WebExtensions) minification is nearly useless as it is saved offline and can even cause problems, as inline JavaScript is included. I'm just saying, your situation is kinda unique which probably warrants ejecting; create-react-app can't be everything for everyone. There's [another issue for staging builds](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/790) you might want to track, but I doubt it'll handle all the constraints of your environment. > Do sourcemaps not solve your issue here?\r\n\r\nNo. I need the unminified source.\r\n\r\n> I'm just saying, your situation is kinda unique which probably warrants ejecting\r\n\r\nI respectfully disagree. I mean, browser add-on makers are possibly unique, I agree.\r\n_However_ this does affect everyone, who wants proper security by deploying a [security measure called \"content security policy\"](https://content-security-policy.com/) to prevent XSS attacks.\r\nSo it is not _that_ uncommon...\r\n\r\nAltghough it is not strictly neccessary to prevent minification, but [rather that JS/CSS is put inline of HTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55160698/how-to-use-react-without-unsafe-inline-javascript-css-code). Or should I open a new issue about the latter, if this is more realistic to be implemented here? Heh, you should have mentioned csp issues. This should solve your problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false npm run build\r\n``` I've linked to it all over the place \ud83d\ude09 \r\n\r\nBut, yes, awesome! That solves my use case totally!\r\n\r\nSo, @heyimalex, if you want, feel free to submit this as an answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55160698/how-to-use-react-without-unsafe-inline-javascript-css-code.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWe are using a .env file to make configuration changes easy between our different environments and it works great.\r\nHowever, the way that `dotenv` works it not particularly interesting as it:\r\n1. bloats the code (even minified)\r\n2. exposes all environment variables right next to each other (the values will become public anyway, but you don't need them to be right next to each other)\r\n\r\nIn our codebase, we have a couple of variables and this block is inserted six times into our code:\r\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://i.snag.gy/inUlpI.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn a project without create-react-app I've been using dotenv-webpack with great success. It effectively replaces your call to an environment variable with the value itself, minimizing code bloat.\r\n\r\nI believe this would be a small change in the code, but I was wondering if there are reasons not to do this? If there is no reason not to switch it, I would like to work on a PR. Just chiming in: it looks like you're using `process.env` dynamically, which is hard to resolve at compile time and is probably why it's including the whole thing? I don't have anything like this in my bundle. Maybe you have a function like this.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction featureIsEnabled(feature: string): boolean {\r\n  return !!feature && process.env[\"REACT_APP_FEATURE_\"+feature.toUpperCase()] === \"true\";\r\n}\r\n``` @heyimalex It took a while for me to get back to you but I finally found the time to do so.\r\n\r\nYou were right, I did have some dynamic reads like that in the code. I've now removed them and replaced them with static calls, but I still get loads of full listings in my final build.\r\n\r\nex.\r\n```\r\nvar version = \"\".concat(Object({\r\n    \"NODE_ENV\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"PUBLIC_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_AWS_REGION\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_AWS_USERPOOL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_AWS_CLIENTAPP\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_ZENDESK_KEY\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_ZENDESK_KEY_API\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_ZENDESK_URI\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_COOKIE_DOMAIN\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_REFERRED_KEY\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_REFERRED_VALUE\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_COGNITO_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_SUPPORT_API_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_TICKETING_API_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_EVENT_API_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_QUEUE_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_ENV\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_FEATURE_TICKETING\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_FEATURE_TICKETING_UNAVAILABLE\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_FEATURE_BRACELETS\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_FEATURE_DEV\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_BEASTMODE\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_ATTRIBUTES_API_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_FACEBOOK_PIXEL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_ALLOW_INSECURE_COOKIES\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_CONFIG_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_INTELLITIX_W1_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_INTELLITIX_W2_BASE_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_FALLBACK_URL\": \"XXXX\",\r\n    \"REACT_APP_REDIRECT_WHITELIST\": \"XXXX\",\r\n}).REACT_APP_VERSION || '0.0.0', \"-\").concat(REACT_ENV);\r\n```\r\n--> original\r\n```\r\nconst version = `${process.env.REACT_APP_VERSION || '0.0.0'}-${REACT_ENV}`\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother:\r\n\r\n```\r\npc(e, Object({\r\n  NODE_ENV: \"XXXX\",\r\n  PUBLIC_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_VERSION: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_FEATURE_TICKETING: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_FACEBOOK_PIXEL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_SUPPORT_API_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_FALLBACK_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_ENV: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_REFERRED_VALUE: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_AWS_REGION: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_AWS_CLIENTAPP: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_EVENT_API_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_INTELLITIX_W1_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_FEATURE_BRACELETS: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_INTELLITIX_W2_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_BEASTMODE: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_COGNITO_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_CONFIG_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_ALLOW_INSECURE_COOKIES: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_ZENDESK_KEY: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_QUEUE_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_COOKIE_DOMAIN: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_AWS_USERPOOL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_REFERRED_KEY: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_ZENDESK_URI: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_FEATURE_TICKETING_UNAVAILABLE: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_TICKETING_API_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_ATTRIBUTES_API_BASE_URL: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_REDIRECT_WHITELIST: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_FEATURE_DEV: \"XXXX\",\r\n  REACT_APP_ZENDESK_KEY_API: \"XXXX\",\r\n}).REACT_APP_ALLOWED_CALLBACK_DOMAINS)\r\n```\r\n--> original\r\n```\r\nisCallbackUrlAllowed(\r\n        callbackUrl,\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_ALLOWED_CALLBACK_DOMAINS\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese don't seem like very special cases to me?

Check behaviour\r\n\r\nNote: By \"Check behaviour\" I mean switch between the two routes (`Home` and `About`) and notice the background colours changing on the `Card` component. You'll notice that navigating through the app determines the styles of the card on different pages. \r\n\r\nCase 1: Start on `Home` => Navigate to `About` by clicking the link => Navigate back to `Home` => See that the card background is no longer pink, but white!\r\n\r\nCase 2: Start on `About` => Navigate to `Home` by clicking the link => Navigate back to `About` => See that the card background is no longer black, but white!\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI would expect the same behaviour in production development as in local development.\r\n\r\nThe CSS styles applied to our pages/components should be completely independent of how users navigate through the app. In this demo app, I'd expect the card to be pink on 'Home` and black on 'About' at all times (exactly how it behaves locally). \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nProduction build (probably due to webpack bundling the css according to my loadable routes) has different styling behaviour. Component styles (passed as `props.className`) are being overridden by default styles. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can\u2019t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you\u2019re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/haylorjulian/css-bundling-issue\r\n\r\nAlso hosted on Github Pages (haven't fixed the config issue so the card doesn't appear until clicking on `Home` - you'll get a 404 if you try to navigate directly to `/Home`)\r\nhttps://haylorjulian.github.io/css-bundling-issue/\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing.

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n This is leading to a number of nasty styling bugs in our code split application. Specifically, we see it a lot when passing classNames to common components to override default styles. These bugs first appeared when we upgraded from react-scripts `v1` to `v2` and looks to be due to the way the css assets are now split. Now, depending on the way you navigate around the app the order in which the css chunks are fetched may vary, this means the way the styles are cascading is not consistent.\r\n\r\nMigrating from 'plain sass' to css modules seems to fix the cases we've seen, but given the size of our code base it would not be a trivial task to migrate all of our styles across. It's also particularly nasty because the styling bugs are not present in dev mode so we often don't see them until production. Since upgrading react-scripts these bugs are now pretty prevalent in our web app, we massively appreciate the other features `v2` brings and would really like not to have to rollback!

This is all working but the CSS is embedded in these new JavaScript chunks and then seemingly dynamically loaded into the page. This is giving me a bunch of randomly named stylesheets loaded in all on the homepage of my website as shown below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16683916/54297472-db74c600-45ae-11e9-85fc-2b71eed03fca.png)\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\n1. Why are ALL of the styles for all of my code-split chunks being loaded? I have split my code on routes currently so there's no need for any more than one of these stylesheets to be loaded on the homepage (corresponding to my homepage.[hash].chunk.js file).\r\n\r\n2. This is causing an issue with my PageSpeed Insights report. It's telling me to serve these assets with an efficient cache policy. How am I supposed to do this with CRA?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16683916/54297876-9e5d0380-45af-11e9-908f-3b69e1b82ea1.png)\r\n\r\nI would like the CSS from each of these chunks to be in separate files rather than inside the JS file and then loaded in dynamically. Can I accomplish this without ejecting and modifying the Webpack config myself? I would really like to avoid that if possible. Apologies. This was all caused by using an old version of react-scripts.\r\n\r\nSee here for more details: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55145921/separate-css-files-using-create-react-app-code-splitting-without-ejecting\r\n\r\nThis can be closed.

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here if relevant.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible!

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n  create-react-app is using [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) that's why I think we should add lerna badge.  <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

I tried this on other computers and I couldn't reproduce it.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.3\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 8.15.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v8.15.1/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v8.15.1/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 72.0.3626.121\r\n    Safari: 12.0.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 2.1.8\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.  `npx create-react-app my-app` or `npm create-react-app my-app`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should create a new boilerplate app with create-react-app\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe most common error i got is this: \r\n\r\n`error An unexpected error occurred: \"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@svgr/plugin-svgo/-/plugin-svgo-4.0.3.tgz: Request failed \\\"404 Not Found\\\"\".`\r\n\r\nBut sometimes, i will get one of those other errors:\r\n\r\n`\"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@svgr/hast-util-to-babel-ast/-/hast-util-to-babel-ast-4.1.0.tgz: Request failed \\\"404 Not Found\\\"\"`\r\n\r\n`\"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@svgr/babel-plugin-remove-jsx-attribute/-/babel-plugin-remove-jsx-attribute-4.0.3.tgz: Request failed \\\"404 Not Found\\\"`\r\n\r\nanother one which i found interesting:\r\n\r\n`npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@svgr%2fplugin-svgo - Not Found`\r\n`npm ERR! 404 '@svgr/plugin-svgo@latest' is not in the npm registry.

I think it was not setup correctly and raised issues to some scoped npm packages like @svgr  Yes, solved!             \r\nCreating new projects is also not supported\uff0c I'm experiencing the same issue when I created new projects @jericbas ic try gatsby.js - it has more mature approach to react app architecture concerning css modules and even typescript Hi @jericbas we can't help you unless you fill out the issue template and tell us exactly what error you encountered.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\njsdom\r\ntesting\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 10\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1270 v6 @ 3.80GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: 44.17763.1.0\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.17763.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.4 => 16.8.4\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.4 => 16.8.4\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.8 => 2.1.8\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `create-react-app jsdom-test`\r\n2.

We've had the need to allow usage of JSX, ESnext and TypeScript in all our codebase (a lerna monorepo) and just import those packages without build step into our react apps. We have a few react apps in our monorepo and they need to share components and helpers, data layer etc.\r\n\r\nWhat we did until now is having a build step for every single package but today we'd like to eliminate this step and just use raw sources without the build step.\r\n\r\nThis PullRequest will provide support for simple projects as well as monorepos using lerna v2 and v3 (I didn't check older versions). The idea is simple:\r\n1. Look at the current app as will Lerna do\r\n2. Get all local dependencies (dependencies of the current react app that is present in the monorepo)\r\n3. Treat code from there as code in `/src`\r\n\r\nDo you have any questions or suggestions regarding this?\r\nMarouane @fazouane-marouane your solution looks interesting, I had an issue that I think it'll be solved by that.\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/4517\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I'm sharing code between projects, without Lerna, I have the following folder structure\r\n```\r\n|_core\r\n|_web (uses core)\r\n|_mobile (uses core)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of them are using flow, but when I import something from the `core` project on the `web` project, the CRA doesn't understand the flow types on the external module. Do you think your PR will solve this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm having a two-step build, in which I transpile the `core` project to strip the \"flow syntax\". This is kind odd though. Hello @eduardomoroni,\r\n\r\nYes it would totally work without lerna... as long as you have a lerna.json file at the top of your workspace \ud83d\ude05so something like the following should work without using lerna:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"lerna\": \"2.8.0\",\r\n  \"packages\": [\"_core\", \"_web\", \"_mobile\"],\r\n  \"npmClient\": \"yarn\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\r\n  \"npmClientArgs\": [\"--ignore-engines\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this PR is being ghosted, I don't know if supporting only yarn workspaces instead would improve its visibility. But it would pretty much help the few (?) of us that need decent support of mono repos with create-react-app.\r\n I\u2019ll need this to stay open thanks @iansu @Timer @gaearon @amyrlam @mrmckeb @ianschmitz @petetnt @bugzpodder \r\n\r\nAny feedback on this issue?\r\nThanks :) FYI, I pushed it to npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerna-react-scripts I'll try keeping it up to date until some kind of minimal support lands in react-scripts.  Now that `react-scripts-ts` is archived we should catch users doing this and link them to our TypeScript instructions instead.\r\n\r\nWe should also explain `react-scripts-ts` is discontinued. Probably just a warning with an acknowledgement (press enter to continue).  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nI am unsure, since it might be the intended behavior or a limitation of `Babel`, but would greatly appreciate any explanation/help on the issue.\r\n\r\nI have tried migrating our project from `react-scripts-ts` to `react-scripts` with `--typescript` flag and I have noticed that the app doesn't get recompiled if I make changes in files that only contain type definitions. This makes it very difficult to recover from compilation errors, since changing types doesn't trigger compilation and reload. However when I re-save any other file that contains some \"actual\" javascript, then the app recompiles and reloads in the browser.\r\n\r\nI assume it is because since `Babel` now compiles `typescript`, it doesn't actually emit anything on files that only contain type definitions but only removes them, so when such files are changed `webpack` can't pick up the change since there is actually no change in the emitted files?\r\n\r\nIf I am right, is there any workaround to make it recompile if I change type definitions? In our project we have a lot of files dedicated only for type definitions, and if there is no way to trigger compilation if a change is made to those files, then we can't migrate to `react-scripts`.\r\n \r\nI am really eager to start using the \"real\" `react-scripts` instead of the ts-fork that is now deprecated, so I am thankful for any help on the issue!  Thank you for your fast response! \r\n\r\nDo you think there is a way to achieve the desired behavior and keep most of the configuration of react-scripts in a custom fork?  @ianschmitz you were right about the behavior in `react-scripts-ts`, it doesn't recompile when changing files with only type definitions. I am sorry for the confusion, I have no idea why I was sure it worked that way before :) Thank you for you help!  <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work. Bonus points for screenshots!\r\n\r\nHappy contributing!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfix #6591 \r\n\r\nI think I can solve the issue as follows. It is a problem to change the version of the module. Sorry. I can not solve the \"kitchensink-eject\" test.

Hope this helps.\r\n\r\nAs @Marjona6 stated it's fixed since version 24.3.0 so this issue should be closed. its not fixed in create-react-app since it doesn't bring jest 24 with it. It should be \"awaiting\" for this PR to be merged: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6278 NOT fixed when using create-react-app. I set node_js to 11.10.0 and jest to 24.3.1 and it still fails for the same issue on travis.

Thank you all. I solved this by using node 11.10.\r\n\r\n@Marjona6\r\nI think this is caused by setting the Symbol.toStringTag member to read-only on the process object as the node version goes up to 11.11.\r\n\r\nHowever, this can change in this PR(nodejs/node#26488) to Writable. So I'm not sure yet.\r\n\r\n@rpearce63, @DavidOD \r\nBoth are using node:alpine in Dockerfile. This version is 11.11.

I'll try specifying another version.  \r\n\r\nThanks...\r\n\r\nEdited to add:\r\nBingo. I changed my Dockerfile to use node:11.10-alpine and reran docker-compose up --build.

I'm going to commit that change and see if Travis succeeds.\r\n\r\n-- I updated the Dockerfile to use node:11.10-alpine and commited the change. The Travis build succeeded this time with the tests passing.   It took a bit to realise the version of node running on Travis was not the issue as this is a Docker image. It's the version of node running in the  container. Setting the image version to a pre 11.11 fixed it.\r\n\r\n>@rpearce63\r\n>Maybe the image of node:alpine already exists, so it was tested on 11.10?

Travis-Ci build success! \r\nConfirm: changing Dockerfile to use node:11.10-alpine has fixed my problems at travis-ci.  I did the same thing a couple of days ago and it didn't work, but now it does.  No need to change .travis.yml, or any other settings. Thanks guys. I was using `node:10.15-alpine` when I encountered this problem. I subsequently tried to\r\n- change Dockerfile to use version `node:11.10-alpine`\r\n- change Dockerfile to use `node:11.9-alpine`\r\n- regenerate `package-lock.json` and reinstall `node_modules`\r\n\r\nI cannot force the newer Jest version because I cannot use a separate `.env` file. My `.env` files are generated per environment. I don't really want to skip the preflight checks. I'm thinking I'll try different node versions until something works. I'm hoping this gets a `create-react-app` fix soon. If jest is in your sub-deps  -like `react-script` users- you can force your project to use an exact version like below:\r\n\r\npackage.json\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  dependencies: { \"bla\": \"bla\"},\r\n  \"resolutions\": {\r\n    \"jest\": \"^24.3.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` OK, my problem was that my `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` was using an unspecified version of alpine, which selects the latest one by default. It was a simple fix at the end and a silly overlooked mistake on my part. In other words I changed images with `node:alpine` to `node:10.15-alpine`. Hey guys, lot of people are subscribed to this issue to be warned when a fix gets released. Please may you refrain from posting all your very own personal solutions that explain how did you downgrade your Docker images to use node <11.11 please? None of the solutions in this thread have helped me, so yes, please refrain from posting what personally worked for you until a solution exists that works for everybody, this is frustrating. > None of the solutions in this thread have helped me, so yes, please refrain from posting what personally worked for you until a solution exists that works for everybody, this is frustrating.\r\n\r\nHow are you supposed to know if it works for everyone or not? @ianschmitz Yes, it solved the problem \ud83d\udc4d  [node 11.12](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V11.md#2019-03-15-version-11120-current-bridgear) fixed it Ok  - [x] provide dynamic babel config\r\n- [x] provide dynamic webpack config\r\n- [x] Add to react-dev-utils\r\n- [x] opt-in with `--modern`\r\n- [ ] optimize babel config (lose some polyfills)\r\n- [ ] test file size differences\r\n- [ ] write documentation about --modern\r\n\r\n\r\nFor now this is a WIP since I did not know if we wanted to opt-in by default or opt-out by default.\r\n\r\nSo when running the production `yarn build` at this point it will build your files with `.modern` and normal. This will be served when opening in chrome you will see the `.modern` in your network tab and when opening on IE11 you'll see the normal ones.\r\n\r\nAlso I have personally been advocating heavily for `.modern` bundles in libraries, this would impact file size differences even more, since now every library is shipped as ES2015 by default (I don't think this is feasible for now).\r\n\r\nbig thanks to @prichodko in [this PR](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/4964) which has heavily influenced the webpack plugin.\r\n\r\n[Own POC with polyfills for legacy and none for modern](\r\nhttps://github.com/JoviDeCroock/POC-ModularLegacyBuild)\r\n\r\nI would like to spark some discussion about the unfinished points before I continue if this is possible.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/projects/5#card-15632785\r\n\r\nEDIT: I would like to know what babel-preset-react-app/dependencies, from what I understand you transpile your deps down a bit more than usual. So in modern config we would just not include this?\r\n\r\nIf anyone has doubts about this feature, I recently made a big post about browser support etc [here](https://dev.to/jovidecroock/modern-bundling-4chm)\r\n\r\nNOTE: this needs a new publish of react-dev-utils Making your browserslist configurable seems pretty unrelated to this feature, this feature enables the developer to treat the evergreen users better while not dropping support for nevergreen. Yes, I really am all for what you said about the browserslist but I think this is also a big oppurtunity for projects willing to support older browsers and providing that little bit extra for their other customers.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would love to move forward with this feature whenever someone has time to talk about the points made in the start of this pr Hey could I please get some answers on these 3 points before I can continue (since the first fails my tests)\r\n\r\n```what to do with the webpack script on eject? --> add to react-dev-utils but how does publishing go?\r\n  Is this needed in development (?) IMO, not really\r\n  allow de-opt through cli, with a --legacy flag?``` Allright and how do I make the tests for eject work? Since this probably requires a utils release? Okay so the `--modern` flag works.\r\n\r\nNow all we have to do is optimise the config for modern browsers since this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile sizes after gzip:\r\n\r\n  36.4 KB  build\\static\\js\\2.073e8f0b.modern.chunk.js\r\n  36.4 KB  build\\static\\js\\2.71f54e92.chunk.js\r\n  770 B    build\\static\\js\\runtime~main.53198464.modern.js\r\n  762 B    build\\static\\js\\runtime~main.a8a9905a.js\r\n  598 B    build\\static\\js\\main.511e72ba.chunk.js\r\n  598 B    build\\static\\js\\main.d551d14c.modern.chunk.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all honest does not make it worth it ^^ note that these numbers were different before merging master in.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to what is stated here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/4964\r\n\r\nIn the previous PR they removed `transform-runtime` and some other plugins. I do not know how far we are willing to go with this since I'm not aware of the implications you have been through that you had to add these. I'll read up on the issues in the comments and try to make a calculated decision.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to get the feeling that something just overrides the babelconfig I'm making... Since the normal (not .modern) outputs are 8 bytes smaller...  When I implement the starting component as a class it shows a difference, the initial bytes more on modern do not make sense though. In vue cli they remove corejs in general for polyfilling. This is one of the differences being made here. `useBuiltIns: 'usage'` as used in vue makes the diff more significant\r\n\r\n```\r\n  36.79 KB  build\\static\\js\\2.8f71a45e.chunk.js\r\n  36.4 KB   build\\static\\js\\2.0ef311fe.modern.chunk.js\r\n  770 B     build\\static\\js\\runtime~main.53198464.modern.js\r\n  762 B     build\\static\\js\\runtime~main.a8a9905a.js\r\n  710 B     build\\static\\js\\main.a89b9cde.chunk.js\r\n  622 B     build\\static\\js\\main.86f918ca.modern.chunk.js\r\n``` I\u2019ll see if I can find any bigger applications, if you know any other things like for example not including object rest spread? Because modern ones have it?\r\n\r\nTesting with yarn link feels like a pandora\u2019s box of unresolved dependencies :/ it just keeps on saying it can\u2019t find x or y.... \r\n\r\nSpecifically typescript and related... got it fixed, diffs are so minimal as opposed to the 20% of previous pr/vue cli.\r\n\r\nThe best result I've gotten so far is 4KB off which in % was about 3, ofcourse libraries can't be transpiled \"up\" to ES6 and still make for a big part of the overhead but I still think it's weird to see our results making this small of a diff compared to the prev PR.\r\n\r\nDifferences on my own POC are also a lot bigger, going to try and find some time to debug this issue soon.\r\n\r\nI have published the plugin: this one is a little more flexible than the one provided in the cra code https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-module-nomodule-plugin  Specifying the directory as part of the repository field in a\r\npackage.json allows third party tools to provide better support when\r\nworking with monorepos. For example, it allows them to correctly\r\nconstruct a commit diff for a specific package.\r\n\r\nThis format was accepted by npm in npm/rfcs#19.\r\n This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

If you can't I'll do it but I'd prefer you get credited for it. @iansu hey just pushed a new fork https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6826  Hi!\r\n\r\nI've created a tool to measure and report webpack bundle stats.  It is similar to `webpack-bundle-analyzer` except it's a hosted service that reports this information directly into GitHub pull requests as Checks.  Telling you the net effect of your changes, whether they're growing your asset profile or not.\r\n\r\n![github-status](https://packtracker.io/media/github-status.png)\r\n\r\nI've recently launched support for apps using your tool, and thought the project might benefit from running these checks on it's pull requests.  Helping to make sure proposed changes aren't adversely effecting the tool's initial bundle size.\r\n\r\nI've also prepared a sample page showing the data of a blank CRA app.\r\n\r\nhttps://app.packtracker.io/organizations/2/projects/106/commits/a82afe1ba8d89320b54ebd77229d46f1b390f978\r\n\r\nhttps://packtracker.io\r\n\r\nIf I can be of any help getting this set up let me know! To be clear, I'm **not suggesting it be included in default configurations**,  only that it could be used to measure *this* project for unexpected asset growth in a fresh CRA app. Since we're touching bundle size analyzing.. Any chance for us to have a configuration option to disable it? It takes notable amount of time from the build script For sure, configured properly it should only report during the CI process.  Since we'd be using the CLI, it would actually be a separate process entirely to gather stats and report them.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.packtracker.io/uploading-your-webpack-stats/common-app-platforms/create-react-app\r\n This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

Create a file in `src` called `types.ts`\r\n3. Add the following code to `types.ts`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Person {\r\n  name: string\r\n  age: number\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { Person }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThis should be fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n/Users/zaynv/Projects/misc/example/src/types.ts\r\nType error: Cannot re-export a type when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided.

Is there really no way to fix this issue other than having to use `export interface X` and `export interface Y` everywhere instead of `export { X, Y }`?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nI can make one if necessary, but its basically just a new app with an exported type.\r\n\r\n You can check through the tracker for other issues about this to learn more about the why, but _I think_ the short answer is that it's a limitation of using babel to compile typescript, and so yeah you are limited by whatever restrictions `--isolatedModules` forces. Hmm, do you think this could be better documented in the [`create-react-app typescript docs`](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript#docsNav)? One of the notes say:\r\n\r\n> You are allowed to edit the generated TypeScript configuration.\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't exactly seem to be the case as the `isolatedModules: true` seems to be enforced in the config?\r\n\r\nAlso, it mentions:\r\n\r\n> Note: Constant enums and namespaces are not supported.\r\n\r\nBut I guess the `export` style I mentioned is another limitation. I can't be the only one who uses the `export { Type }` style at the bottom of the file over `export interface Type {}`, so do you all think it might be a good idea to mention it there? @ianschmitz Yes that works, I mentioned in the first comment that this way would work. I just think it's problematic that a certain style of coding is not allowed and is not mentioned anywhere  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\r\n\u2502 low           \u2502 Regular Expression Denial of Service                         \u2502\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\r\n\u2502 Package       \u2502 braces                                                       \u2502\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\r\n\u2502 Patched in    \u2502 >=2.3.1                                                      \u2502\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\r\n\u2502 Dependency of \u2502 react-scripts                                                \u2502\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\r\n\u2502 Path          \u2502 react-scripts > jest > jest-cli > jest-config > babel-jest > \u2502\r\n\u2502               \u2502 babel-plugin-istanbul > test-exclude > micromatch > braces   \u2502\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\r\n\u2502 More info     \u2502 https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/786                       \u2502\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\r\n\r\n  In [verifyTypeScriptSetup.js](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/df3e73f454f718dbb3f928ecf681a50467e5a18d/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/verifyTypeScriptSetup.js#L21):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    fs.writeFileSync(fileName, JSON.stringify(object, null, 2) + os.EOL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe code uses a combination of `JSON.stringify` and `os.EOL` - however JSON.stringify is [specified to (and does) always use `0x000A` as its linefeed](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-serializejsonobject), even on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe net result is that after building a `create-react-app` project on Windows, then `tsconfig.json` contains LFs all down the file until the last line, which is CRLF, as shown here:\r\n\r\n![screenshot_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11946605/53740049-301b9100-3e8b-11e9-85cc-65b50ce6ba2c.jpg)\r\n\r\n - This is not a user misconfiguration, it is the out-of-the-box behaviour\r\n - It occurs whenever `verifyTypeScriptSetup.js` rewrites this file on Windows\r\n - `tsconfig.json` ends up with linebreaks as shown above regardless of whether it was initially pure LF or initially pure CRLF\r\n \r\nIt is possible to achieve (what seems to be fairly evidently) the intent of the code by replacing all LF characters in the `JSON.stringify` output with `os.EOL` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    fs.writeFileSync(fileName, JSON.stringify(object, null, 2).replace(/\\n/g, os.EOL) + os.EOL);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NB** Even this is NOT necessarily what the user actually wants (for a Windows user, it depends on whether they are working with Windows linefeeds, or perhaps in Unix linefeeds because it is a cross-platform project).\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to do a PR, but suspect there may well be other places where this approach is used, and also note that there are two other uses of `os.EOL` in the same file (which again may or may not be what the user really wants for the reason just mentioned). If anybody from the `create-react-app` team is looking at this, I'd be happy to put in the fixed line above as a PR - but note the following which I think should be resolved/discussed first:\r\n - There seem to be potentially related issues which this alone might not fix (as mentioned above)\r\n - The simple fix (as suggested above) to the code line which has the problem will achieve what (it seems clear) the code was intended to do (but doesn't!), but still won't always do what the user actually wants\r\n    - Any suggestions as to any way to make the line ending used default to the correct for the OS - which I can do - but also be configurable *if the user needs it to be* would be good\r\n    - Actually, off the top of my head, I'd suggest that the tsconfig.json file *itself* could have a new config value saying which line endings it should use if/when re-written, with values `'windows'`, `'unix'` and `'native'` available, and defaulting to `'native'` (c.f. [this eslint project issue](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11458) - which somewhat naturally suggests that the new `tsconfig.json` setting could natually be called `'linebreak-style'` - but perhaps would be better as `'self-linebreak-style'`, to make it clear what it applies to)\r\n   - Again, I'd be happy to do the above as a 'more complete' PR (in the sense that it would actually, rather than only partially, solve the problems which the very fact of a re-write can potentially cause), and it would be fairly simple code, in the style of the existing file (if the approach just suggested seems reasonable to the team?), but still see the following point\r\n - I am not aware of what tests it might be appropriate to add for such a fix, and a suggestion as to where and what would help @ianschmitz I believe that `.replace(/\\n/g, os.EOL)` is sufficient, since `JSON.stringify` always and only produces `\\n` (it would be in breach of its contract otherwise).\r\n\r\nA PR for that and then (if I or someone else cares enough) a separate Issue and discussion as to whether or not it's worth doing anything at all about the small class of Windows users who have Git set to check out Unix linefeeds, would make sense. Dear Ian, I've put up a PR as requested, I'd obviously be happy to change it to use the more defensive coding you've suggested, if you'd all prefer.\r\n\r\n~[For some reason, CI builds on the project are failing for some reason nothing to do with the code pushed up - in the eject tests, the (docker?) image is causing the process to fail with a missing package error.]~ - EDIT: Now fixed. Just wanted to leave a note that the fix as applied works for users using native linefeeds (i.e. most people!), so many thanks! But still won't work for users using Unix linefeeds on Windows (or any other weird combination, but this is probably much the most likely one, and is even the recommended setting by [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/11458#issuecomment-470113644)!).

I am also having this issue. \ud83d\udea8  Did you try changing the main on the package.json to a .js file? You can build during the prepublish hook and use it at JS and TS projects (just bear in mind the definitions). Changing the target for es2015 could help. The thing is that I need access to external library source maps for debugging.\r\n\r\nBy the way, my solution was to get rid of CRA and use my own webpack-config. Now it works. I'm having the same issue. Symbolic links are able to be included in the project but they are not parsed correctly. I'm having this issue as well  Handles the following concerns:\r\n\r\n- Update Jest to version 24\r\n- Use `setupFilesAfterEnv` in Jest config instead of deprecated `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile` option\r\n- Add `setupFilesAfterEnv` to list of overridable Jest config options\r\n- Updated documentation to reflect new functionality described above\r\n- Clean up `createJestConfig`\r\n\r\nI'd like to note specifically that the logic associated with `setupTests` has been preserved, but it can now be overridden with Jest's shiny new `setupFilesAfterEnv` config option \u2728  It's quite frustrating that a very well documented issue is just automatically closed after a few months because it's marked stale, but I understand why such a thing would happen. Anyway, you can consider this a comment to this issue opened just a few months ago: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5865\r\n(I'll even move my comment to that thread if it's unlocked and delete this issue once I move it there to keep things cleaner)\r\n\r\nI am also having an unexpected token error on the first jsx angle bracket `<`\r\n\r\nI have components I placed in my package.json, which are pointing to git repo urls. Everything was working, until I need to create some webpack aliases. So I had to eject, and then the first error I got was this unexpected token error.\r\n\r\nI saw this related issue: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3491 But I'm quite sure @derpoho has exactly pinned the issue.\r\n\r\nI looked through his repo demonstrating the issue, and wanted to note his changes from a fresh create-react-app:\r\n-Added `import Packaged from './components/Packaged'` to App.js\r\nThis folder is very very simple. Just package.json with main entry pointing to pure functional component that returns a div: https://github.com/derpoho/cra-packaged-components-error/tree/master/src/components/Packaged\r\nThen he ejected. Also I can add that it chokes on the first line that contains a jsx `<` - even if that line of code is not the first line of jsx that would be executed in the app. (Cough cough - sorry I just explained the definition of a syntax error - but maybe it's helpful..)

will be more illuminating This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n I just met the same issue and found a workaround. Since Babel reports syntax error it usually means it's not configured correctly. So I guess if a folder contains `package.json` but with no `.babelrc`, `babel.config.js` such files in parent folders then it thinks there's no config.\r\n\r\nSo I created a `babel.config.js` in the project root rather that define it in `package.json`. Then it works.\r\nMy `babel.config.js` is as below:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = function(api) {\r\n  const presets = [\"react-app\"];\r\n  const plugins = [];\r\n  if (api.env(\"development\")) {\r\n    // plugins.push('react-hot-loader/babel');\r\n  }\r\n  return { presets, plugins };\r\n};\r\n```\r\nNote that you must contain `if (api.env(\"...` otherwise it throws errors. I don't know why maybe `api.env` does some tricky things.\r\n\r\nHowever, sub-folders with package.json just worked in my previous project with old cra and babel :-(  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nnot so sure\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n`yarn 1.13.0`\r\n`Debian Stretch`\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n[git repo](https://github.com/epgeroy/create-react-app)\r\n1. `npx create-react-app my-app --scripts-version react-scripts-p1`\r\n2. `cd my-app`\r\n3. `vim src\\p1.config.json`\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"entryPoints\": {\r\n      \"main\": \"src/index\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"appBuild\": \"wwwroot/build\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthis is the content of the file, the main entry point is defined and loaded from this file\r\n4. Change the entry point to something like this\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"entryPoints\": {\r\n      \"main\": \"src/another\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"appBuild\": \"wwwroot/build\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. `yarn start`, it should not run, but it does\r\n6. Undo your changes and run `yarn eject`\r\n7. Redo step 4\r\n8. `yarn start` and it should display `multi ./node_modules/react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient.js ./src/another.js`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should display the error without ejecting\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nCustom configuration only works after ejecting\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nCheck Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had any recent activity. If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  According to [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6054#issuecomment-447939583), in order to compile TypeScript with Babel, you need the `isolatedModules` flag. However, this flag is incompatible with the `declaration` flag, which is used to avoid manually duplicated TypeScript type definitions for a library. We have been compiling [`redux-react-hook`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/redux-react-hook) just fine without `isolatedModules`, but every time we run `yarn test` it is added back in and needs to be reverted. Is there a way for emitted declaration files to play nicely with `create-react-app`?\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\u279c yarn --version\r\n1.12.3\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\ntypescript, tsconfig, declaration, isolatedModules\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n\u279c create-react-app --info\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.1\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7920HQ CPU @ 3.10GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.12.3 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 72.0.3626.119\r\n    Safari: 12.0.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.3 => 16.8.3\r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.3 => 16.8.3\r\n    react-scripts: ^2.1.3 => 2.1.3\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. `yarn create react-app cra-tsconfig-bug --typescript`\r\n2. `cd cra-tsconfig-bug`\r\n3. `touch .watchmanconfig`\r\n4.

This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had any recent activity. If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n I assume this isn't getting any traction because when you use babel to compile typescript, as `create-react-app` does, you are supposed to use `isolatedModules`, and `isolatedModules` is not compatible with `declaration`, per https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29490.  I'm interested in contributing to CRA and I was looking over the contributing guidelines. There's no mention of Lerna apart from the fact that this is a monorepo. \r\n\r\n1. Are we dependant on Lerna for development or releasing?\r\n\r\nFrom my limited experience, changes to any of the packages are displayed immediately when using `yarn start` to deploy the example/template in `react-scripts/packages/react-scripts`.\r\nHowever, the init command and changes to create-react-app require you to commit your changes (`yarn run create-react-app`).\r\n\r\n2. Is there a way to develop the init script (`packages/react-scripts/scripts/init.js`) without having to commit your local changes. This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had any recent activity. If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  Perhaps saving another person digging through Google to find [they've missed the little 'X'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46589819/disable-error-overlay-in-development-mode?rq=1) that's been there all along.

Would you like to submit a PR? I experienced the same issue when trying to copy the build directory to test in SharePoint, tildes ~ are not allowed.  And I had to change runtimeChunk to this instead of what was previously mentioned to work, not sure why:\r\n\r\n`    runtimeChunk: {\r\n      name: entrypoint => 'runtime-' + entrypoint.name\r\n    }` This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Wondering if this is going to be implemented soon. There doesn't seem like there are any advantages to a tilde over a dash, and it causes unwanted problems. I'd prefer not to have to change the config for every single app :) https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6710\r\n\r\nSeems like webpack just started it that way, but when questioned about it, didn\u2019t really push back that there was a reason for it. They added the ability to change it in a release soon after. \r\n\r\nWould changing it in the default CRA config have any adverse effects? I can\u2019t think of any.   <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

Why do we exclude that?\r\n\r\n@mrmckeb the socksjs part is there, because the proxy should not proxy the request from the auto reloading server to the other server. So I don't saw another solution to implement it by the path name. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/30ee52cf3b2cbb6ac70999c02b1196bcaba8d4ca/packages/react-scripts/config/webpackDevServer.config.js#L63-L68  This is a work in progress. Do not merge.\r\n\r\nThis has become a little more complicated than I first envisioned. Right now, I'm still working through the init part of this. The plan is as follows:\r\n\r\n- `react-scripts` and `create-react-app-template-*` are installed as dependencies. Either or both of those can be defined via CLI.\r\n  - Default is current default template.\r\n  - Although the supported scripts version (range) is included in the template's `peerDependencies`, this is not used during install.\r\n- Upon `react-scripts` init, the template is copied from template package, and `peerDependencies` are installed from that package (excluding the scripts-version). That package is then removed, as it no longer has any value.\r\n  - When using non-standard scripts, or a scripts version that is below the `peerDependencies` of the template, appropriate warnings will be shown - but the user can still continue. This, importantly, allows custom scripts versions to work with the template.\r\n  - Optionally, the scripts version range could be in engines... but that doesn't feel clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `typescript` flag is deprecated under this process. Would be awesome to have the ability to add custom scripts to the package.json. Say, my template has internationalisation, and I want to add extraction script to the project.

But, together with isolatedModules, this causes problems whenever there are .js files in the codebase. Specifically it causes Microsoft/TypeScript#15230: \"`Cannot compile namespaces when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided.`\"\r\n\r\n.js files can be introduced naturally a number of ways, e.g. by following instructions to add setupTests.js, setupProxy.js, etc., or by tools that generate .js files (e.g. protobuf, pegjs, etc.).\r\n\r\nI think this is not needed because TS is only used for typechecking and not transpilation.  Babel and webpack together already make sure to include any imported/required .js files in the output bundle. This is still an open issue.

After hours of debugging, I have a minimal example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nclass Pimped  {\r\n    pi!: number;\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        Object.setPrototypeOf(this, {\r\n            pi: 3.14\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst p = new Pimped();\r\nconsole.log('p.pi is: ', p.pi);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill print: `p.pi is undefined`. While the correct output would be `p.pi is 3.14`. Invoking typescript manually generates correct javascript, so I'm not really sure what's going wrong here. Perhaps the issue is with babel?\r\n\r\nNote if you remove the type declaration, it actually prints the correct resultt:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Pimped  {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        Object.setPrototypeOf(this, {\r\n            pi: 3.14\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst p = new Pimped();\r\nconsole.log('p.pi is: ', (p as any).pi);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n I have similar issue\r\nthe bundle contains a class constructor with\r\n\r\n`this.someProp = void 0;`\r\n\r\nit cause many exception on my project because it override existing values in `this.someProp`.\r\nmaybe create-react-app using `babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties` ? Yeah, this is the same issue. The code generation is actually doing that `void 0` which changes the behavior compared to what typescript itself would generate Is there a way to disable this behavior?

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n Please provide a minimal repo.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes \r\nThis is a bug report. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\u03bb npm --version\r\n6.8.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWindows, Windows 7, fs-extra\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 7\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU       M 450  @ 2.40GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Yarn: 1.1.0 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 6.7.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.9600.19267\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. npx create-react-app . \r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNormally it install properly the react-app basic set-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible!

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you\u2019re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have the nodejs version the latest 11. Would changing the nodejs to version 10 would be better?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\nI can't skip this. It's the in automatic steps.  I changed Nodejs version. I now have v.10, used to have 11. \r\n\r\nAnd I switched create-react-app version back to 2.1.3. And it does work. \r\n This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had any recent activity. If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue.\n  There is a bug report in #5280 that documents the regression, and there's a potential fix in #5841 that was [closed by the stale bot](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5841#issuecomment-461306706). The bot mentioned \"If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue\" and I have a question: can someone please merge that fix? @jamescostian \r\nuntil this is fixed, I figured out a way to get around it\r\n\r\nif you follow the instructions for \"Configure the Proxy Manually\" here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development#configuring-the-proxy-manually\r\n\r\nthen in the instructions it tells you to create a file src/setupProxy.js\r\n\r\nyou can put in the following\r\n```js\r\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');\r\nconst URI = process.env.REVERSE_PROXY_URI || 'http://localhost:8000'\r\nmodule.exports = function(app) {\r\nconst apiProxy = proxy('/graphql', {target:URI});\r\nconst wsProxy = proxy('/graphql', {ws:true, target:URI});\r\n  app.use(apiProxy);\r\n  app.use(wsProxy);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor production you can use this, some old code I had from 2015 helped me figure this out\r\n```\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\n\r\nvar proxyMiddleware = require('http-proxy-middleware');\r\n\r\nvar server = process.env.SERVER || 'localhost'\r\n\r\nvar apiproxy = proxyMiddleware('/graphql', { pathRewrite: { '^/graphql' : 'graphql' }, target:'http://'+server+':8000'});\r\nvar wsproxy = proxyMiddleware('/graphql', {ws:true, target:'http://'+server+':8000'});\r\n\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\napp.use(apiproxy); // the order here is important\r\napp.use(wsproxy);\r\napp.use(express.static('./'));\r\n\r\napp.listen(9000, function () {\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n Hi, I have tried the above, while I still have the following problem:\r\n\r\nThe front-end is making http request to the port itself, instead of the backend port.\r\n\r\nSetting: \r\nFront-end port: 3000\r\nBack-end port:8080\r\n\r\nWhat I put in the setupProxy.js:\r\n```\r\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');\r\n\r\nconst URI = process.env.REVERSE_PROXY_URI || 'http://localhost:8080'\r\nmodule.exports = function(app) {\r\nconst merchantProxy = proxy('/merchant/', {target:URI});\r\n  app.use(merchantProxy);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way I am doing request:\r\n```\r\nfetch('/merchant/')\r\n      .then(res => console.log(res)) \r\n```\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\nHeader.js:138 GET http://localhost:3000/merchant/ 404 (Not Found)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I force it to use my backend port for fetching? You already have forced it to use your backend port for fetching, and your backend is sending the 404. For example, try `curl -v localhost:3000/this-does-not-exist` and notice that the server responds with a 200 - that's because the dev server always responds with 200s, thinking that you have the frontend in charge of routing. The fact that you're getting a 404 means that you aren't talking to the dev server anymore, you're talking to your own server. You can also try `curl -v localhost:8080/merchant/` to confirm this. I have tested sending GET request to backend `localhost:8080/merchant/` and it works properly.\r\n\r\nAccording to the error message `\"GET http://localhost:3000/merchant/ 404 (Not Found)\"`, it's trying to send GET request to `localhost:3000/merchant/` instead of sending GET request `localhost:8080/merchant/`, which also explains the reason why there is a page not found. \r\n\r\nSo I think it looks like `const merchantProxy = proxy('/merchant/', {target:URI});` is not working. But that message is coming from the frontend, right? The frontend is talking to `localhost:3000`, but the dev server listening on `localhost:3000` is forwarding to `localhost:8080`. That's why the frontend says `localhost:3000`, because it doesn't know that the request is being forwarded. And your code in `setupProxy.js` looks perfect, I have basically the exact same code and it works perfectly for me.\r\n\r\nHere's another example. Change your frontend code to `fetch('/does-not-exist/').then(res => console.log(res))`. You won't get a 404 error, you'll get a 200. Why do you get a 200 when that doesn't exist? Because it's not being proxied. But when you `fetch('/merchant/').then(res => console.log(res))` you get a 404. Why do you get a 404? Because it *is* being proxied to `localhost:8080`. Just make this test and you'll see what I mean. You could try `console.log(URI)` and make sure that your URI isn't being overridden by an environment variable called `REVERSE_PROXY_URI`, but other than that I don't have any pointers beyond \"it's your backend, not your frontend or the proxy, that's giving you the 404\"\r\n\r\nEDIT: one idea I have is it could be an INSANELY specific bug (e.g. the backend is 404ing because your frontend user has certain cookies, or because you have a certain Referrer header, etc.). Try going to the network tab on Chrome after your frontend makes the request to `/merchant/`, and right-click on the request to `/merchant/` and copy it as a cURL command. You can then paste that into your terminal and change the port from 3000 to 8080, and see what happens. Thank you very much for your detailed explanation! I have understand now and the problem has been solved! \r\n\r\nIt's because that the request path is not correct. Just double check if the proxy path is consistent with your backend path, should be fine!\r\n Ok  Please bear with me, this is not one of those \"please implement namespaces\".\r\n\r\nI already reported a related issue #5633 when the TypeScript support got out and did not really found a satisfactory answer so I've postponed it for later. I am using `react-scripts-ts` which works, but there is a huge price in terms of setting up other relevant tools. Two production apps and after 10 months of development we had no need to eject. I would love to switch over to CRA to simplify setup for other apps.\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\nThe [Whatsup clone app](https://github.com/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-Client-React) came to the light recently and upon closer inspection, I've noticed they are using pretty much similar setup to ours except there is `react-scripts` and it works along with namespaces present and generated by very same `graphql-code-generator` package.\r\n\r\nLong story short, if namespaces only are used, it's perfectly fine and the application runs even though they are not supported \ud83d\ude2e But, if there are also enums in the same file which are used within the app code, things get broken. The Whatsup client app does have a single enum generated (`MessageType`), but they don't use it anywhere in there code and that's why it's working \ud83d\ude35\r\n\r\nMy guess is, that there two stages in a compilation. The first one just strips types so it's not worried about namespaces at all. However, when there is an enum (which has runtime counterpart), some other piece of tooling probably reads that generated file again and that's where it sees namespaces and cannot live with that. It fails compilation with usual \"Namespaces are not supported\".\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\nI've prepared a simple demo repository that shows the problem: https://github.com/FredyC/cra-typescript-enums\r\nJust install deps and `yarn start` and it works even though there is namespace used in the `index.tsx`. Uncomment the line I've marked there to see the issue.\r\n\r\n### Solution 1\r\nThe easiest would definitely be if namespaces can \"simply\" be ignored in the build step even though there are enums used in runtime from the same file. You don't really need namespaces in runtime (unless there are enums inside \ud83d\ude16)\r\n\r\n### Solution 2\r\nHave enums and namespaces in separate files. I've confirmed this solution in the demo app and its working. However, I would have to somehow tweak the generator to do the separation.\r\n\r\n### Solution 3\r\nUse `.d.ts` file. @Timer has [suggested that](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5633#issuecomment-434454624) and I would actually like now. But, enums are giving a hard time again. They cannot be in `.d.ts` part as they would missing in a runtime. So it's pretty much the same as Solution 2.\r\n\r\n### Solution 4\r\nGet rid of namespaces. Yea, I know, they are obsolete and blah blah...But I don't like any other variant without them so far.\r\n\r\n### Solution 5?\r\nI don't have one, please suggest.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nIf no viable solution comes from this, it's confusing at best that namespace are not supported, but in fact they kinda are... Ok, I've actually found the **Solution 5** which is the one I like :) [More details](https://github.com/Urigo/WhatsApp-Clone-Client-React/issues/61#issuecomment-466562044) if anyone is interested.\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue is still kinda about better communicating that namespaces can be used for type checking as long as there are no enums in the same file. If you don't agree, feel free to close. Ok sure, I am closing it if you insist :) Hopefully it will help someone someday :)  I have a Java Spring Boot backend running as my API server which has CORS disabled and CSRF protection enabled. I have stand-alone single page React app has following proxy setting in the package.json which route my API request to the proxy server.\r\n\r\n` \"proxy\": \"http://localhost:51051\",`\r\n\r\nStart my app with\r\n `npm start ` \r\nMy app running as expected. I can get XSRF-TOKEN cookie set by the backend server. I use that CSRF token to send a post request the API server.\r\n\r\nFor a production build, I add the full API server URL with each path with the help of environment variable like below.\r\n\r\n`REACT_APP_API_BASE=http://localhost:51051/ npm run build` \r\n\r\nNow I run the application with \r\n\r\n`serve -s build`\r\n\r\nApplication running and access from http://localhost:5000/\r\n\r\nNow the problem is I don't get the XSRF-TOKEN cookie set by the backend server. Hence the server rejects my request with 401 error. I tried to set Cookie manually as suggested [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/36468/csrf-protection-and-single-page-apps) \r\nStill, server rejecting my post request with 401.\r\n\r\nAppreciate if anybody has a good solution for this.\r\n  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes \r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

Is there a way to get them replaced or reference them like in the bundles?  We are planning to release Create React App version 3.0 soon. This will be a relatively small release but will include a number of necessary breaking changes.\r\n\r\n## Planned Features\r\n* Jest 24: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6278\r\n* Hooks ESLint plugin: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5997\r\n* TypeScript ESLint plugin https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6513\r\n* Add browserslist support to @babel/preset-env: #6608\r\n* Absolute imports using `jsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.json`: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6656\r\n\r\n## Nice to Have Features\r\n* babel-plugin-optimize-react: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6219\r\n\r\nRefer to the [3.0 Milestone](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/milestone/58?closed=1) to see exactly what is included in this release.\r\n\r\n## \u2622\ufe0f How Can I Test This Now? \u2622\ufe0f \r\n\r\nWe're happy you'd like to test the next version of `react-scripts`! Before getting into the details, we'd like to make you aware of a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Features may be broken or not work as expected\r\n1. There will be more breaking changes introduced before the final release \u26a0\ufe0f \r\n1. Documentation for new features is still sparse, so look through the pull requests for how they're expected to work\r\n\r\nYou can install the latest alpha version of `react-scripts` using one of the following commands:\r\n```bash\r\n$ # Create a new application\r\n$ npx create-react-app@next --scripts-version=3.0.0-next.68 app-name\r\n$ # Upgrade an existing application\r\n$ yarn upgrade react-scripts@3.0.0-next.68\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrading from 2.0 to 3.0\r\n\r\n* The `browserslist` config in your `package.json` is now used to control the output of your JavaScript files. You can use separate configuration for `development` and `production`. See https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/b0cbf2caa18ee8267855b14578ebc3dee826f552/packages/react-scripts/package.json#L83-L94 for a good starting point which gives a good development experience, especially when using language features such as async/await, but still provides high compatibility with many browsers in production\r\n\r\n* We now have linting support for TypeScript files! If you're using Visual Studio Code, see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/setting-up-your-editor.md#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor for tips to get syntax highlighting from the ESLint extension in your `.ts` and `.tsx` files\r\n\r\n* We now support setting `basePath` in `jsconfig.json`. To configure `basePath` to point to the `src` directory create a `jsconfig.json` file in your project root:\r\n\r\n\t```json\r\n\t{\r\n\t  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n\t    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n## Known Issues in 3.0 Alphas\r\n\r\n* ~~File watching issue with Jest 24: #6646~~\r\n* Dynamic imports may not work in some cases: #6673\r\n\r\n**Please report any bugs you encounter or behavior you believe to be incorrect by creating a new issue. Have fun!**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nSo you want to cut a new alpha?\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm run publish -- premajor --canary --preid next --dist-tag next --npm-client npm --force-publish\r\n--> Not sure if it is a good place to ask, but.. could you share your intentions regarding RHL support? Can we expect it to be supported out of the box? ### It would be nice if these two css features get included too:\r\n- Support scoped CSS in the same file (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5224)\r\n- CSS Modules with TypeScript: css-modules-typescript-loader (#5677)\r\n\r\n @miraage I do not have any information to share about hot loader support.\r\n\r\n@amshtemp Both of those issues are just proposals with no PR so it's very unlikely they will be included.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a small release because we need to upgrade Jest due to the security issue with Jest 23. Once this is out we will immediately start work on version 4.0 so it's possible these features could be included then. @amshtemp, as previously stated on #5677, we aren't planning to add anything like that for now as it's not a good DX. We do want a solution, we just need the right one. Regrading the Typescript aliases (#6116) could the team give a little bit more details about how you would like this to work? There are still some questions/inconsistencies that I need some clarity on before I can continue working on the aliases part.  With hooks, it seems like class-based components will be used less and less. Should the default App component be function-based? (references #6451) @cassiozen Yes, we will want to convert the template component to a function for v3. I'll add that to the list. love it! Any thoughts about supporting webpackPrefetch? Load PostCSS config file from project root directory if exists ?  Search available port to start webpack dev server if port is not specified in env @iansu I saw that #6280 was moved to milestone 3 - does that mean that it will be part of this release? @iansu I've created a new PR (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6656) for `baseUrl` support in favor of #6116 so we can hopefully get that in with 3.0 @iansu why 3.0 add ability to configure PostCSS plugins ?\r\nplease have a look into this if possible https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6649 It seems that React @Types are not installed by using --typescript flag.\r\n\r\nnpx create-react-app@next --scripts-version=3.0.0-next.b0cbf2ca my-app --typescript Is v3.1.0 also available for testing?  > Is v3.1.0 also available for testing?\r\n\r\nI also got confused, there are some weird tags for `v3.0.0` and `v3.1.0` from sep 2018:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.1.0\r\n\r\nThese versions are not published in npm. I guess someone should delete these above. :thinking:  CRA3 seems (so far) to have support for TypeScript v 3.4.1, for anyone wondering. CRA2 would break on new TS syntax (`as const`, `readonly` on array return types, \u2026). Any approximate timeline for the release of 3.0? @TomasHubelbauer It's enough to update the indirect dependencies @babel/parser and @babel/plugin-transform-typescript to >= 7.4.0. This allows to use TS 3.4 in CRA 2.1.8. I noticed a 2-3x slowdown when using TypeScript with Storybook v5. ~9s to ~30s. updates on when this is going to be released? > I noticed a 2-3x slowdown when using TypeScript with Storybook v5. ~9s to ~30s.\r\n\r\nI can confirm this. Transpilation time has massively increased, both for `yarn build` and `yarn start` This transpilation performance is probably due to https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30663#issuecomment-480437597 - It seems like with typescript@next it's already solved by that comment. @voliva Even with `typescript@next` I'm still getting slow storybooks. We've just published a new alpha release of Create React App 3.0! This issue has been updated with instructions on testing the new release. If you encounter any problems please create a new issue instead of commenting here.\r\n\r\n#### Notable changes since the last alpha\r\n\r\n* Add support for baseUrl in jsconfig.json (#6656)\r\n* Update to core-js 3 (#6769)\r\n* Upgrade to workbox-webpack-plugin v4 (#6725)\r\n* Enable futureEmitAssets setting in webpack config (#6696)\r\n* Fix terser causing build to hang on WSL (#6732)\r\n* Add PostCSS Normalize (#5810)\r\n\r\nRefer to the [3.0 Milestone](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/milestone/58?closed=1) to see exactly what is included in this release. @iansu \r\n\r\nNot sure where the best place to open an issue is for an alpha build, but I noticed strange behavior after updating to latest alpha trying my test coverage script. Instead of running a coverage report it seems to be entering watch mode.\r\n\r\nHere is a reproducible repo. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jkdowdle/creact-react-app-3.0.0-next.68-test-coverage-issue\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```npx create-react-app@next --scripts-version=3.0.0-next.68 app-name && cd $_ && yarn test --coverage``` @jkdowdle Please file this as a new issue so we can track it properly. I read the \u201cNice to Have Features\u201d for the 3.0 release, and was wondering whether these PR\u2019s qualify:\r\n- Simple electron.js support #5498\r\n- Webworker support #3660, please see the updated version #5886 @jlarmstrongiv I don't think either of those features are going to make it into 3.0 but they're not breaking changes so we can include them in a 3.x release. `jsconfig.json` is not a good idea. The filename implies that it is somehow a standard JS thing, when it is actually a CRA specific thing. `tsconfig.json` IS a TypeScript standard thing, since it comes from the sole vendor of the TypeScript language. However, JavaScript is a standard from multiple vendors, and publishing a config file that implies that it is related to that standard will cause confusion when people switch between tools.\r\n\r\nI would suggest renaming this file to `craconfig.json` or something similar, or maybe adding a `cra` key in `package.json` for this config. Yeah, Dan already corrected me on Twitter. Even so, I don\u2019t think propagating that config file further outside of VSCode is a good idea for the same reasons.\r\n @devongovett, as @ianschmitz said we're definitely open for discussion in an issue :)\r\n\r\n`jsconfig.json` is quite powerful, and users in IDEs making use of the TypeScript service will benefit from this.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, your concern is more that you'd like to see a config file for `create-react-app`. This is something we've discussed a few times, and we're definitely look at ways to make `create-react-app` more flexible for different users. Very excited about CRA 3.0 especially about the eslint-hooks plugin \ud83c\udf89\r\nCould we also add https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6599 to 3.0? It feels like full lerna support is one of the most requested features of the community.  I don't really mind if there is or isn't a CRA specific config, I am mostly concerned with propagating a non-standard config masquerading as a standard one. It will cause confusion for people using other tools that support JavaScript but do not support this config file. We can specifically mention that in the documentation. But a standard needs to start somewhere, vscode has a huge user base and these users will benefit from a configuration that keeps their IDE and build tool in sync with things like auto completion. Having our own configuration file will not do that.  Again, feel free to open an issue to discuss this further @devongovett. What are the breaking changes? Any chance we see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6280 making it in? Suppose its more under the nice to have. But PR seems ready and opens up a bit of possibilities when running multiple CRA apps locally  We just published Create React App 3.0! See the [release notes](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for details about everything that's included and instructions on upgrading your apps.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to everyone who contributed to this release and helped test the alphas! \ud83c\udf89   <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\nSupport a new environment variable `TERSER_CONFIG`. A dev could set it to a JSON with [config values supported by Terser](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#terseroptions) and CRA would merge default this JSON with its default Terser config.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n1. Set `TERSER_CONFIG` to `{ \"keep_classnames\": true }`\r\n1. `keep_classnames` set to `true` added to [Terser options](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/6a5b3cdaaa7e9ee2cae358a50cf005af9d1408bd/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L187)\r\n\r\n**Reasoning:**\r\nCertain libraries rely on class names which are minified by default by Terser. It would be nice to change that without maintaining a fork of CRA for one line of code only.\r\nI'm pretty sure there're other cases as well. Anyway it's pretty simple to add this, it would give developers more freedom, so what's the harm, right? :)\r\n\r\n**Implementation considerations:**\r\nIf `TERSER_CONFIG` environment variable is present, do `JSON.parse` of its value and add it to Terser options [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/6a5b3cdaaa7e9ee2cae358a50cf005af9d1408bd/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L187). Add `TERSER_CONFIG` to [this list](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).\r\n\r\n*Would you be willing to accept a PR for this functionality?* @gaearon @Timer @iansu @ianschmitz  any thoughts? Would you be willing to merge a PR for this feature if I come up with one?  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nno\r\n\r\nstandard .gitignore looks like this: \r\n```\r\n# dependencies\r\n/node_modules\r\n/.pnp\r\n.pnp.js\r\n\r\n# testing\r\n/coverage\r\n\r\n# production\r\n/build\r\n\r\n# misc\r\n.DS_Store\r\n.env.local\r\n.env.development.local\r\n.env.test.local\r\n.env.production.local\r\n\r\nnpm-debug.log*\r\nyarn-debug.log*\r\nyarn-error.log*\r\n\r\n```\r\nI want to add ./idea, .vscode/ and shrinkwrap.yaml. the problem is create react app make `git add . ` before it, so I have to delete .git and run git init again.

Not entirely sure what you mean by CRA make `git add .`? > Shouldnt have to run `git init` again, just add the folders you want ignored. Not entirely sure what you mean by CRA make `git add .`?\r\n\r\nin that case the folder is steel in git.  Add the folders you want to the project and then add them to head in git. Git should acknowledge all hidden files and folders if they are not ignored already via gitignore. Have you already set your own remote origin to git?  Hello! First of all, I would like to say that I'm not positive that this issue is caused by `react-scripts`. It might be an issue in `babel-loader`, in the module `typesafe-actions`, or even in `typescript` itself!\r\n\r\nBut I didn't know how to determine where to start, and I think that it's reasonable to open the issue here.\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nThis issue is not related to anything in the Troubleshooting guide.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.15 Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 8.12.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v8.12.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v8.12.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Firefox: 65.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.2 => 16.8.2 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.2 => 16.8.2 \r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.5 => 2.1.5 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to creating a type alias and using it.\r\n\r\nWhen I develop with `redux` and `typesafe-actions`, I spotted a common pattern:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// actions.ts\r\nimport { createStandardAction } from \"typesafe-actions\";\r\n\r\nexport interface MyActionPayload {\r\n    foo: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst myAction = createStandardAction()<MyActionPayload>(\"MY_ACTION\");\r\n\r\n// MyComponent.tsx\r\nimport { MyActionPayload } from \"./actions\";\r\n\r\ninterface DispatchProps {\r\n    performMyAction: (payload: MyActionPayload) => void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I decided to abstract it to:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// actions.ts\r\nimport { createStandardAction } from \"typesafe-actions\";\r\n\r\nexport interface MyActionPayload {\r\n    foo: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst myAction = createStandardAction()<MyActionPayload>(\"MY_ACTION\");\r\n\r\n// MyComponent.tsx\r\nimport { myAction } from \"./actions\";\r\nimport { Dispatcher } from \"./Dispatcher\";\r\n\r\ninterface DispatchProps {\r\n    performMyAction: Dispatcher<typeof myAction>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Dispatcher.ts\r\nimport { ActionType } from \"typesafe-actions\";\r\n\r\nexport type Dispatcher<T> = (payload: ActionType<T>[\"payload\"]) => void;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason this does not work. The dev server gets stuck on `Starting the development server...` forever. However, if we inline `Dispatcher` it does work as expected.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// actions.ts\r\nimport { createStandardAction } from \"typesafe-actions\";\r\n\r\nexport interface MyActionPayload {\r\n    foo: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst myAction = createStandardAction()<MyActionPayload>(\"MY_ACTION\");\r\n\r\n// MyComponent.tsx\r\nimport { myAction } from \"./actions\";\r\n\r\ninterface DispatchProps {\r\n    performMyAction: (payload: ActionType<typeof myAction>[\"payload\"]) => void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no Typescript error, the server is just stuck. I have set up a [demo repo](https://github.com/MeLlamoPablo/dev-server-bug-test-repo); in order to reproduce the bug just do:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/MeLlamoPablo/dev-server-bug-test-repo\r\n$ cd dev-server-bug-test-repo\r\n$ yarn\r\n$ yarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the repo's `README.md` says, you can find the working version in the `working` branch.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your help!\r\n I have updated the dependencies in the demo repo:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/package.json b/package.json\r\nindex 4981861..8eb25a4 100644\r\n--- a/package.json\r\n+++ b/package.json\r\n@@ -3,17 +3,17 @@\r\n   \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n   \"private\": true,\r\n   \"dependencies\": {\r\n-    \"@types/jest\": \"24.0.6\",\r\n-    \"@types/node\": \"11.9.4\",\r\n-    \"@types/react\": \"16.8.4\",\r\n+    \"@types/jest\": \"24.0.11\",\r\n+    \"@types/node\": \"11.11.3\",\r\n+    \"@types/react\": \"16.8.8\",\r\n     \"@types/react-dom\": \"16.8.2\",\r\n     \"react\": \"^16.8.2\",\r\n     \"react-dom\": \"^16.8.2\",\r\n     \"react-redux\": \"^6.0.1\",\r\n-    \"react-scripts\": \"2.1.5\",\r\n+    \"react-scripts\": \"2.1.8\",\r\n     \"redux\": \"^4.0.1\",\r\n     \"typesafe-actions\": \"^3.1.0\",\r\n-    \"typescript\": \"3.3.3\"\r\n+    \"typescript\": \"3.3.3333\"\r\n   },\r\n   \"scripts\": {\r\n     \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug is still happening, but now it is getting stuck on `Files successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results...`, which leads me to think that this is an issue in `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`. Any new insights on this? I recently upgraded packages and now experiencing this same \"Files successfully emitted, waiting for typecheck results...\" message and horridly long build times that tax the proc. The problem occurs with TypeScript 3.4.1 and rolling back to TypeScript 3.3.3333 resolves the issue. It may be related to the new incremental build option..?? This issue appears narrow in on the root cause, a conflict between Typescript 3.4.1 and styled-components@4.2.0:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft/TypeScript#30663 This issue was just resolved and should be closed.

I would like to propose that instead of renaming existing `README.md` to `README.old.md` if any, CRA should instead leave that file alone and drop its readme under the name `README-CRA.md` and not `README.md`.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this is that if a readme exists already, it's most likely going to be more valuable than the CRA readme and that's what people should keep seeing after CRA is scaffolded in the repository. It's still handy to have the CRA readme handy, but no one is going to start rebuilding their existing readme on top the CRA one, they will just reference bits of the CRA one in their own.\r\n\r\nSo instead of forcing people to rename the CRA readme and fixing the incorrect rename of their already existing readme, let's create the CRA readme under a new name and respect the exsting readme. I just found that CRA will warn and refuse to run in case a `README2.md` file already exists in the destination directory, so on top of touching the user's file unexpectedly, any users who are aware of this behavior and try to avoid it by naming their readme in a non-conflicting way will actually be punished for that. CRA doesn't generate a `README2.md` file so it is unclear to me what that is disallowed from existing while actual conflicting `README.md` isn't.

No this is when doing \"create-react-app .\". It asks you to clear your directory if it has any files. But if it has just a README it renames it instead.

I've just started to play around with this https://github.com/thomashorrobin/create-react-app-rust `create-react-app` fork that adds rust support. I had some problems with typescript using it and decide to `rebase` on top of the latest `create-react-app` to not waste time debugging for something that's already fixed here. While doing this I realised that the actual changes for rust seem minimal. I'm not sure if there was ever a discussion about folding this fork into this project. I couldn't find anything in the issues to that extent. \r\n\r\nMy question is: would it be of interest to include Rust (via WASM) support in this package directly, or maintain the separate fork? If there's interest I can `rebase` again and prepare the fork to be submitted as a PR. Thanks! Hi @bowd!\r\n\r\nDoes the `rust` support require changes to the `react-scripts` or other internal tools or does it just change the scaffolding and add the relevant dependencies and build scripts? No major changes as far as I can see what we're looking at is just some webpack loaders, some build script changes and scaffolding. I would modify the scaffolding to work similarly to the `--typescript` flag and the build based on detecting the `Cargo.toml` file. I will need to understand the changes made in that fork better and make sure I agree with all of them, and add tests of course.  Not to co-opt this thread but for posterity, I wrote about a solution to this using react-app-rewired: https://prestonrichey.com/blog/react-rust-wasm/. Obviously vanilla CRA support for Wasm would be great but this might be a resource for others playing around in this space in the meantime.  @prichey I've tried your way but I get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n../webassembly-tests-rust/pkg/webassembly_tests_rust_bg.wasm\r\nModule parse failed: Unexpected section: 0xfe\r\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.\r\nError: Unexpected section: 0xfe\r\n```\r\nAny advice? I found this issue https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8781 but I have no way to upgrade webpack, I think.  @ponchofiesta Did you set your `wasm-bindgen` version as specified here? https://github.com/rustwasm/book/issues/148#issuecomment-463809784 Now it works. Great solution! I get the same error message, even with explicitly setting wasm-bindgen version :( At the same time, ejecting the CRA would cause a flurry of other different problems, so I guess I need to wait until there is a more 'mainstream' option for rust->wasm->CRA\r\n\r\nkeep up the good work guys! This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n I'm really not sure is a good fit for CRA. Note that this is different than #4912, which is just asking for wasm support, whereas this is using [rust-native-wasm-loader](https://github.com/dflemstr/rust-native-wasm-loader) to have webpack actually compile rust code into wasm. IMO that's pretty niche.  Fixes #6038 \r\n\r\nVerified fix correctly detects windows7 and triggers file copy of babel.config.js into the root directory of the cra.  Ran the same code on a Mac OS, and it correctly wrote the default babel configuration setup into the package.json file.\r\n Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

If you have a question or comment, please open a new issue. Thank you for your contribution!\n  I would like to propose that `.gitignore` gets created at the same time `README.md` and `package.json` do. Right now from experimentation it seems like the two do get created first, then `npm install` is run and then a bunch of other files including `.gitignore` gets dropped into the directory.\r\n\r\nThere's probably a reason for that, maybe the `.gitignore` gets copied from the scripts package, I don't know, but still, maybe an interim `.gitignore` could be created which ignores `node_modules`?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask for this is because when I run `create-react-app .` (create in the current directory) in the VS Code Terminal, VS Code tries to calculate changes at npm-install-time and often runs into the too may changes state, which is a wasted effort ultimately, because at the end of the CRA creation, the Git ignore file gets dropped and the resulting set of changes is correct.\r\n\r\nProviding the Git ignore file upfront (before `npm install`) or providing an interim one to be replaced by the filed one would solve this issue and make the experience a bit nicer. My proposal still stands.

Open terminal\r\n2. `create-react-app --typescript project-name`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCreate a react app with typescript support\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nGet error: error: unkown option `typescript'\r\n(funny sidenote: the word typescript has missmatched quotes :smile:  )\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n[asciinema demo](https://asciinema.org/a/IrjBaVw2DFWrgFFxL92t4y4RZ)\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nSeems to relate to [5853](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5853)\r\n Does `create-react-app --help` contain a `--typescript` option? Yes it does for me. That's what was baffling me the most.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\nDunno whether it's relevant to my problem but i'm not on OSX but Ubuntu. However I can't imagine this being the reason for my issue. Quick update:\r\n`create-react-app --typescript -- project-name` (note the extra dashes) works!\r\n\r\nMight be an issue with `commander`.\r\nI looked into the sources of `createReactApp.js` and it looked fine to me.\r\nI'll check commander next and try to reproduce this buggy behavior with a bare-bones example.\r\n\r\nThanks for the efford @miraage  Hi,\r\n\r\njust to be sure, does this happen if the `--typescript` flag is passed after the project-name as in the [docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/adding-typescript.md)? Hey @petetnt \r\nGood call! Project generator works just fine if the arguments are in the order you and the docs describe.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. create a new CRA project\r\n2. add this script in your index.html : \r\n```html\r\n<script>\r\n    var isProduction = '%NODE_ENV%' === 'production'\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n3. run `yarn build`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nExpect index.html output : \r\n```html\r\n<!-- content before -->\r\n<script>var isProduction = !0</script>\r\n<!-- content after -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nActual index.html output : \r\n```html\r\n<!-- content before -->\r\n<script>var isProduction = !1</script>\r\n<!-- content after -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why it happens ?\r\n\r\nThe bug is due to wrong event/hook selection in [InterpolateHtmlPlugin](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-dev-utils/InterpolateHtmlPlugin.js#L29).\r\n\r\nWith [beforeEmit event](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#beforeemit-hook), The uglification of javascript in the index.html is done before the replacement of environment variables, so step by step we have :\r\n\r\n1.  raw js\r\n```js\r\nvar env = '%NODE_ENV%'\r\nvar isProduction = '%NODE_ENV%' === 'production' \r\n```\r\n2. uglify (+ compress)\r\n```js\r\nvar env='%NODE_ENV%'\r\nvar isProduction=!1\r\n```\r\n3. replace env var\r\n```js\r\nvar env='production'\r\nvar isProduction=!1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to fix ?\r\n\r\nIn html-webpack-plugin, html minification (and js uglify) is done via [html-minifier](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/blob/master/index.js#L433-L444) just after the [afterTemplateExecution](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/blob/master/index.js#L271-L274).\r\n\r\nSo we need to use the [afterTemplateExecution event](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#aftertemplateexecution-hook) to replace env vars before uglify.\r\nIt's the first time where we [have the html output](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events), so It seams to be more relevant to replace env vars in the html with this hook.\r\n\r\n Same issue was reported earlier - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5473 What about the following example:\r\n```html\r\n<% if (\"%NODE_ENV%\" === \"production\") { %>\r\n<script>\r\n  console.log('it works!');\r\n</script>\r\n<% } %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `InterpolateHtmlPlugin` applied `afterTemplateExecution` this placeholder would not be replaced.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to run this plugin before any processing so it will work? Or maybe a better solution would be to pass ENV variables as options to `HtmlWebpackPlugin`, so [they can be used during template execution](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#writing-your-own-templates)? @olessavluk,\r\n\r\nThis placeholder is not officially support by documentation.\r\nMoreover, look at this issue : #4202 @GuiHash yes, this is what I am looking for. Thanks for pointing this issue! \r\n\r\nHowever, I think it can be done without breaking changes (no need to change the file extension, and syntax right now). I will create separate issue & probably PR with proper description  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-dev-utils/inquirer.js this is the replacement for prompt.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @bugzpodder in https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6026#issuecomment-446507470_ > https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-dev-utils/inquirer.js this is the replacement for prompt.\r\n> \r\n> _Originally posted by @bugzpodder in [#6026 (comment)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6026#issuecomment-446507470)_\r\n\r\nWhat to do with this ?\r\n\r\n**`Error: Cannot find module 'react-dev-utils/prompt'`** **`D:\\dbz-ui-framework-master\\node_modules\\react-dev-utils/inquirer.js`** to **D:\\dbz-ui-framework-master\\node_modules\\react-dev-utils/prompt.js ?** Please fill out the issue template so we can know what version of Create React App and react-dev-utils you're using.  I'm trying to implement a strong CSP for my webapp, and the last remaining item is to remove all `unsafe-inline` directives. I've been able to remove all inline scripts thanks to #5354, but I still have generated css rules being injected into index.html. These rules are specified using the `withStyles` component in Material UI, though my very limited understanding is telling me that this may not necessarily matter (please correct me if this is wrong).\r\n\r\nHow can I disable inlining of css rules so that they're loaded from a separate, generated css file? Does anyone have some thoughts on this? It would be great to be able to disallow `unsafe-inline` styles. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI don't think this step is necessary, due to the error being present in a brand new project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.3\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4278U CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.0 - /usr/local/opt/node@10/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - /usr/local/opt/node@10/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 72.0.3626.109\r\n    Firefox: 65.0\r\n    Safari: 12.0.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.2 => 16.8.2 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.2 => 16.8.2 \r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.5 => 2.1.5 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn\u2019t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. `yarn create react-app my-app`\r\n2. `cd my-app/`\r\n3. `yarn audit`\r\n\r\nIn addition, I've tried to add braces as a top-level dependency using `yarn add braces`.

Unless jest releases a new 23.x version with updated dependencies to micromatch@3 (unlikely since this is a breaking change), or CRA updates to jest 24, I don't think there is an easy workaround for this issue. https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7917\r\n\r\nAs it stands right now, Jest is not planning on releasing a patch for v23. See #6064 #6109 #5777 #5618 for earlier times something like this happened; I think it's useful to draw the connection between these recurring issues.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6064#issuecomment-451521588 explains the reasoning behind this project's tradeoff between dependency pessimism (pinning, delayed upgrades, and enduser frustration) and dependency optimism (allow users to use `npm audit fix` to apply upgrades with `^` or `~`, but remain exposed to the risk that a nested dependency might push a patch upgrade that contains a hidden bug) and give readers of this current issue a pointer to previous discussions and explanations.\r\n\r\nI do see that in this case, Jest fixed the issue with a major version bump, not a patch, so even a SemVer \"minors and patches OK\" `\"babel-jest\": \"^23.6.0\"` wouldn't have helped this time; `>=23.6.0` would but that's probably too optimistic (even for me :-) ).\r\n\r\n> This is a development only package and it should not affect your production build in anyway. \r\n\r\n@bugzpodder That is a very confident prediction! Unfortunately, in fact, I can't push to production via my CI pipeline when my tests fail, and this problem causes `react-scripts test` to fail (since my React client directory is nested under a project root directory containing a NodeJS server, and the server's dependencies are unpinned, so the server got Jest 24.x smoothly via `npm audit fix`). We're not in active release mode right now, so I'm not personally affected by this particular glitch, but I'm confident there are others who are. \r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** For my nested-node-project setup, I had to add `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` to a `.env` file _in the child project dir_ to allow Jest 23.6.0 in the client to peacefully coexist with Jest 24.1.0 in the server. \r\n\r\n**ALSO:** I know open source development can be a thankless task, so **BIG THANKS** to everyone who's working on all these interrelated projects and the tangled dependency webs they weave. \r\n FWIW we originally bumped Micromatch in a minor of Jest 23, but it broke a ton of setups (notably on windows), so we reverted it: https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/6661 @alexch, your production build (i.e. running react-scripts build) will not be affected by this security vulnerability in any way.  You'll get a notice about this low risk vulnerability if you run npm install, but otherwise an end user should not be affected by this issue.  There is no need to rush upgrading to Jest 24. This is causing issues with us being able to deploy our front-end through our CI also. Going to keep an eye out here for any movement. :) Nothing will happen here unless a patch is released for an old version of micromatch or a new major of CRA is released. Using a newer major of micromatch is a breaking change.\r\n\r\nSeems like your CI should just check production dependencies, not dev deps. Doesn't seem like `npm` supports it, though \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \r\n\r\nhttps://npm.community/t/please-support-production-or-only-production-in-npm-audit/3005\r\nhttps://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/18 WORKAROUND\r\n\r\n`npm audit --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org --parseable | wc -l` \r\nreturns the number of vulnerabilities found\r\n\r\nyou can exclude low vulnerabilities with  \r\n`npm audit --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org --parseable | grep -V https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/786 | wc -l`\r\n Instead of using a workaround (which ignores the advisory in all modules you installed) you can use https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-audit-resolver that wraps audit in fine-grained tools to manage your security decision @bugzpodder \r\n> This is a development only package and it should not affect your production build in anyway. It should go away once a newer version of a downstream package that addresses this issue is available.\r\n\r\nI've seen messages like this a number of times for a variety of reported security vulnerabilities in various packages and it's not a particularly satisfying response for me but maybe I'm thinking about things the wrong way. \r\n\r\nIs the expected flow: \r\n- see reported security vulnerability in npm (or yarn).\r\n- lookup that flow\r\n- attempt to determine if the vulnerability will impact the product env or not\r\n- if it's determined it won't, come up with some workaround that suppresses that message from the log\r\n- if it's determined it will, post a bug\r\n\r\nThat flow seems really likely to allow something that wasn't expected to cause a production issue to end up causing one.\r\n\r\nI had been operating under the expectation that the flow was:\r\n- see reported security vulnerability\r\n- immediately attempt to implement a fix - without worrying about whether or not it was expected to cause a prod issue.\r\n- end of flow\r\n\r\nUnder that flow, we're less likely to let flaws creep into our projects but it means responses like \"it only impacts dev\" or \"it's only a command-line thing\" are insufficient.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue with with npm and yarn?  Maybe they should have some sort of \"dev only, prod and dev\" flags or \"mark as 'ok for me and don't tell me again'\" like other vuln scanners have? @bugzpodder If `react-scripts build` were my entire process for doing a production build, I would agree with you. But my process for development and deployment also includes running a suite of unit and acceptance tests; to make them work I need to disable preflight checks... which is fine temporarily, but that allows other dependency issues to creep in, and is also one more thing to remember to undo later.\r\n\r\n@jdalegonzalez I think you're right that different teams/projects have different workflow expectations, and different levels of reliance on so-called \"dev-only\" packages, and that your latter flow (\"apply fix ASAP\") is *much* preferred over a flow that requires every project owner to deeply understand vulnerabilities and updates and workarounds and release schedules.\r\n @alexch you don't need to disable preflight checks if you install the same version of jest (23.6 instead of 24) in your node code.  If you decide to use Jest 24, then disabling preflight checks is a perfectly valid course of action for your decision.\r\n\r\n@jdalegonzalez this is unfortunately the difference between reality and an ideal world.  Ideally you would run a command that would fix everything, but the reality is that APIs change between versions (especially majors), we have deeply nested dependencies, and most open source projects don't  have the resources to back port each fix to older versions.  All of your npm modules have various version dependencies (eg Jest 23 uses micromatch 2 but eslint might use micromatch 3 at the same time) so you can't always have the latest packages for every nested dependency.  So yes, it needs to be on a case-by-case basis.  If you are on a team then one person should be the POC for security related issues.  If you aren't sure about a particular vulnerability assessment, issues are one of the perfectly valid ways of asking for help. Handlebars just joined the party with a High priority vulnerability too Yep. That's why we pulled it out.

Our CI is currently blocked even though jest is a dev dependency. \r\n\r\nLooks like yarn doesn't allow for auditing production-only dependencies.  I don't really understand why, but it seems like this is related to my perfect-scrollbar being on the left of my page instead of the right - I'm getting identical vulnerabilities after running `npm audit`, but everything else is working fine.\r\n\r\nEdit: running Material Dashboard Pro @dlipeles why would this block a CI?  Is it because of the preflight check or do you have a build step that hinges on yarn audit succeeding?  In any case, if you are yarn, you could use yarn resolutions to pin micromatch to v3 but it might break something, YMMV. NPM Audit is part of CI pipeline and due to this issue it is failing every time I pushed the code.\r\n\r\nWhy this issue started to occurred, I have not updated any package? \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1296\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-02-19 at 2 31 32 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19687185/53002656-2d647900-3453-11e9-84da-19b18ffacfca.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"840\" alt=\"screen shot 2019-02-19 at 2 32 51 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19687185/53002685-479e5700-3453-11e9-887c-c47ab9cf4d9f.png\">\r\n Is it possible to change your CI pipeline to omit npm audit step?  From my experience it takes a non-trivial amount of time to test/deploy/propagate a security fix.  In most cases, when a security advisory is posted, either it doesn't affect your production build (such as this case), or that it is a real issue.  In the latter case, either a fix might not be immediately available/feasible, or there could be workarounds that might mitigate risk while keeping the package as-is, and blocking all builds until the package is updated might not be the best course of action.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This comment isn't meant as a call to ignore security warnings.  npm audit has its place and it should be done as part of security audit for your application.  It should be monitored and dealt on a case by case basis.  IMO it doesn't belong in a CI pipeline for the reasons mentioned above. > Is it possible to change your CI pipeline to omit npm audit step? From my experience it takes a non-trivial amount of time to test/deploy/propagate a security fix.\r\n\r\n@bugzpodder With all due respect, this feels like bad advice to me.  While I recognize that right this minute we're in a bit of a pickle as it relates to NPM audit, the idea that we all should ignore security warnings because most of the time they don't impact our app feels a little careless.  Almost all high-profile breaches I've ever seen reported start with someone thinking it wasn't a high-priority to patch some previously reported vulnerability.  A very low percentage of hacks are exploiting zero-day/unreported vulnerabilities.  Within the last six months, there were packages on npm that had the ability to steal cryptocurrency - no impact to the \"app\" itself, it just made the app a conduit for theft.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like \"for right now\" removing the audit from the CI pipeline is necessary while solutions are explored - I would at least sympathize and maybe agree.  If you're advocating (like some are) that the standard npm audit be wrapped in some script that filters out those warnings deemed as acceptable risk (again until npm fixes their audit system to support this natively), I would agree too.\r\n\r\nMaking the blanket suggestion that people stop depending on npm audit as a part of CI altogether because \"in most cases\" security advisories don't impact \"most\" production apps feels like a bridge too far.\r\n\r\n(of course, that's just my opinion.  I could be wrong) @jitenderchand1 \r\n> Why this issue started to occurred, I have not updated any package?\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability was discovered in an existing package.

This is not the place to debate the merits of `npm audit` or how your CI should be set up.\r\n\r\nSince Jest isn't planning to backport this fix to Jest 23 the only thing we can do is release a major version of Create React App with Jest 24. We are currently working on that and you can follow the progress on upgrading to Jest 24 here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6278 Potentially, you can get a patch into `braces`/`micromatch` (although it's v2, with v3 being current major and v4 right around the corner).\r\n\r\nNote that upgrading from micromatch 2 to 3 is a breaking change in and of itself, so there's really no way Jest can backport a fix to v23 any updates ?? @Waseemrajashaik Based on @iansu's comment above, I think #6278 is relevant to your question. > Let's focus on the issue here. This is not the place to debate the merits of `npm audit` or how your CI should be set up.\r\n\r\nAgreed.  I shared my view on the merits of `npm audit` in the [npm forum](https://npm.community/t/npm-audit-ripple-effects/5786). I hope I represented the technical aspects correctly. even thought installed latest  CRA it still gives. Any updates? FWIW, I went through my node_modules folder and searched out each instance of `micromatch`. I opened the respective folders and the `package.json` in each and manually changed the `braces dependency` version to `2.3.2`. Jest was not the only culprit; after updating their package.json files I also had to update this in about 8 other packages *edit* nested inside Jest; so I guess you could say it's all Jest. They were all on 2.3.1, except one that was 1.8.5.\r\n\r\nI did `npm install` to re-scan and install per the new `package.json`s.\r\n\r\nThis resolved the warning (as the fix is >2.3.1) and CRA works fine.\r\n\r\nHere's my npm tree now:\r\n\r\n*edit* - I'm parsing this down. My npm tree was frickin huge. Hopefully this makes it easier for others to do the same, instead of digging folder by folder.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n+-- react-scripts@2.1.8\r\n| ...\r\n| +-- jest@23.6.0\r\n| | ...\r\n| |   +-- jest-get-type@22.4.3\r\n| |   +-- jest-haste-map@23.6.0\r\n| |   | +-- fb-watchman@2.0.0\r\n| |   | `-- sane@2.5.2\r\n| |   |   ...\r\n| |   |   +-- micromatch@3.1.10\r\n| |   |   | ...\r\n| |   |   | +-- braces@2.3.2 \r\n| |   |   | ...\r\n| |   +-- jest-message-util@23.4.0\r\n| |   | ...\r\n| |   | +-- braces@2.3.2 \r\n...\r\n| | +-- fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin@1.0.0-alpha.6\r\n| | | ...\r\n| | | +-- micromatch@3.1.10\r\n| | | | ...\r\n| | | | +-- braces@2.3.2\r\n| | | | | ...\r\n| | +-- globby@8.0.2\r\n| | | ...\r\n| | | +-- fast-glob@2.2.6\r\n| | | | +-- merge2@1.2.3\r\n| | | | `-- micromatch@3.1.10\r\n| | | |   +-- braces@2.3.2\r\n| | | |   | ...\r\n| | +-- micromatch@3.1.10\r\n| | | ...\r\n| | | +-- braces@2.3.2\r\n| | | |...\r\n| +-- webpack-dev-server@3.1.14\r\n| | ...\r\n| | +-- chokidar@2.1.5\r\n| | | +...\r\n| | | | ...\r\n| | | +-- braces@2.3.2\r\n...\r\n| | | +-- readdirp@2.2.1\r\n| | | | +-- graceful-fs@4.1.15 deduped\r\n| | | | +-- micromatch@3.1.10\r\n| | | | | ...\r\n| | | | | +-- braces@2.3.2\r\n| | | | | |...\r\n| | +-- compression@1.7.4\r\n| | |...\r\n| | | +-- lodash@4.17.11 deduped\r\n| | | `-- micromatch@3.1.10\r\n| | |   ...\r\n| | |   +-- braces@2.3.2\r\n| | |   ...\r\n`-- typescript@3.4.1\r\n``` Hmm ok so what would be the fastest way to continue working on my old project right now if npm audit fails, barring completely ignoring the issue by installing with --no-audit?

Was googling, was searching in this repository. Found nothing about this thread. I think this is an issue with our `terser` config. This looks like it may help: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#preserve-comments I have figured out. I don't have `@license` tag in my JSDoc, but is that so important to place this tag at license notice (i understand that if i haven't placed this tag - my license notice will be stripped)?\r\n\r\nI can point to a very popular projects which doesn't use `@license` tag for license notice, for example: [react](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react/index.js), [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js), [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/js/bootstrap.js).\r\n\r\nBTW, you can use [this](https://github.com/vuchastyi/vuchastyi.com) repository for testing. Owww...\r\nI have found out that i was wrong. `react-scripts` just remove all comments from source files, which causes the issue.\r\n\r\nAfter some research (thanks @ianschmitz), i can say that this issue is really related with `terser` config, as pointed by @iansu.\r\n\r\nI would like to submit PR, but there much ways to fix this issue and i don't know which suits most for React Community.\r\n\r\nSo, the ways:\r\n1. I can modify `terser` options at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/df3e73f454f718dbb3f928ecf681a50467e5a18d/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L215 with `comments: /^!|\\*!/,`\r\n\\\r\n**Advantages**: it will place copyright notices inside chunks.\r\n**Disadvantages**: all copyright notices will be placed somewhere in the middle of chunks (not at top of the file). It will also keep copyright notices of other packages such as object-assign, React, etc. Not all chunks will contain project copyright notice, only those which source contain this notice (it's boring to include it in each file).\r\n2. I can modify terser config at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/df3e73f454f718dbb3f928ecf681a50467e5a18d/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L227 with\r\n`  extractComments: /^!|\\*!/,`\r\n`}),`\r\n\\\r\n**Advantages**: it will place comment at top of each chunk like 'License information can be found in chunk.LICENSE'. Will be created file `chunk.LICENSE`, this file will contain information about used licenses.\r\n**Disadvantages**: chunks will not contain copyright notices (it will contain only comment which will reference to real file where licenses are stored). Also it will keep copyright notices of other packages such as object-assign, React, etc. Not all chunk license files will contain project copyright notice, only those which source contain this notice (it's boring to include it in each file).\r\n3. Create `scripts/build.js` file inside main project (it should be created by user, not by package). In this file transfer whole copyright notice into env variable like `REACT_APP_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE=/* Copyright 2019-present ... \\n * Licensed under MIT \\n */ react-scripts build`. \\\r\nUse it like `\"build\": \"scripts/build.js\"`. \\\r\nAnd then in `react-scripts` catch this env variable like https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/df3e73f454f718dbb3f928ecf681a50467e5a18d/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L39 and use to display before each chunk.\r\n*Also it can be configured via dotenv files and without `scripts/build.js` file.*\r\n\\\r\n**Advantages**: it will place project copyright notice as needed.\r\n**Disadvantages**: currently i don't know way to place env var at the top of each chunk. Any comments? Option 1 sounds like the best choice to me. Larger bundle size is better than license violation especially in case of the default option.\r\n\r\nI'll suggest more options and I believe option 5 can solve both legal and bundle size problems:\r\n\r\n### 1'. Keep (more) legal comments in chunk js file.\r\nSame as option 1 but use different regexp. `/^\\**!|@preserve|@license|@cc_on/i` for comments option.\r\nThis is the default regexp of extractComments config of terser-webpack-plugin and this can keep most of legal notice comments.\r\n\r\n### 2'. Extract (more) legal comment into `chunk.LICENSE` file.\r\nSame as option 2 but use default regexp (`/^\\**!|@preserve|@license|@cc_on/i`) of terser-webpack-plugin with adding `extractComments: true`.\r\n\r\nsee: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#extractcomments\r\n\r\n### 4. Extract legal comments and preserve @license comments.\r\nWe can preserve `@license` comments in chunk js file and extract other legal (i.e. /^\\**!|@preserve|@license|@cc_on/i) comments into `chunk.LICENSE` file with terser config like this:\r\n```\r\n      new TerserPlugin({\r\n        terserOptions: {\r\n          output: {\r\n            comments: /@license/i,\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n        extractComments: true,\r\n      }),\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis comes from example usage of terser-webpack-plugin:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin#preserve-comments\r\n\r\n### 5. Extract legal comments and add link to it from top of chunk js file.\r\nExtract legal comments with `extractComments: true` terser option to make `chunk.LICENSE` file (same as option 2') and add 1 line legal comment on top of the chunk js files:\r\n```\r\n/*! Create React App vX.X.X | (c) Facebook and other contributors | see chunk.LICENSE file for more license information */\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the similar approach as jQuery:\r\n```\r\n/*! jQuery v3.3.1 | (c) JS Foundation and other contributors | jquery.org/license */\r\n``` Sorry, option 5 is actually same as option 2'. Option 2' will automatically add license notice comment on top of the chunk.js file. Option 2' can solve both legal and bundle size problem.\r\n\r\n1st line of the `chunk.js` file generated with `extractComments: true` option will be:\r\n```\r\n/*! For license information please see 2.xxxxxxxx.chunk.js.LICENSE */\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `2.xxxxxxxx.chunk.js.LICENSE` file will be:\r\n```\r\n/*\r\nobject-assign\r\n(c) Sindre Sorhus\r\n@license MIT\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/** @license React v16.8.4\r\n * react.production.min.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n\r\n/** @license React v16.8.4\r\n * react-dom.production.min.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n\r\n/** @license React v0.13.4\r\n * scheduler.production.min.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n```  Hi,\r\nThe InlineChunkHtmlPlugin generate a script tag inside the index.html.\r\nSo if we choose to use xhtml in the HtmlWebpackPlugin we got some troubles.

Can I find it in chrome dev tool?\r\nI can't find it in the network panel.\r\n\r\n3. Does wrong assets-manifest.json break a site? Whether it can be cached or must not be cached?\r\n Hey! Does this [page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/manifest/) help with your questions? Yeah, I've read this part before I start this issue. \r\nThe problem is I didn't see a clean clue of how does it work. \r\nNo `assets-manifest.json` in index.html. No `assets-manifest.json` in network panel.\r\nDoes it only work during `npm run build`? I am not sure about the current version, but it used to be as you write, generating manifest only in production builds. It does not get loaded with your website as you point out, there are no references to it from source files. The objective of manifest is to create an asset map for tools as per [comments in the source code](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/6a5b3cdaaa7e9ee2cae358a50cf005af9d1408bd/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L593-L599). I am not sure which tools specifically this is targeted for (browser tools? dev tools?). Subsequently, if you cache this file and your assets change, you would have to update your manifest, too. It does not have a hash in its name, so I wouldn't cache it in case it breaks file references. Aha! So my question collapses to what tools will pick up `assets-manifest.json`.\r\n```\r\n      // Generate a manifest file which contains a mapping of all asset filenames\r\n      // to their corresponding output file so that tools can pick it up without\r\n      // having to parse `index.html`.\r\n      new ManifestPlugin({\r\n        fileName: 'asset-manifest.json',\r\n        publicPath: publicPath,\r\n      }),\r\n```\r\nI used `git blame` to find the [original commit](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/commit/88c15d0988fcb456fc976cbe15823ed518470126) and the related [issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/600) to this comment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the [link](http://myappincome.co.uk/how-to-make-a-react-js-wordpress-plugin/) might contains the details is broken. The only thing I know now is it's related to WordPress.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna @ the related contributor @lukyth  and issue owner @gaearon to see if they know more. > Aha! So my question collapses to what tools will pick up `assets-manifest.json`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/humanmade/react-wp-scripts#how-it-works\r\n\r\n> When you run `npm run build` in a `create-react-app` project, `react-scripts` uses the [`webpack-manifest-plugin`](https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin) to output an `assets-manifest.json` file containing the paths of all generated assets. Since files are generated with content hashes in their filename, this file can be ingested from PHP to ensure we are enqueueing the right scripts or styles for our application. Thanks a lot, @lukyth!\r\n\r\nSo, can I come to this conclusion that when I deploy the `build` folder as a normal static website with nginx, I don't need to serve assets-manifest.json at all because it doesn't affect my website at all? @iansu Do you think it would be worth specifying for which tools is the assets manifest generated? @Stupidism Yes, you're right. :)  I made a search in the PR's and nothing came up, so hence my PR.\r\n\r\nAs most used IDE's for development are Jetbrains IDEA / Webstorm etc which use `.idea` and Visual Studio Code which uses `.vscode`.\r\n\r\nI want to add these to the templates of the gitignore files, so they are ignored by default.\r\n Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

This used to work until recently when I updated my project dependencies. It was a big update with a lot of breaking changes, so it's difficult to guess which specific change causes this issue.\r\n\r\nI updated to Babel 7 and Webpack 4. Now when I open my project, I can see under `Problems` (same place in sidebar where `Terminal` tab is located) the error message below and live linting is broken. My build pipelines work, this seems to be the last broken piece.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nLive code linter should work and highlight issues as I make mistakes.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nParsing error: [BABEL] /project/file.js: Using `babel-preset-react-app-babel-7` requires that you specify `NODE_ENV` or `BABEL_ENV` environment variables. Valid values are \"development\", \"test\", and \"production\". Instead, received: undefined. (While processing: \"/project/file.js$1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nN/A. \u2639\ufe0f\r\n  Seems like the decision to find a supported solution for component sharing e.g Lerna has taken priority over support the current CRA code sharing methods.\r\n\r\nPretty much the same issue as #2537 \r\n\r\nimporting multiple component and utility libraries from private registry. these are not transpiled (in some cases they are but importing the specific modules significantly reduce the bundle size) Jest freaks out and we end up needing to make changes to the CLI scripts in order to keep jest happy.\r\n\r\nit should be a pretty simple change in principle. not sure why this was originally closed... yes it is related to sharing components but in the end its a separate specific case for a small change to allow a config override where they already exist. not to put too fine a point to it... but this can be achieved by adding one line of code to the allowed list of configs... again... not sure why this was bumped back other than to look for a lerna based system. +1.\r\n\r\nI think I can understand the reasoning about locking it down, but maybe there should be a mechanism to extend rather than overwrite CRA jest config defaults? I'm looking to extend moduleDirectories, otherwise, I've got to change a bunch of imports that are working fine in production and dev, but not in test.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

The following valid TypeScript also causes the linter's parsing to fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction foo<T = any>() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough this works fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface Foo<T = any> {\r\n}\r\n``` eslint also trips over this:\r\n```ts\r\ntype Id<T> = {\r\n    [Prop in keyof T]: T[Prop];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nParsing error: Unexpected token, expected \"]\"\r\n\r\n   6 | \r\n   7 | type Id<T> = {\r\n>  8 |     [Prop in keyof T]: T[Prop];\r\n     |           ^\r\n   9 | }\r\n  10 | \r\n  11 | type S = Id<{foo: \"bar\"}>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like the babel-eslint parser configured in the config doesn't handle TypeScript. Here's the config from the eslint-config-react-app package:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/319cf9b9e1833a4b31209b9dea0d03e89b996d71/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L29\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/319cf9b9e1833a4b31209b9dea0d03e89b996d71/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js#L41-L47\r\n I have a similar (the same?) problem, see #6360. Tested with CRA 2.1.5 and current HEAD. Add TypeScript linting support\r\nIssue #5641 \r\nPull #6513  That's strange, because simply creating a new project with `yarn create react-app test --typescript`, adding an `.eslintrc.json` to the project root containing only `{ \"extends\": \"react-app\" }` and using the ESLint plugin for VS Code shows this error for perfectly valid TS code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8960836/54138212-514a2780-441f-11e9-817c-c1324628a444.png)\r\n Same for `keyof`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17093532/55296395-af8a7a80-53cd-11e9-845b-88a9f1884bb4.png)\r\n\r\n Wow. That is weird. I was able to resolve the issues by defining my own eslint config with typescript parser and plugin.  Importing dependencies into an app created with `create-react-app` that [use `require.ensure` as a fallback option](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/960213cb6963f9bf46d6224805de2dc73fef0af4/src/display/api.js#L42-L98) causes the following warning in the console;\r\n\r\n```\r\n./node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.js\r\nCritical dependency: require function is used in a way in which dependencies cannot be statically extracted\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because the webpack settings in `create-react-app` do not allow dependencies to use `require.ensure`, but [it seems that some libraries need to include this as a conditional fallback](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/10253).\r\n\r\nOne possible solution might be to remove [`{ parser: { requireEnsure: false } }`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blame/49e258b4a6d04fb7e3542d7a060c6dcad4093564/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L302) from the webpack configuration. I don't see much context or discussion about why that rule is important other than that it's not a standard language feature. \r\n\r\nI can see the argument from both sides, both why `create-react-app` would want to warn about this, and why another package might want to include it as a fallback. I don't know the correct solution, but this causes noisy warnings in the console when starting an app that make it more difficult to focus on actionable warnings.\r\n\r\nMaybe the correct solution is to [allow the suppression of unwanted warnings in `create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1947), but that seems to be a settled issue.\r\n\r\nI'm open to any other workarounds or solutions. Thanks for writing this up!\r\n\r\nI'm in the same situation and had to set the CI env variable, for a work-around.\r\nA mechanism for supressing these types of warnings would be a splendid solution. In longer term we don\u2019t promise continued support for this feature \u2014 so it seems to make sense for it to warn. That\u2019s better than if it breaks with no warning in a future release.\r\n\r\nCode published to npm ideally shouldn\u2019t be using webpack specific features. Can you explain more about why pdfjs is an exception, and why they use it? From what I understand, [the code using `require.ensure` in PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/960213cb6963f9bf46d6224805de2dc73fef0af4/src/display/api.js#L42-L98) is a fallback for non-webpack environments. In a webpack environment that code is irrelevant, but `create-react-app` still warns about it because it doesn't know from a static analysis that it's irrelevant.\r\n\r\n@gaearon Do you have a specific recommendation for PDF.js contributors @timvandermeij or @Snuffleupagus on what would be the preferred way to support non-webpack users with this fallback? I'm sure this would be of general interest as well, since I've seen quite a few packages where people are reporting this warning.  I'd really like to see a solution to this issue as it's currently holding us up from using react-pdf without having any alternative. @akuji1993 same thought \ud83d\udc4d \r\n   <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nAfter following the steps listed by \"gaearon\" on [this link](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2534) I still get the following error:\r\n\r\n\"C:/Users/james/node_modules/react-redux/es/components/Context.js\r\nModule not found: Can't resolve 'react' in 'C:\\Users\\james\\node_modules\\react-redux\\es\\components'\"\r\n\r\nI've installed the latest npm.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

That will help us resolve this faster. Hi @james-randolph-50 , even I got the same error when I npm installed `react-redux` first and `redux` later.  I assume, `react-redux` is having some dependencies on `redux`, which might have created this error. So, I deleted the `package-lock.json` , ran `npm install` and then `npm start` as said by @gaearon at the link mentioned above. This solved my issue. Thanks @gaearon , @james-randolph-50 .

A constant enum expression is a subset of TypeScript expressions that can be fully evaluated at compile time. An expression is a constant enum expression if it is:\r\n> 1. a literal enum expression (basically a string literal or a numeric literal)\r\n> 2. **a reference to previously defined constant enum member (which can originate from a different enum).**  ### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.2\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 11.6.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v11.6.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.12.3 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v11.6.0/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.5.0-next.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v11.6.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 72.0.3626.96\r\n    Firefox: 64.0\r\n    Safari: 12.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.8.1 => 16.8.1 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.1 => 16.8.1 \r\n    react-scripts: ^2.1.4 => 2.1.4 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nStarting from my project with `react-scripts: 2.1.3`,\r\n\r\n - `yarn` \r\n - `yarn test` working \r\n - `yarn add react-scripts@2.1.4`\r\n - `yarn test` working\r\n - `yarn-deduplicate` [what is this](https://github.com/atlassian/yarn-deduplicate)\r\n\r\nIntroducing these modifications in the `yarn.lock`\r\n\r\n```\r\n-\"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring@7.3.2\":\r\n+\"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring@7.3.2\", \"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring@^7.0.0\", \"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring@^7.2.0\":\r\n   version \"7.3.2\"\r\n \r\n-\"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring@^7.0.0\", \"@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring@^7.2.0\":\r\n-  version \"7.2.0\"\r\n-\r\n\r\n-ajv@^6.1.0, ajv@^6.5.3, ajv@^6.5.5:\r\n-  version \"6.7.0\"\r\n-\r\n-ajv@^6.9.1:\r\n+ajv@^6.1.0, ajv@^6.5.3, ajv@^6.5.5, ajv@^6.9.1:\r\n   version \"6.9.1\"\r\n\r\n-autoprefixer@^9.3.1:\r\n-  version \"9.4.6\"\r\n-\r\n-autoprefixer@^9.4.2:\r\n+autoprefixer@^9.3.1, autoprefixer@^9.4.2:\r\n   version \"9.4.7\"\r\n\r\n-caniuse-lite@^1.0.0, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000884, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000929:\r\n-  version \"1.0.30000929\"\r\n-\r\n-caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000918, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000932:\r\n+caniuse-lite@^1.0.0, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000884, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000918, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000929, caniuse-lite@^1.0.30000932:\r\n   version \"1.0.30000936\"\r\n\r\n-core-js@2.6.4:\r\n+core-js@2.6.4, core-js@^2.4.0, core-js@^2.4.1, core-js@^2.5.0, core-js@^2.5.7:\r\n   version \"2.6.4\"\r\n \r\n-core-js@^2.4.0, core-js@^2.4.1, core-js@^2.5.0, core-js@^2.5.7:\r\n-  version \"2.6.3\"\r\n-\r\n\r\n-postcss@^7.0.0, postcss@^7.0.1, postcss@^7.0.13, postcss@^7.0.2, postcss@^7.0.5:\r\n-  version \"7.0.13\"\r\n-\r\n-postcss@^7.0.14, postcss@^7.0.6:\r\n+postcss@^7.0.0, postcss@^7.0.1, postcss@^7.0.14, postcss@^7.0.2, postcss@^7.0.5, postcss@^7.0.6:\r\n   version \"7.0.14\"\r\n\r\n-react-error-overlay@^5.1.0:\r\n-  version \"5.1.2\"\r\n-\r\n-react-error-overlay@^5.1.3:\r\n+react-error-overlay@^5.1.0, react-error-overlay@^5.1.3:\r\n   version \"5.1.3\"\r\n\r\n-resolve@1.10.0, resolve@^1.9.0:\r\n+resolve@1.10.0, resolve@^1.1.6, resolve@^1.1.7, resolve@^1.2.0, resolve@^1.3.2, resolve@^1.5.0, resolve@^1.6.0, resolve@^1.8.1, resolve@^1.9.0:\r\n   version \"1.10.0\"\r\n \r\n-resolve@^1.1.6, resolve@^1.1.7, resolve@^1.2.0, resolve@^1.3.2, resolve@^1.5.0, resolve@^1.6.0, resolve@^1.8.1:\r\n-  version \"1.9.0\"\r\n-\r\n```\r\n\r\n - `yarn`\r\n - `yarn test` not working anymore\r\n\r\n```\r\n Test suite failed to run\r\n\r\n    Cannot find module '/Users/.../node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault' from 'setupTests.ts'\r\n\r\n      1 | import { configure } from 'enzyme';\r\n      2 | import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';\r\n    > 3 | import 'jest-extended';\r\n        |                              ^\r\n      4 | import 'jest-localstorage-mock';\r\n      5 | import { getSnapshotDiffSerializer, toMatchDiffSnapshot } from 'snapshot-diff';\r\n      6 | \r\n\r\n      at Resolver.resolveModule (node_modules/jest-resolve/build/index.js:221:17)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (src/setupTests.ts:3:30)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf needed I'll try to make a reproductible demo.

I'm not sure if this is related to your work, but your name popped up. I had a workaround where I told yarn not to hoist \r\n \"**/babel-preset-react-app/@babel/runtime\"\r\nIt might be because previously two different versions of @babel/runtime were used so it was not hoisted when installed, but now that the versions match the package is hoisted to the top level node modules.. @bugzpodder Do you know if there is a comparable solution for npm users? Sorry I only use yarn on this project because of workspaces.  I tried a fresh install of create-react-app but didn't run into this issue. @bugzpodder understood. I also can't repro this on a fresh CRA install. I think this issue may be related to the testing toolchain, as my error output looks very similar to @VincentLanglet's:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAIL src/components/MyComponent/MyComponent.test.js\r\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\r\n\r\n    Cannot find module '/Users/jeremykahn/[PROJECT]/node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault' from 'setupTests.js'\r\n\r\n      1 | import { configure } from 'enzyme';\r\n      2 | import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';\r\n    > 3 | import 'jest-enzyme';\r\n        |                      ^\r\n      4 | \r\n      5 | configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });\r\n      6 | \r\n\r\n      at Resolver.resolveModule (node_modules/jest-resolve/build/index.js:221:17)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (src/setupTests.js:3:30)\r\n``` I tried to make a minimal repo with this bug.

Thanks!  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nNo, we've reverted #6080, but want to continue this work in the near future.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nCreate an application using `npx create-react-app option1 option2 option3`. A project called `option1` is created, and other arguments are ignored without user feedback.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWhen creating an application with `npx create-react-app [options]`, I should be warned if an option doesn't exist or is invalid.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nWhen creating an application with `npx create-react-app [options]`, I can pass in non-existent arguments. @mrmckeb @iansu I would love to address this. Could you guide me on an effective way to handle those arguments as you intend :thinking:   <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.4 Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS, Trusty Tahr\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600K CPU @ 3.50GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 9.11.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.6.0 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 5.6.0 - ~/.npm-global/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 71.0.3578.98\r\n    Firefox: 64.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @types/react: ^16.8.2 => 16.8.2 \r\n    @types/react-dom: ^16.8.0 => 16.8.0 \r\n    react: ^16.8.1 => 16.8.1 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.8.1 => 16.8.1 \r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.3 => 2.1.3 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 1.5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nJust follow the steps from the `Reproducible Demo` part and open console in browser.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBrowsers console should print `someProperty type: Number`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIt prints `couldn't get the type :(`.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git@github.com:elderapo/cra2-reflect-metadata-bug.git\r\ncd cra2-reflect-metadata-bug\r\nyarn\r\nyarn start\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The problem\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that babel completely strips out TS types before compilation process which makes it impossible for `reflect-metadata` package to do its work.\r\n Are there any plans regarding this issue?\r\n\r\nI understand that there might not be an easy fix becuase of how babel compiles typescript. However, there are few nice libraries (ex. `InversifyJS`) that heavily rely on `reflect-metadata` package and the fact that `cra-2` is not complatible is really discouraging.\r\n\r\n @iansu, here you go https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9681. Any likelihood of getting [babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata](https://github.com/leonardfactory/babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata) added? It seems like a sensible default if Typescript is used anywhere, since a lot of libraries use the type metadata. That might be possible. It depends how mature that plugin is and what kind of impact it has on build performance. cc @ianschmitz @mrmckeb  @iainbeeston can we config babel and eslint in CRA\uff1fIn this way, the responsibility for maintaining the plugin of babel can be given to the user.  It is necessary to uninstall any version that was previously installed for the typescript flag to work when using npx.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

If I've ever worked on a different app, its `localStorage` is now polluting my new app as they share an origin.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIf `HOST === 'localhost'` then call `opn` with `target` set to `http://{folder-name}.localhost:{port}`\r\n\r\nThis way every app has a unique origin and this its own `localStorage`. I know that I can do this manually, but having CRA do it for me would be nice.\r\n\r\n## Thoughts?\r\n\r\nThis is related to #2578, but writing a script to get this to work seems like a lot of duplicated effort for each project\r\n\r\nI also can't just [set HOST](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration) as it won't bind to `{folder-name}.localhost` This seems like a pretty good idea.

We have no need for the standard watcher of the index.js since the applications won't run outside of the website environment.\r\n\r\nThe applications build fine but as soon as we try to watch it won't reload the build task; it will only trigger a change on the index.js.\r\n\r\nOur package.json:\r\n```\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"dev\": \"webpack --config scripts/build.dev.js --watch --progress\",\r\n    \"prod\": \"node scripts/build.prod.js\",\r\n    \"test\": \"node scripts/test.js\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've defined the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/// paths.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  ProductListerApplicationDP: resolveModule(resolveApp, 'src/productlister/app'),\r\n  ProductSearchApplicationDP: resolveModule(resolveApp, 'src/productlister/app'),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n///webpack.config.js\r\nentry: {\r\nProductListerApplicationDP: paths.ProductListerApplicationDP,\r\n      ProductSearchApplicationDP: paths.ProductSearchApplicationDP,\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would we need to do to refresh the ```dev``` task on change when we make a change in ProductListerApplicationDP or  ProductSearchApplicationDP application?\r\n  Fixes #6271, added ie 11 to browserslist for googlebot Hey thanks for the PR. I've read the linked issue, but i don't think this PR improves that. \r\n\r\n`browserslist` currently only affects the CSS output, but not the javascript. Currently javascript transpilation ignores `browserslist` and is forced to compile down to support `ie9` as seen [in our babel config](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/313e4723312c573267c11d771a31bc4f7fac0b82/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js#L82-L89).\r\n\r\nHowever i would be in favor of the change you've made (`\"not ie <= 10\"`) to include ie11 in the default `browserslist` Thanks for the info around browserslist affecting only css. I did not know that. \r\n\r\n> However i would be in favor of the change you've made (`\"not ie <= 10\"`) to include ie11 in the default `browserslist`\r\n\r\nDo you want me to make any more changes here? still waiting for a response  I previously asked a question about the warning about unmeet peer dependency here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6134\r\nI had the answer `these are just warnings and nothing to worry about`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately now I have errors:\r\nWhen I install `\"@storybook/react\"` and run `\"storybook\": \"start-storybook -p 9009 -s public\"`,\r\nI get ` Error: Cannot find module 'babel-loader/package.json' from ...`\r\n\r\nBut if I install `babel-loader`, and run `\"start\": \"react-scripts start\"`, I get\r\n```\r\nThere might be a problem with the project dependency tree.\r\nIt is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.\r\n\r\nThe react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:\r\n\r\n  \"babel-loader\": \"8.0.4\"\r\n\r\nDon't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.\r\nHowever, a different version of babel-loader was detected higher up in the tree:\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, it's fixable if I install the exact version \"8.0.4\". Like explains here https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues/5183\r\nBut shouldn't `create-react-app` re-think about the way dependencies are used ?\r\n\r\nI don't know a lot about how it works. But why `react-script` version can't use his dependencies version and let other dependencies to use their ? Hi @VincentLanglet, this has been reported before as you mentioned.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a PR with Storybook to resolve this properly.\r\nhttps://github.com/storybooks/storybook/pull/5308 @mrmckeb Yes i saw that, a big thanks to you for working on it.\r\n\r\nBut I still wonder why it's not possible for `react-script` to use her own version of `babel-loader` and `@storybook/react` to use her own version of `babel-loader` too ?\r\nThe same could be done for others dependencies like `jest` or `eslint`.\r\n\r\nFor example, in my package.lock I have two `qs` version which cohabit together.\r\n```\r\nqs@6.5.2, qs@~6.5.1, qs@~6.5.2:\r\n  version \"6.5.2\"\r\n  ...\r\n\r\nqs@^6.5.1, qs@^6.6.0:\r\n  version \"6.6.0\"\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is it different with `react-script` dependencies ?\r\n(And not every dependencies, I have different `@babel/core` versions for example) I don't have storybook installed and I see this error as well. It seems there is a strict match for both `babel-preset-react-app` and `react-scripts`\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm ls babel-loader\r\nmy-package@0.1.0 /Users/gcallaghan/work/my-package\r\n\u2514\u2500\u252c react-scripts@2.1.3\r\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 babel-loader@8.0.4\r\n  \u2514\u2500\u252c babel-preset-react-app@7.0.1\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 babel-loader@8.0.5\r\n``` Hi @gcallaghan, that's odd, thanks for raising. Those projects should definitely be aligned, and realistically, we could resolve babel-loader from `babel-preset-react-app`... Would you be interested in raising a PR to look into that? @gcallaghan your `react-scripts` is not up to date.\r\nThe `2.1.5` version use `babel-loader@8.0.5`. I'll run yarn upgrade on my react-scripts now and see if that fixes it.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes, probably; either that or a documentation issue\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n\"Proxy\", \"Configuring the Proxy Manually\"\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nBefore upgrade to react-scripts 2.1.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.2\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 9.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v9.10.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 5.6.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v9.10.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 72.0.3626.81\r\n    Safari: 12.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^15.4.2 => 15.6.2\r\n    react-dom: ^15.4.2 => 15.6.2\r\n    react-scripts: 1.0.17 => 1.0.17\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter upgrade to react-scripts 2.1.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.2\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 9.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v9.10.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 5.6.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v9.10.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 72.0.3626.81\r\n    Safari: 12.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^15.4.2 => 15.4.2\r\n    react-dom: ^15.4.2 => 15.4.2\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.3 => 2.1.3\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Take a project with an advanced proxy configuration created with create-react-app 1.x and update the `react-scripts` package to the latest. \r\n\r\n2. Follow the upgrade instructions. Remove the proxy configuration from `package.json`. This is the original config (with exact URLs changed to protect the innocent, but retaining structure) :\r\n```\r\n\"proxy\": {\r\n    \"/api\": {\r\n      \"target\": \"http://localhost:9000\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"/some/thing\": {\r\n      \"target\": \"https://example.org:8452/\",\r\n      \"secure\": false,\r\n      \"changeOrigin\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"/some\": {\r\n      \"target\": \"https://example.org:7324\",\r\n      \"secure\": false,\r\n      \"changeOrigin\": true\r\n    },\r\n    \"/.*\": {\r\n      \"target\": \"https://example.org:8452/\",\r\n      \"secure\": false,\r\n      \"changeOrigin\": true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. Add `http-proxy-middleware` to the project. Create a `setupProxy.js` file in the `src` folder. Replace each entry as specified, leading to a file looking like this:\r\n```\r\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware')\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function(app) {\r\n\r\n    app.use('/api', proxy({ target: 'http://localhost:9000/' }))\r\n\r\n    app.use('/some/thing', proxy( \r\n        { \r\n            target: 'https://example.org:8452/',\r\n            secure: false,\r\n            changeOrigin: true,\r\n            logLevel: 'debug'\r\n\r\n        } \r\n    ))\r\n\r\n    app.use('/some', proxy(\r\n        { \r\n            target: 'https://example.org:7324/',\r\n            secure: false,\r\n            changeOrigin: true,\r\n            logLevel: 'debug'\r\n        } \r\n    ))\r\n\r\n    app.use(proxy('/.*',\r\n        {\r\n            target: 'example.org:8452/',\r\n            secure: false,\r\n            changeOrigin: true,\r\n            logLevel: 'debug'\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    ))\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Attempt to access a resource that was previously working, of the form `path/to/some/resource.do?with=some_parameters`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe resource is obtained as before, and everything works as it did in `create-react-app` 1.x\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe resource returned is the `index.html` file at the root of the project, rather than the endpoint returning json.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nCan't really provide one at the minute- things are pretty locked down here and I'd need to spin up a server elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated. @EdBoucher I have same problem. Do you have solution for this?  Sadly no, not yet. Sticking with the old version for now. If you find a way around it do let me know! Have the exact same problem. I'm on react-scripts 2.1.8 if thats relevant. I found my problem. I had proxy context as \"2/feeds\" when it needed to be \"/2/feeds\"\r\n\r\nFull working config incase it helps anyone else in future:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function(app) {\r\n  app.use(\r\n    proxy('/2/feeds',\r\n    {\r\n      target: 'https://api-stage.myexamplesite.com',\r\n      logLevel: 'debug',\r\n      secure: false,\r\n      changeOrigin: true,\r\n      onProxyReq(proxyReq) {\r\n        if (proxyReq.getHeader(\"origin\")) {\r\n          proxyReq.setHeader(\"origin\", 'https://api-stage.myexamplesite.com')\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrustrating typo mistake because of course it results in no logging output!\r\n\r\n@EdBoucher Is it possible the problem is you have a leading \"/\" on target and a trailing \"/\" on context, thus incorrectly your full string is concatenated to https://example.org:8452//some/thing (notice the double \"//\" near the end of the string)? I have being using setupProxy with no problems.\r\nI was using `app.use(proxy(\"/api\", { target: \"http://localhost:9000/\" }));` instead of `app.use('/api', proxy({ target: 'http://localhost:9000/' }))`\r\n\r\nEDIT: both ways seem to work well.  Please provide a repo case, otherwise I can't help you. Was just an untested suggestion. I'm glad its smart enough to avoid that kind of fault.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nnpm version: 6.4.1\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nsass, foundation\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.4 Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.15.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.1/bin/node\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.1/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0\r\n    react-dom: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0\r\n    react-scripts: ^2.1.3 => 2.1.3\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\nFWIW, the same issue exists with `react@16.8.0-alpha.1`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx create-react-app create-react-app-issue6339\r\ncd create-react-app-issue6339\r\nnpm i node-sass foundation-sites\r\necho \"SASS_PATH=node_modules/foundation-sites/scss\" >> .env\r\nmv src/App.css src/App.scss\r\nsed -i -e 's/App\\.css/App\\.scss/' src/App.js\r\necho \"@import 'util/util';\" | cat - src/App.scss > temp && mv temp src/App.scss\r\nnpm run start\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe file located at `node_modules/foundation-sites/scss/util/util` would be loaded. This is especially necessary when creating a custom `_settings.scss` file in the project (which ultimately attempts to load `util/util`).\r\n\r\nAlthough this issue is specifically about `foundation-sites`, it would theoretically hold true for any path conflicts between `SASS_PATH`, and local/global `node_modules`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nwebpack tries to load the [core node util](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-util) module.\r\n\r\nMost likely due to [this line](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L261) of the config, which takes all `node_modules` as precedence for `webpack`.\r\n\r\nThe following error is thrown:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n./src/styles/main.scss (./node_modules/css-loader??ref--6-oneOf-5-1!./node_modules/postcss-loader/src??postcss!./node_modules/sass-loader/lib/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-5-3!./src/styles/main.scss)\r\n// Copyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors.\r\n^\r\n      Invalid CSS after \"...N THE SOFTWARE.\": expected 1 selector or at-rule, was \"var getOwnPropertyD\"\r\n      in /mnt/c/Users/Justin/WORKSP~1/react/scratch/node_modules/util/util.js (line 1, column 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which comes from https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-util/blob/master/util.js#L22\r\n\r\nCan circumvent the issue using the node_modules-relative path, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@import `~foundation-sites/scss/util/util`; // works\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nCopy/paste \"Steps to Reproduce\" into a bash shell to demo the issue. I pushed the result of those steps [here](https://github.com/justinhelmer/create-react-app-issue6339) if you prefer a `git clone`\r\n\r\n### Potential solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the [webpack config](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js) to check for `SASS_PATH` in [env](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L76), and prefer it before `node_modules` in the [resolve.modules](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L261) array\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** no luck.  I am setting some environment variables in my build script, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"start\": \"REACT_APP_APPENV=local npm-run-all -p watch-css react-scripts-ts start\",\r\n\"build\": \"REACT_APP_APPENV=production npm run build-css && react-scripts-ts build\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `start` script works perfectly and I am able to access `REACT_APP_APPENV` via `process.env. REACT_APP_APPENV`.\r\n\r\nAlthough my `build` script does not copy over `REACT_APP_APPENV`, and `process.env. REACT_APP_APPENV` is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nI tried creating a fresh new project via `npx create-react-app new-app --typescript` and the same issue occurred. HI @zilions, we don't maintain `react-scripts-ts`, that's a different project. \r\n\r\nIf you're seeing this with our repo (using `react-scripts`) can you please provide more information? @mrmckeb - I migrated my project to `create-react-app` and the issue is still present.\r\n\r\n`react-scripts build` fails to copy environment variables that are prepended with `REACT_APP_`.\r\n\r\nSame info as my original post - I can access all environment variables prepended with `REACT_APP_` when using `react-scripts start`, although they are all `undefined` after serving a build created with `react-scripts build`. Hi @zilions, can you please complete the issue template and provide a repository with reproduction steps? This should be working, so we need to see what's happening in this case. Same problem here!\r\nMy package.json has the following line:\r\n\r\n```\"build-local\": \"REACT_APP_LOCAL=false react-scripts build\"```\r\n\r\nand my js snippet is something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (process.env.REACT_APP_LOCAL == 'true') {\r\n  const sampleVal = 0;\r\n} else {\r\n  const sampleVal = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand when I run `yarn build-local` it does not copy the `REACT_APP_` variables into the environment and it is impossible to get them from within the .js files. I think I found the issue (that is not an issue, actually). In order to use `REACT_APP_` variables it's mandatory to include `dotenv` into your project and then use them in the scripts.\r\n\r\nDo the following:\r\n`yarn add node-env`\r\nThen add the following line at the beginning of your script:\r\n`require('dotenv').config()`\r\nJust use your own `REACT_APP_` variable.\r\n\r\nSorry for the quick reply previous... This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Ok I too am observing this problem. I've set up typescript according to the [guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript)\r\n\r\nHere's my build script from `package.json`:\r\n```\r\n\"scripts\": {\r\n    \"build\": \"cross-env REACT_APP_VERSION=\\\"$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME (`echo $CI_COMMIT_SHA | cut -c 1-8`)\\\" react-scripts build\",\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME=testovaci_ref\r\n$ CI_COMMIT_SHA=testovaci_sha\r\n$ npm run build\r\n```\r\nWhat I see in the built `main....chunk.js` file is the following: ``\" (`echo  | cut -c 1-8`)\"``\r\n\r\nIf I run it in Git BASH using the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME=testovaci_ref\r\n$ CI_COMMIT_SHA=testovaci_sha\r\n$ REACT_APP_VERSION=\"$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME (`echo $CI_COMMIT_SHA | cut -c 1-8`)\" node ./node_modules/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js build\r\n```\r\nI'm getting the expected output: `\"testovaci_ref (testovac)\"`\r\n\r\nBut this still doesn't work when put into `package.json`.

[2322]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n(node:14436) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): Error: The system cannot find the path specified.\r\n\r\n(node:14436) [DEP0018] DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm trying to convert a react timer[ example](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class) into typescript. \r\n\r\nThe example looks a little like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nexport interface IContainerProps {\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface IContainerState {\r\n    date: Date;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class Container extends\r\n    Component<IContainerProps, IContainerState> {\r\n\r\n    private timerID: number | undefined;  // as required by clearInterval();\r\n\r\n    state = { date: new Date() };\r\n  \r\n    componentDidMount() {\r\n        this.timerID = setInterval(  // Error: see below\r\n            () => this.tick(),\r\n            1000\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    componentWillUnmount() {\r\n        clearInterval(this.timerID);\r\n    }\r\n    tick() {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            date: new Date()\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\r\n                <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n Error on this.timerID: \r\n\r\n> [ts] Type 'Timeout' is not assignable to type 'number'. [2322]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn a browser environment setInterval() should return back the same type that clearInterval() takes in; number.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nBecause of @types/node (which is needed for functionality such as 'process')  setInterval() returns the type NodeJS.Timeout instead of `number`. \r\n\r\nThere is a similar problem [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/9731) but the work around (specifying types in the compiler options in tsconfig.json) does not seem work here.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nJust create a file within the app and paste in the above example.\r\n\r\n Hi @HairyMaclary, I can see how this would be annoying... you could use `as` to force this into a browser timer, but that isn't a perfect solution.\r\n\r\nYou could consider creating a `tsconfig.json` in either the folder where your Node files live that adds the library there? Example:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45315304/cannot-find-namespace-nodejs-when-using-nodejs-timer-in-ionic-2/47367655#47367655 I think the easiest fix is to use `window.setInterval` and `window.clearInterval`. It'd be cool if this was handled by default though.  I am running into an issue when trying to start CRA when I have similar dependencies in the root of my yarn workspace monorepo. I have a .eslintrc in the root of my project along with all of my Eslint/Prettier packages so that all of my projects are able to receive linting/autoformatting.\r\n\r\nI just recently added CRA to my monorepo in an attempt to create a new application. This gives me an error message and I did not want to assume that I would not run into any future issues. I am hoping to learn the ideal solution to how to properly use CRA within a yarn workspace monorepo while also being able to have proper linting/autofortmatting via Eslint and Prettier.\r\n\r\nDemo repo below.\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nMaybe\r\nVery closely related to https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/4296. I was unable to decipher a proper solution from this discussion.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone demo repo below\r\n2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies\r\n3. Run `yarn workspace my-app start` to try to start the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nyarn start succeeds\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nGet error message:\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"capture\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486877/52095053-6b6a2d80-2576-11e9-9dea-ebe7a0a2b404.PNG\">\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\nhttps://github.com/clayhan/cra-yarn-test\r\n\r\nThanks for any help! Try the nohoist option, maybe this will get you started:\r\n\"nohoist\": [\r\n      \"**/babel-eslint\",\r\n      \"**/babel-jest\",\r\n      \"**/eslint\",\r\n      \"**/jest\",\r\n      \"**/webpack-dev-server\",\r\n      \"**/webpack-cli\"\r\n    ]\r\n @bugzpodder Thanks for the response. Just wondering, are you adding this to the root of your repo? My concern with adding nohoist is that then my projects won't be able to see my linting rules at the root, and then I'd have to manually install all the dev dependencies for linting to each project. I'll give this a shot today but I'm hoping that won't be the case. Yes I'm adding this to the root.  It simply installs packages in their respective directories rather than hoisting, so it should not have noticable impact in your build process.   @bugzpodder https://github.com/clayhan/cra-yarn-test\r\nI added the nohoist to my package.json in my root, but still no dice. Any thoughts on what I'm doing wrong? This example repo is an accurate representation of how my main project is currently laid out.\r\n\r\nSuper appreciative of your time. I would do one of two things: \r\n1) just pin your root eslint and babel-eslint to the versions CRA uses.\r\n```--- a/package.json\r\n+++ b/package.json\r\n@@ -3,13 +3,9 @@  \r\n \"workspaces\": [\r\n     \"packages/*\"\r\n   ],\r\n-  \"nohoist\": [\r\n-    \"/babel-eslint\",\r\n-    \"/eslint\"\r\n-  ],\r\n   \"devDependencies\": {\r\n-    \"babel-eslint\": \"^10.0.1\",\r\n-    \"eslint\": \"^5.12.1\",\r\n+    \"babel-eslint\": \"9.0.0\",\r\n+    \"eslint\": \"5.6.0\",\r\n     \"eslint-config-airbnb\": \"^17.1.0\",\r\n     \"eslint-config-prettier\": \"^4.0.0\",\r\n     \"eslint-config-react\": \"^1.1.7\",\r\n@@ -19,4 +15,4 @@\r\n     \"eslint-plugin-react\": \"^7.12.4\",\r\n     \"prettier\": \"^1.16.3\"\r\n   }\r\n-}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) remove the root eslint and babel-eslint and rely on your packages installations if you must use the latest version.  So something like this:\r\n```\r\n--- a/package.json\r\n+++ b/package.json\r\n@@ -4,12 +4,10 @@\r\n     \"packages/*\"\r\n   ],\r\n   \"nohoist\": [\r\n-    \"/babel-eslint\",\r\n-    \"/eslint\"\r\n+    \"**/babel-eslint\",\r\n+    \"**/eslint\"\r\n   ],\r\n   \"devDependencies\": {\r\n-    \"babel-eslint\": \"^10.0.1\",\r\n-    \"eslint\": \"^5.12.1\",\r\n     \"eslint-config-airbnb\": \"^17.1.0\",\r\n     \"eslint-config-prettier\": \"^4.0.0\",\r\n     \"eslint-config-react\": \"^1.1.7\",\r\n@@ -19,4 +17,4 @@\r\n     \"eslint-plugin-react\": \"^7.12.4\",\r\n     \"prettier\": \"^1.16.3\"\r\n   }\r\n-}\r\n``` @bugzpodder Still no dice on any sort of implementation. It seems CRA keeps defaulting to whatever is in the root node_modules and refuses to run. I'm hesitant to skip the check since this application I'm wanting to build is going to be something we keep for several years. Thinking since this seems to be a huge problem with CRA that I'm going to just skip it entirely. I tried replicating the 2nd option you gave me, but it still kept giving me the same issues.\r\n\r\nDo you possibly have a demo repo where you were able to accomplish option 2? Thanks a ton. I don't have a public repo, but if you follow these instructions it should just work:\r\n1) in your root (workspace) package.json, add the following nohoist option:\r\n ```\"nohoist\": [\r\n      \"**/babel-eslint\",\r\n      \"**/babel-jest\",\r\n      \"**/eslint\",\r\n      \"**/jest\",\r\n      \"**/webpack-dev-server\",\r\n      \"**/webpack-cli\"\r\n    ]```\r\n2) Make sure you don't have any of these packages in your root (workspace) package.json\r\n3) remove node_modules from the worksapce (root)\r\ndo another yarn install\r\n4) ensure your new node_modules/ doesn't contain any of these pacakges.  If there is a matching one then your nohoist is wrong.\r\n5) run yarn start in your cra directory and see that the error should go away.\r\n\r\ntldr nohoist should not install the specified packages in your root node_modules. Just FYI, `nohoist` should be under `workspaces` in `package.json`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"workspaces\": {\r\n  \"packages\": [\"packages/*\"],\r\n  \"nohoist\": [\"**/babel-eslint\", \"**/babel-eslint/**\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/#how-to-use-it  I'm trying to use as stated in https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet\r\n\r\n- file **.env**:\r\n\r\n```env\r\n...\r\nSASS_PATH=node_modules:src\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n- file **src/styles/index.scss**:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gives me this error:\r\n\r\n```error\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n./src/styles/index.scss (./node_modules/css-loader??ref--6-oneOf-5-1!./node_modules/postcss-loader/src??postcss!./node_modules/sass-loader/lib/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-5-3!./src/styles/index.scss)\r\n@import \"bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\r\n^\r\n      File to import not found or unreadable: bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I use below (with ~) it works:\r\n\r\n- file **src/styles/index.scss**:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n- package.json:\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@types/jest\": \"23.3.13\",\r\n    \"@types/node\": \"10.12.20\",\r\n    \"@types/react\": \"16.7.22\",\r\n    \"@types/react-router\": \"4.4.3\",\r\n    \"@types/react-router-dom\": \"4.3.1\",\r\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"16.0.11\",\r\n    \"bootstrap\": \"4.2.1\",\r\n    \"node-sass\": \"4.11.0\",\r\n    \"react\": \"16.7.0\",\r\n    \"react-dom\": \"16.7.0\",\r\n    \"react-router\": \"4.3.1\",\r\n    \"react-router-dom\": \"4.3.1\",\r\n    \"react-scripts\": \"2.1.3\",\r\n    \"typescript\": \"3.2.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"source-map-explorer\": \"1.6.0\"\r\n  },\r\n``` Hi @frederikhors, it looks like you haven't completed the issue template, which makes this very hard to resolve. If you can please supply the requested information, we can take a look at this for you. From the documentation for [material-components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react) it looks like the `.env` entry needs to be:\r\n\r\n`SASS_PATH=./node_modules`\r\n\r\nIf this works for you then it's probably just a correction to the [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet) that's needed.\r\n\r\nI had the same problem and it's fixed for me now. One quick follow on thought I had about this was that I'm not sure if my solution is cross platform.\r\n\r\nWas this the intent behind the original method? \r\n\r\n`SASS_PATH=node_modules:src`\r\n\r\nAs it happens, I am on Windows but use the linux syntax with Git Bash set as my IDE shell. hth I HAVE SAME PROBLEM. ANY SUGGESTION PLEASE... `SASS_PATH=node_modules` works for me. On Windows you have to use `./node_modules`. also @iansu can you include in the documentation that you need a semicolon instead of a colon on windows environments\r\n\r\n```\r\nSASS_PATH=./node_modules;./src\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://technology.customink.com/blog/2014/10/09/understanding-and-using-sass-load-paths/#where-sass-is-headed Just created a [PR](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6712) with the fix in the documentation. Please review.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\nWhen I save a files with a SCSS extension, it seems to take as long as recompiling the entire app; yet it seems that all that is needed is to just recompile the file that was changed; or perhaps just the SASS files? This would really speed up development when styling components.\r\n\r\n If you use yarn, you could try replacing node-sass with dart-sass, by simply adding the following section to your package.json and do a yarn install:\r\n```\r\n  \"resolutions\": {\r\n    \"node-sass\": \"npm:sass\"\r\n  },\r\n```\r\nThat may or may not help your case.  <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

I think this needs some investigation - would you like to take a look and raise a PR?\r\n\r\nI really want to contribute, not intending to give a task to you. I think some discussion is needed to help me fix this because I never put an eye inside the source code of `create-react-app` before. If no one can discuss, I still will try my best to solve, if solved, surely I'll raise a PR :) Default Hi, I noticed there are the issues with v2.1.3-v2.1.5 on npm registry only. These packages were published by @ianschmitz. Probably the local files in his environment have the `x` permission.\r\n\r\nTo check the packages on npm registry, run below commands.\r\n```\r\nwget -O - $(npm view react-scripts@2.1.5 dist.tarball) | tar zxvf -\r\nls -l package\r\n``` v2.1.6-2.1.8, released by @iansu, have no problem.\r\n\r\nWe may need a way to prevent a recurrence.  For people who try to use Jest 24, there is a different version of `micromatch` and it behaves differently.  These changes should make it behave the same before and after changing Jest versions.\r\n\r\nWithout this change, Jest 24 will come up with no files to test.\r\n\r\nI tested with `npm run test -- --listTests` on two projects, one with the default Jest 23 and another with the new Jest 24.  In addition to numerous normally named test files had some special case files like `src/.test.js`, `src/test.js`, and `src/somethingtest.js`.  Only the first two matched and the third one didn't; both pre-, and post- this change. Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Thanks! Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks! Hi @ngbrown, thanks for that. I think this change should be accompanied by a move to Jest 24... but I agree it's necessary for that. Let's hold off until that time, if that's OK? I submitted this separate because Jest 24 isn't quite ready (facebook/jest#7707) to be pulled into `create-react-app`. Because Jest 24 has better support for TypeScript people might want to try it out.  Since this is one of the first things they will run into, it might as well be fixed for everyone.\r\n\r\nBeing able to merge now is why I made sure the new pattern would work equivalently in the older `micromatch`. If jest 24 is blocked until a new major, it'd be a good idea to land this in the meantime If you've tested on windows and it works, this shouldn't be needed I tested CRA version 3.0.0-next.b0cbf2ca on windows, and it is not detecting any tests.\r\nThis PR solves the problem.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if there was any interest in reviving the [Add BuildProgressPlugin PR](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/1011) that got closed back in January, 2019\r\n\r\nI believe @Timer had it working but wasn't happy with the progress accuracy -> is this still true? not sure if [anything has changed](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/commits/master/lib/ProgressPlugin.js) but to me it seems like something would be better than nothing\r\n\r\nanyone else interested in this? I could try and revive the PR again at some point in the next few weeks\r\n\r\n I think we should abandon this pr and create a new one that use this plugin instead: https://github.com/clessg/progress-bar-webpack-plugin\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n I'll let @Timer chime in on this one, as I wasn't across it in detail. If there's a newer, more accurate version, that could also be good to discuss.\r\n\r\nBy the way, \"back in January, 2019\" is scary to say so soon ;) You caught me :-) January 2018 @Timer what do you think? Do you want @maniax89 or me(I hope its ok Andrew) to start working on it? I'm fine with you working on it @eladmotola  I never got a chance to work on it but would like this to stay open I'd like to dig into this if possible. Would acceptance criteria for this look like getting the webpack ProgressPlugin to work?  React source code inside sourcemaps generated by `create-react-app` adds many extra blank lines and extra indentation compared with React's `node_modules` source.  Because line and column numbers don't match between source maps and actual source, debuggers like VSCode don't accurately set breakpoints inside React source and can't accurately step into React source.  Debuggers like Chrome are not affected because they use the sitemap source (not the on-disk files) to set breakpoints.\r\n\r\nThis issue is the cause of #6044 that @raiskila filed 6 weeks ago. I created a new issue with a new repro to simplify the repro case, to remove the need to install VSCode to reproduce the problem, and to clarify that all file-based debuggers will be affected (not just VSCode).\r\n\r\nIt's possible that the root cause of this problem might be https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8302, although I don't know enough about webpack to know for sure one way or the other.  It's also possible that the problem is caused by `create-react-app`'s webpack configuration. It's also possible that the problem might be in how React itself is transforming its source code before publishing generated source files like `react-dom.development.js` to NPM.\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes. Well, really N/A because the repro starts with `npm install -g npm@latest` and `npx create-react-app` so there are no deps to recover!\r\n\r\nNPM version is the latest: 6.7.0\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nsourcemap sourcemaps \"source map\" \"source maps\" mismatch whitespace line breakpoint\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n**Environment Info:**\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.14.2\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4980HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 6.7.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 71.0.3578.98\r\n    Firefox: 63.0.1\r\n    Safari: 12.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0\r\n    react-dom: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.3 => 2.1.3\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n**1. Create a new app**\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g npm@latest\r\nnpx create-react-app sourcemap-bug\r\ncd sourcemap-bug\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n**2. Load the sourcemap and extract code from it**\r\n* 2.1 download https://localhost:3000/static/js/1.chunk.js.map (if this doesn't return a sourcemap, then try https://localhost:3000/static/js/0.chunk.js.map instead). If you're using HTTP for your CRA (I'm using HTTPS), then use http:// URLs instead of https.\r\n* 2.2 find the top of the `react-dom.developmment.js` source in the map by searching for \"`react-dom.development.js\\n`\" (without quotes) inside the sourcemap content. If it's not there, try http://localhost:3000/static/js/0.chunk.js.map instead. \r\n* 2.3 starting with `/** @license` which should be right before the found content, copy 40-50 lines of code. Here's an example of what I copied: \r\n> /** @license React v16.7.0\\n * react-dom.development.js\\n *\\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\\n *\\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\\n */\\n'use strict';\\n\\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \\\"production\\\") {\\n  (function () {\\n    'use strict';\\n\\n    var React = require('react');\\n\\n    var _assign = require('object-assign');\\n\\n    var checkPropTypes = require('prop-types/checkPropTypes');\\n\\n    var scheduler = require('scheduler');\\n\\n    var tracing = require('scheduler/tracing');\\n    /**\\n     * Use invariant() to assert state which your program assumes to be true.\\n     *\\n     * Provide sprintf-style format (only %s is supported) and arguments\\n     * to provide information about what broke and what you were\\n     * expecting.\\n     *\\n     * The invariant message will be stripped in production, but the invariant\\n     * will remain to ensure logic does not differ in production.\\n     */\\n\\n\\n    var validateFormat = function validateFormat() {};\\n\\n    {\\n      validateFormat = function validateFormat(format) {\\n        if (format === undefined) {\\n          throw new Error('invariant requires an error message argument');\\n        }\\n      };\\n    }\\n\\n    \r\n* 2.4 Now paste that code into an editor and replace all instances of `\\n` with a newline and `\\\"` with a regular single quote.  You should end up with code like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n/** @license React v16.7.0\r\n * react-dom.development.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\") {\r\n  (function () {\r\n    'use strict';\r\n\r\n    var React = require('react');\r\n\r\n    var _assign = require('object-assign');\r\n\r\n    var checkPropTypes = require('prop-types/checkPropTypes');\r\n\r\n    var scheduler = require('scheduler');\r\n\r\n    var tracing = require('scheduler/tracing');\r\n    /**\r\n     * Use invariant() to assert state which your program assumes to be true.\r\n     *\r\n     * Provide sprintf-style format (only %s is supported) and arguments\r\n     * to provide information about what broke and what you were\r\n     * expecting.\r\n     *\r\n     * The invariant message will be stripped in production, but the invariant\r\n     * will remain to ensure logic does not differ in production.\r\n     */\r\n\r\n\r\n    var validateFormat = function validateFormat() {};\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      validateFormat = function validateFormat(format) {\r\n        if (format === undefined) {\r\n          throw new Error('invariant requires an error message argument');\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3. Compare the sourcemap code to actual source in `node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.development.js`:**\r\n```javascript\r\n/** @license React v16.7.0\r\n * react-dom.development.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\") {\r\n  (function() {\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nvar React = require('react');\r\nvar _assign = require('object-assign');\r\nvar checkPropTypes = require('prop-types/checkPropTypes');\r\nvar scheduler = require('scheduler');\r\nvar tracing = require('scheduler/tracing');\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Use invariant() to assert state which your program assumes to be true.\r\n *\r\n * Provide sprintf-style format (only %s is supported) and arguments\r\n * to provide information about what broke and what you were\r\n * expecting.\r\n *\r\n * The invariant message will be stripped in production, but the invariant\r\n * will remain to ensure logic does not differ in production.\r\n */\r\n\r\nvar validateFormat = function () {};\r\n\r\n{\r\n  validateFormat = function (format) {\r\n    if (format === undefined) {\r\n      throw new Error('invariant requires an error message argument');\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSource is the same, which is required for VS Code's debugger breakpoints and step-into to work properly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe \"sourcemap source\" has many extra blank lines compared with the \"node_modules source\". As a result of these whitespace differences, VSCode breakpoints won't work and VSCode will set focus to the wrong code line when stepping into React's source code.\r\n\r\nAlso, the \"sourcemap source\" is indented differently from the \"node_modules source\". This breaks columnar breakpoints in VSCode.\r\n\r\nNote that the Chrome debugger only uses the \"sourcemap source\" (and ignores the actual source files) so it's not affected by this problem by default. However, if you use a Chrome devtools workspace to actually load the on-disk source files, it's possible that Chrome debugging may break too.\r\n\r\nRefer to #6044 for screenshots demonstrating the impact on VSCode users. This issue is narrowly defined to highlight the root cause of #6044 (the mismatch in whitespace between sourcemaps code and node_modules code) without requiring VSCode to reproduce the problem. \r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nRepro is trivial and the problem reproduces with every `create-react-app` project so I'm assuming that a hosted repro is not needed. If this is a bad assumption, let me know and I'll post a repro project. \r\n FWIW, I tested every possible value of webpack's devtool setting in https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/. None of them worked. :-(\r\n\r\nHere's the process I used for testing on a CRA app: \r\n1. manually edit the `devtool` value in `node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js`\r\n2. `npm start`\r\n3. started VSCode debugger\r\n4. set a breakpoint at `ReactDOM.render` in my own code\r\n5. Repeatedly do \"step into\" in the debugger until it gets into React's code in `node_modules/react/cjs/react.development.js`\r\n6. By comparing to the call stack, verified that the debugger is showing the wrong line in the wrong method.\r\n7. Stop debugger\r\n8. CTRL+C in the terminal to quit the dev server started by `npm start`\r\n9. Pick another `devtool` value and repeat from step 1 @justingrant not sure if it will make a difference to this particular bug, but note that the config for webpack's sourcemap creation was [recently changed](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5060). That change fixes a different sourcemap related bug (see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6074#issuecomment-462087174); it might be worth seeing how it affects this one. not stale @justingrant the \"whitespace handling\" is because the CRA webpack config runs node_modules through a limited babel transformation to support ES6 packages after long and concerted demand from users.  The \"bug\" this issue relates to is actually another opinionated and deliberate design choice (#5096 by @Timer) which you can't get out of unless you fork or eject.  FWIW I think that options like this should be controllable without an eject.\r\n\r\nTo save you the hassle of finding it, this code is now [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/eee8491d57d67dd76f0806a7512eaba2ce9c36f0/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L429). To get this to work, you need to change two things.  \r\n\r\nIn the loader definition for node_modules change the value for `sourceMaps` to `true` ([here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/eee8491d57d67dd76f0806a7512eaba2ce9c36f0/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L429)).\r\n\r\nBefore the main loaders (around [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/eee8491d57d67dd76f0806a7512eaba2ce9c36f0/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L327)) add the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  test: /\\.m?js/,\r\n  enforce: 'pre',\r\n  use: ['source-map-loader'],\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is so that files in node_modules that have already been transpiled, and have source maps already, are picked up by webpack to show the _original_ source.  Remember to add `source-map-loader` to your package.json! This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

I can repro. I don't know a lot about this issue yet...but I'll do some investigation and report back here. The minimum font height in Firefox is causing the text in the screencast `.svg` to blow up.  ## Things to notice before merging\r\n\r\n- ~~There's currently a [bug](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7704) for which jest 24 crashes if it's called programmatically. Until a bugfix comes out, i've added `require('jest-cli/build/cli')` before `require('jest')` like [this](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7704#issuecomment-457699687) comment suggests.~~ This has been fixed in version 24.1 \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n- ~~The current version of `jest-pnp-resolver` doesn't work because jest changed the file names of `jest-resolve`. They already have the fix in their code but it isn't published yet. I've filed an [issue](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver/issues/4), but in the meantime i've created `pnpResolver.js` just to make things work.~~ Fixed in `jest-pnp-resolver` 1.1.0 \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n- Jest 24 comes with a new `setupFilesAfterEnv` option that replaces `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile`. It now accepts an array of files instead of a single one. I'm wondering if we should allow multiple setup files? I think (based on the comments in the issue) that jest@24 would fix https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2393 so it would be really nice to get this working. Config for typescript can probably be simplified whenever this lands (jest uses `babel-jest` for ts automatically and finds tests). And if `babel-core@bridge` is only here for Jest, it can be removed Just a side-note/reminder: Once this is done we'll merge in #4176. I don't get why `npx create-react-app --scripts-version=@latest test-app-dist-tag` errors out with `You have provided more than one argument for <project-directory>.` in Travis \ud83e\udd14  This is related to a recent change. I think if you swap the arguments it should work. Please try that and let us know if that doesn't resolve the issue. > This is related to a recent change. I think if you swap the arguments it should work. Please try that and let us know if that doesn't resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nIt works now but there are 2 more failing builds that i can't get my head around. Can you help me with that? It appears that it fails only with latest node This is super welcome for us, we want to start a monorepo project with CRA + Typescript + Jest, and we will not start until we get jest 24 working nicely with this dream stack :-) > It works now but there are 2 more failing builds that i can't get my head around. Can you help me with that? It appears that it fails only with latest node\r\n\r\nYeah we're having some issues with the latest node builds in Travis on master as well. `snapshotResolver` will also help those of us in monorepo setups.  ie different snapshot directories for each app that shares components... When are you going to merge this ? :) we kind of need it badly please ! 24.3.0 has been released > 24.3.0 has been released\r\n\r\nUpdated \ud83d\ude80  Anyone knows why the tests are failing? Maybe this works : https://stackoverflow.com/a/54258361 ? Does still fail.\r\nThe react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:\r\n  \"jest\": \"24.3.1\"\r\nDon't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.\r\nHowever, a different version of jest was detected higher up in the tree:\r\n/home/travis/build/facebook/create-react-app/node_modules/jest (version: 24.4.0) \r\n\r\nMaybe increase version of jest to 24.4.0 ?\r\nOr try https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6305#issuecomment-460173994\r\n I'll update today ;)\r\nIt seems that with https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/8094 we can remove `jest-pnp-resolver` as a dependency > Looks like we just have one failing test left: [/test/fixtures/issue-5176-flow-class-properties/index.test.js@`master`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/test/fixtures/issue-5176-flow-class-properties/index.test.js)\r\n> \r\n> I'm not exactly sure why it's failing but let me know if you need any help looking into it.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure how to takle this, it passes in my local machine (i'm on node 10.15).\r\n\r\nRight now i'm trying to debug what's happening on travis Aaaaand we have green lights \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Awesome, when can we expect a release ? You should wait for https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8088 No, please please don't wait anymore lol, the pain is intense here without this merged, you have no idea!\r\n\r\nI understand the problem with https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8088 , but this is a relatively rare bug that happens when you don't want to install watchman... \r\n\r\nHowever having jest 24 (which supports typescript more easily) in create react app is a big deal for many of us. \r\n > @loryman The `yarn.lock.cached` file in `react-scripts` should not be part of your PR. Can you revert that file? Otherwise I think we're ready to merge this.\r\n\r\nYeah sorry, just reverted it! > We're going to merge this as is and release it in an alpha of version 3.0. I've created a follow up issue to make sure we update Jest before releasing the final version of 3.0.\r\n\r\nNice! Do you have an ETA on this v3 alpha release ?

The problem still occurs on Node 11.10.1 This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Hey! I've just tried the steps outlined in the OP with the current [Yarn v2 trunk](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry), and it worked perfectly. The build won't reach stable until the v2 as a whole does, but I wanted to let you know that the bug got taken care of \ud83d\ude42   - Adds `-minimal` flag\r\n- Adds template without additional css, service worker or svg\r\n- Switches to functional components and createRoot\r\n- React dependencies @next  Perhaps `--minimal` isn't the right name but I think this idea does have merit. In my opinion, Create React App has two main audiences: people new to React who want an easy way to get started and more experienced developers who want to prototype an idea or try something out quickly. In general we focus on people new to React but this could be useful for more experienced developers. Revising the template to use functional components and createRoot seems like something we might want to do anyway with hooks and suspense coming soon.\r\n\r\nThis approach does have some issues. We would need to have a minimal template for JavaScript as well as TypeScript so we'd be going from 2 templates to 4. Installing the `@next` versions of React and ReactDOM might not be what everyone wants or expects.\r\n\r\nPeople have also requested the ability to specify custom templates in the past, which we've chosen not to allow. There are some technical reasons, as well as some philosophical ones but maybe it's time to revisit that discussion. Removed the @next stuff, happy to implement first class custom templates if you want. Also, re: template count, thats a toughie. In the past I've done things like have evaluated templates and file inclusion/exclusion lists, but it makes editing and reading the templates a real pain in the snooch. Yeah, I don't think we want to go down that road. We also don't want to maintain a large number of templates. That's why revisiting custom templates might make sense. It's been rejected in the past though. I don't know what the right answer is. I'd like to hear what some of the other maintainers think. As someone who maintains a fork of react-scripts so that we can offer a customized template, out of the box dependencies and pre selected options I love the opinionated nature of this template. My problem is that including it out of the box means more out of the box templates that I need to watch with each upgrade when I'd really just love ways to be able to declare side effects in certain key areas of the CRA lifecycle. I know my use-case is outside the current CRA ecosystem but the more templates that are added, the more templates we need to support and patch with each upgrade. CRA is a wonderful tool and templates seem like they offer a good way to deal with file or config differences but don't really allow us to tap into or customize in the init or prepare steps. Not a blocker for this PR but something to think about if more modes/templates like minimal get added. Preliminarily speaking, based upon these results, I\u2019d posit that a large group of users are wasting their time deleting stuff:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/ken_wheeler/status/1088567547811766272?s=21 Can `\u2014template` accept a (partial) npm package name? Like `\u2014template wheeler` would init with `react-scripts-template-wheeler`. \r\n\r\nI guess `\u2014scripts-version` does something like this. But in this case only template itself would be customizable.  That does seem like a good option. It would be similar to the `--scripts-version` flag but makes life easier for people who *only* want a custom template. Maintaining a fork of `react-scripts` just to customize the template introduces a lot of overhead. Requiring it to be an npm package would allow the template to specify its own dependencies as well. Yep. Let\u2019s make it happen? It could but I think that adds a couple issues:\r\n\r\n- The cognitive burden of knowing which scripts\r\n- the optics around using non official scripts\r\n- can\u2019t use cli opts to get docs about why it\u2019s wrong if it is\r\n\r\nMy point here is that create-react-app\u2019s purpose is to provide an easy starting point to create a react app. But when a large, if not majority, number of users spend their first minutes deleting half of it, then it\u2019s not doing the best it can, right? We can improve the default template. But this problem came up in many different ways. People *want* this feature. I don\u2019t think discoverability will be a problem. Someone will make a website with categorised popular ones. Think \u201cboilerplates\u201d but without the build config debt. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure we want this and it will be glorious.    (For you the only change would be `\u2014template minimal` and the ability to tweak it. :-) Ok, I\u2019ll update it to make template resolve from npm I'm excited for you to land your first PR in Create React App. \ud83d\ude02  Imagine all you had to do to launch library Foobar examples is to run `create-react-app \u2014use foobar`. It can be a convention. Redux will make a starter, MobX, styled, emotion, etc. And then there can be higher level curation. Someone said \u201cIn my opinion, Create React App has two main audiences: people new to React who want an easy way to get started and more experienced developers who want to prototype an idea or try something out quickly.\u201d I think there\u2019s a third audience ... experienced developers that build real applications with create-react-app and never eject. That\u2019s what I do. I want the benefit of future enhancements to react-scripts without having to maintain it myself. > Imagine all you had to do to launch library Foobar examples is to run `create-react-app \u2014use foobar`. It can be a convention. Redux will make a starter, MobX, styled, emotion, etc. And then there can be higher level curation.\r\n\r\nI would like this - been thinking a while about how I like the option selection enabled by Vue-CLI.  If you could default to \"minimal\" if a `--use` flag was passed.  Then say I want to `--use emotion,typescript,mobx` and have the templates add their stuff...  Maybe this is too much?  Does this exist elsewhere? It should also be possible to resolve a template locally. A solution could be to just check if the provided value is a repo url, local path, or,  assume it's an npm name as a fallback. That way you could do any of the following:\r\n\r\n`create-react-app -template  ~/Desktop/my-custom-template`\r\n\r\n`create-react-app -template https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts/template`\r\n\r\n`create-react-app -template cra-template-redux` So I'm all for custom templates too, in fact I've raised it with the other maintainers a few times - so this is great.\r\n\r\nI think we need to settle on a convention that makes sense. Personally, I prefer `--template` makes more sense than `--use` - as these will be templates.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we resolve in a similar way to ESLint configs, in that `--template airbnb` would resolve `cra-template-airbnb` from GitHub? That was my original thinking. The way we resolve `scripts-version` is similar to what @harrysolovay is suggesting. I think it makes sense to default to npm but allow people to specify local paths or GitHub URLs. Agreed, @iansu. We can use NPM/Yarn-style resolution, where prefixing with `file:` would to just that, as we do with `--scripts-version`.\r\n\r\nThe major difference I'm suggesting is that we add some standardisation (and make templates easier to find) by using a prefix, that users can omit when installing via `--template`.  With this approach, I could search NPM for `cra-template-*` and see all templates.\r\n\r\nWe could also adopt the same for scripts at a later date, but that's not for this discussion. I agree that we should use a standard prefix. @gaearon suggested `react-scripts-template-<name>` which might be better than `cra-template-<name>`. We don't really use the CRA acronym officially right now and I'm not sure if we want to start. Agreed @iansu.\r\n\r\n@kenwheeler, do you need any help on this? I have a lot of time this weekend to take a look... so I would be happy to pick this up, as it's evolved a little since the initial PR. If a template system is gonna happen, the `--typescript` flag should be removed in favor of specifying the TypeScript template (`create-react-app --template typescript`). @iansu a convention would be great but with namespaces or organizational packages like \u2018@jimthedev/my-template\u2019 it sorta falls apart doesn\u2019t it? @jimthedev agreed. No point in trying to create a template naming convention... especially since I'd imagine many users will create their own templates and reference it locally. Hi @jimthedev and @harrysolovay. In fact it can work - you'd just, as with many other tools, use `@jimthedev/some-template` - which would reference `@jimthedev/create-react-app-template-some-template`.\r\n\r\nI think many users will publish templates... and this wouldn't stop you from simply referencing any local module.\r\n\r\nI agree we could deprecate the `--typescript` flag with this feature. I've given this some more thought, and I think we'll want to require that templates indicate the minimum compatible version of `react-scripts` - `peerDependencies` should do the job.\r\n\r\nAnother thought - should templates be listed as dependencies once used? I can't think of a good use for this, but it would be nice to keep track of which template was used to initialize a project.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\ntest jest coverage \r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Windows 7\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5600U CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Yarn: 1.7.0 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.9600.19236\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: 16.7.0 => 16.7.0\r\n    react-dom: 16.7.0 => 16.7.0\r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.3 => 2.1.3\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nnpx create-react-app my-app-test \r\ncd my-app-test\\ \r\nnpm run test -- --coverage \r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40664502/51682716-5cb8cf00-1fe8-11e9-9ab2-e8642b13d6aa.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40664502/51683012-24fe5700-1fe9-11e9-9f80-ff8877dd08e9.png)\r\n\r\nActually, I had this problem last year, I could resolve it because I had Jest in Dev Dependencies, and it seems to be problematic. \r\nBut, now I have the same problem, but whatever the configuration.

I was talking about the .gitignore that `create-react-app` automatically creates when you run `create-react-app myapp`  Currently, `useESModules` only affects `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` (so the compiled code does not reference ESM versions of `@babel/runtime`).

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n I'd still like to see if this could be reviewed If you use `babel-preset-react-app` outside of `react-scripts`, like if you're building a component library with it, by default the `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` will add references to ESM files in `@babel/runtime`, which contain `import` statements. If you want to ship a CommonJS-compatible library (that is to say, among other things, a library that works in Jest or Node-based test runners), this is quite bad!  I have a question that may be silly, but I have tried the obvious solutions (Google, StackOverflow, etc...).\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have a variety of UI repos that are consumed by one another to form a complete UI...they essentially work as micro-frontends with a main \"housing\" component as it were. For a variety of these repos I've used `create-react-app`. An example of how these are combined would be like so:\r\n\r\n`ui-add-application` -> `ui-list-apps` -> `ui-dashboard`.\r\n\r\n`ui-add-application` would be essentially a modal dialog where the user imports something, in this case a custom application for use in the app. `ui-list-apps` lists all of them, and finally `ui-dashboard` is the housing component that consumes both and renders the complete UI.\r\n\r\nIn `ui-list-apps` we have something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nimport { App as AddAppDialog } from 'ui-add-application'\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n        // ...\r\n        <AddAppDialog />\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in `ui-dashboard` the same idea:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nimport { App as ListApps } from 'ui-list-apps'\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n        // ...\r\n        <ListApps />\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this question each of these were bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. These were initially created well over a year ago with ejected config as we needed functionality that wasn't currently supported at the time by `react-scripts`. In `ui-add-application` we set the `main` property in `package.json` to the main bundle file. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n\"main\": \"build/ui-add-application.js\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nOver time we've had to maintain this config, i.e. updating webpack, babel and so forth. Recently we've had the idea to re-clone `create-react-app` to use `react-scripts` and not worry about this extra tech debt. As well as benefit from code splitting and lazy loading. What's confusing to me is that now, with code splitting and the hashed/chunked filenames, how does one import `ui-add-application` into `ui-list-apps`? Before we had that main entry file but now we have the chunked output from `create-react-app`?\r\n\r\nEssentially, how do I, in an **un-ejected** `create-react-app` app import the module like `import { App as AddAppDialog }`... just purely for use in another `create-react-app` project? If this is possible without ejecting of course. Unfortunately the only way right now is to maintain your own config like what you were doing.  However in most cases you only need a default set of babel config to work.  I have a minimal example here that you may find helpful https://github.com/bugzpodder/yarn-workspace-cra  The [original issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5750) got locked for some reason.\r\n\r\nI thought that with Service Worker in place, this error will be finally gone. Unfortunately, in some cases, it still tries to load the old resource. There is definitely less of these errors compared to a situation before doing this.\r\n\r\nThe Firefox 64.0 is common for most of these issues, but there is some Chrome 71 as well, so it's probably not browser related. It's widespread over pretty much all major OS. \r\n\r\nI haven't seen any errors related to installing Service Worker.\r\n\r\nI will try to reproduce it locally soon, but I am opening issue now in case someone has an idea what might be wrong. > for some reason.\r\n\r\nWe auto-lock closed issues that haven't had recent activity What do you mean with \"it still tries to load the old resource\"? What kind of behavior do you have in place to prevent users from navigating through an older version of your application?\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the service worker didn't cache all the bundles, resulting an error when the lazy load is triggered and the chunk is no longer available on the server. Perhaps they are too big? See: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3882#issuecomment-359216165 > What do you mean with \"it still tries to load the old resource\"? What kind of behavior do you have in place to prevent users from navigating through an older version of your application?\r\n\r\nWell, nothing in particular. I assume that SW should cache the application as a whole (based on precache-manifest) and not to touch the network. Am I misunderstanding something about this?\r\n\r\n> It sounds like the service worker didn't cache all the bundles, resulting an error when the lazy load is triggered and the chunk is no longer available on the server. Perhaps they are too big? See: [#3882 (comment)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3882#issuecomment-359216165)\r\n\r\nI just checked, but none of the file is bigger than 2MB except source maps but those does not matter. The biggest file is like 1.2MB (vendor libraries I assume).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's actually really strange. I just noticed that there were couple of reports from last few days requesting a files that comes from latest release and are still available on the network. Yet this error has occured. The server is a completely static nginx without any sort of caching setup. It feels more like some sort of corrupted SW cache \ud83d\ude15  No what you are describing is correct. Maybe I misunderstood you but if you use a service worker users can still be on an older version of your application if they leave the tab open. \r\n\r\nIf the chunk is still present on the server it sounds like a regular network error. How did you gather these error reports? A scenario that\u2019s possible is that a user interacted with your app in a way that triggered the loading of a new chunk while they were offline, resulting in a network error.  If the SW has cached all resources properly, it shouldn't request network so it's unlikely it was network error due to being offline. It's kinda the main theme of PWA apps to work offline, right? \ud83d\ude04 Besides, if user would be offline, the automated report would not be even received.\r\n\r\nWe are using Sentry to gather automated reports. I went through them and in most cases, the error happens when a user is redirected back to the app after processing a payment by 3rd party site. There are some ugly query params in the URL, so after processing that it does `window.location.replace` to get rid of those. It seems that the error happens right at that moment.\r\n\r\nThinking about it, the replace might happen fairly quickly. What if SW is in middle of checking for a new version? Could that cause some corrupted state where it does not have any resources available?\r\n\r\nI will certainly try to repro this soon, it's very odd for sure. Have you made any progress on replicating it? I would be really interested if you can find some way to replicate this. I have not been able to get it replicated with any sort of certainty. The last week and a half I have been chasing down why the SW is sometimes loading old content even though I watched it in the network tab just download the latest changes. Its worked fine for over a year now and now for some reason some users randomly get the previous builds index.html which points to the old builds bundle when they refresh after new content is available. Its weird because I can see that its caching the right resources but that first refresh uses the old build's index.html for whatever reason. Subsequent refreshes it loads the appropriately cached resources including the chunks it downloaded. Its an odd one.  I think I'm having this same exact issue. However, the only time I see the issue is when I launch my PWA in standalone mode on an iPhone.\r\n\r\nIf I open my app in the browser on my phone, it works fine. But when I try to open in standalone mode I am faced with just a white screen. When I open the console I see that I'm getting a 404 trying to load a chunk, however that chunk is from 3 deploys ago...\r\n\r\nThe only way for me to fix this is to command + option + R in the developer tools on my mac, connected to my iPhone. But even then, on the next reload the issue persists.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: If this is indeed the same issue, I was able to fix this by manually deleting all the website data for my application on my phone. I'm not sure why this would fix the issue, but the command + option + R didn't, thats the only reason I wasn't convinced that it was a cache issue in the first place. I think you guys are facing some different issue. In my case, it's not fetching old content, but it actually tries to grab the one that's present on the server. For some strange reason, it ends up with the error anyway. It's totally possible it's a bug in a Workbox itself as CRA itself doesn't do that much. I still haven't got to replicate this, I am too swamped with other stuff. Hopefully, next week :) Okay, I can reproduce my issue very easily. After I make any changes to my application and deploy to gh-pages, the issue arrises. My app does not work until i clear the browser cache on whatever device I am using.\r\n\r\nI have tested this in Google Chrome and Safari - on iOS and MacOS.\r\n\r\nIf i should open a different issue to report this problem please let me know, this issue makes it impossible for me to push changes to my app as most users can't know to manually clear their browser cache.\r\n\r\nLet me know if there is anything else i can provide to help work on this issue.   <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes, I think so\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it.

Hi all.\r\n\r\nWe have created a CRA app and have persisted two versions: an ejected version and a non-ejected.\r\nIs it possible to support a web worker (runs every minute or so to check whether there has been a double login and subsequently force the logout of the first login) in a non-ejected app? We are dispatching the requests using Redux and in a previous version (using Webpack 3) it all worked fine but now we are getting a worker.postMessage is not a function error (we ejected and added the worker-loader plugin and the global: 'this' property in the Webpack output but no dice). We can get it working by reverting to an old version (using Webpack 3) but it houses a lot of dated dependencies and isn't PWA.\r\n\r\nBasically is it possible to get this working without ejecting? This is proving to be a real pain point and Webpack isn't exactly the most intuitive tool.\r\n\r\nThanks all - I really appreciate it :) Possible duplicate of #5886 Hi @JavaJamie, I agree with @dschu-lab. Do you think that will solve your issue? That PR looks like it's still needing some work, but hopefully will merge soon. Hi @mrmckeb, thank you for your response. We have tried everything but to no avail. There were also issues using \"self\" (unrestricted globals issue) so we created an .eslintrc file to override this.\r\n\r\nAfter further debugging it transpired that the postMessage function wasn't being called on the worker (or the worker was created but the scope was wrong) so instead of using a singleton to generate the worker (this may have been the problem) I just created a new Worker('logout.worker') directly and that was able to access the postMessage function. There are still some issues but at least the Redux action is being dispatched onmessage now.\r\n\r\nIdeally it would be great to use the web worker without ejecting (as we faced a significant number of issues with Babel, decorators etc after ejecting).\r\n\r\nThanks. AFAIK you can run  `npm i worker-loader` and load workers in your code via `worker-loader?some=options&another=one!./path/to/your.worker.js` unless there is a configuration to disable inline loaders. We tampered further with the configuration and managed to get it working in the end with the unejected app so we're incredibly happy. We opted to go down the route of using react-app-rewired and worker-loader as devDependencies and inside the worker file we disabled the lint checking using `/* eslint-disable */`\r\n\r\nIt seems to work flawlessly now as it did in our old version (using Webpack 3).\r\n @JavaJamie \r\nnow we can use `babel decorators` without ejecting\r\nby edit file `create.js` in `node_modules/babel-preset-react-app` package\r\nfind those code in file \r\n```\r\n// Turn on legacy decorators for TypeScript files\r\nisTypeScriptEnabled && [\r\nrequire('@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators').default,\r\nfalse,\r\n],\r\n```\r\nchange to\r\n```\r\n// Turn on legacy decorators for TypeScript files & JavaScript files\r\n[\r\nrequire('@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators').default,\r\n{ legacy: true },\r\n],\r\n```  Windows Os build/index.html not finding js and css files\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

It's been 2 months. @iansu all requested changes are made. Thanks @iansu. I just visited the webpage and don't see the docs yet. Is there a delay for propagation?  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nIn the `babel-preset-react-app` project https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js#L92 it specifically overrides the browserslist configuration and targets `ie 9` with `useBuiltIns: false`. I believe this should be revisited as a configuration option to avoid the requirement for most people to eject `create-react-app` to run it in production. It seems that the configuration would be much nicer if we could avoid having to include polyfills manually and instead use `browserslist` configuration with `@babel/preset-env` and `@babel/polyfill` to do the heavy lifting. Then you'd only need to import `@babel/polyfill` in the top of the index.js file (could be included by default with a sensible default browserslist configuration) and you'd automatically get all of the polyfills needed. If this idea is of interest, i'd be happy to submit a PR with the required changes. This looks to be related to https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6091 as well It looks like this was already implemented in https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5264 but never reviewed or merged and went stale. Please, please, please could we implement this, or some other way to turn off regenerator runtime in development?  Debugging apps that use async/await is incredibly painful with regenerator. @justingrant great point! I have horrible issues debugging apps with async/await code or generators. It\u2019d be much better to be able to disable regenerator runtime at least in dev. Some things I mentioned in a previous ticket:\r\nChrome devtools has good support for direct debugging of native `async` / `await`.  You can step in/step over in an `async` method and it stays with you.  With transpiles or \"callback hell\", you have no easy way to stay with your current async flow of execution when it goes over a continuation.\r\n\r\nIn any V8 derived environment, native `async` / `await` is significantly faster than transpiles.\r\n\r\nI believe these points also apply to `function*`, but I haven't researched that. @nmain it does also apply to `function*`. I use `redux-saga` in my projects and debugging a non-ejected `create-react-app` is hell if you're inside a generator function. It's unfortunate because chrome has native support for debugging this code if you're not transpiling and vscode integration works great. The tagline for `create-react-app` is:\r\n\r\n> Create React apps with no build configuration.\r\n\r\nso I can understand why the maintainers are hesitant to introduce build configuration. I think, however, that `create-react-app` should ship with a reasonable set of `browserslist` defaults that will provide the happy path during development and support of modern browsers in production. With the current `browserslist` configuration it's a sad path for local development and unusable for most developers in production. This is the first situation i've come across where I feel that I might need to eject or at a minimum add some hacky injections with [arackaf/customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra).\r\n\r\n Currently the workaround we used to adopt CRA was to manually run Babel with the desired targets and debugging turned on along with `useBuiltIns` set to `usage`. This spits out a long list of mostly correct polyfills required and we manually added them to our index.js file.\r\n\r\nIf we decided to make the polyfill generation respect the browserslist defined in the package.json, I think it would be less confusing. To me, it seems like you must dive into the code at this point to realize the browserslist is only used for CSS even though preset-env supports using it for JS plugins + polyfill too. Yea totally. Out of naivety I assumed react-app-polyfill was working like babel-polyfill and using the browserlist to determine what core-js imports were included.\r\nI was wrong. Then to my surprise, looking at the cra presets, useBuiltIns is turned off with the comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/8944aab66db901bac2f2b656848e43228104a3a0/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js#L90-L92\r\n\r\nI don't understand that assumption. If I'm importing babel-polyfill, I can still be concerned with bundle size.\r\n\r\n**A preset-env that respects user configured browerlist. I can't see the downsides there?** @duhseekoh my guess is that at the time this was done when `useBuiltIns` was in experimental status and they didn't want to risk compatibility issues. Since it's quite stable now it should be the default behavior. Maybe we should maintain a fork of cra that respects `browserslist` until this gets some attention by the core team. @esetnik Did you end up submitting a PR for this? It seems like an absolute no-brainer. Thank you @ianschmitz. This is going to make many devs very happy.  \r\nWe should remove `yarn.lock` and `node_modules` after create raect-app in monorepo. Why not just skip install?  Hi @xiaoxiangmoe, I know we're always trying to improve monorepo support in CRA - so this might be a good step. Did you want to put together a PR for this?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if `--skip-install` is clear enough as a name for that argument, I'm not sure what would be a better name though. Related to #5786 Thanks @miraage. \r\n\r\n@xiaoxiangmoe did you have any more thoughts on this? Did you want to pick this up?

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  While it's a smart rule to have, one of our small annoyances has been the `jsx-no-target-blank` rule. I work on a large project that makes use of `target=\"_blank\"` fairly often, and requiring `rel=\"noopener noreferrer` all over the place adds noise that I'm not sure is necessary for a dev to care about.\r\n\r\nWe created a custom component `<A/>` with the logic to add the attribute values whenever `target=\"_blank\"`. This works great, but it adds a little bit of overhead, and since eslint no longer sees it as an anchor tag, we don't get other possible warnings targeted at anchor tags.\r\n\r\nSo that's the background, here's the ask:\r\n\r\nWould CRA be welcome to the idea of making this security fix automatic via babel plugin (found [babel-plugin-jsx-target-blank](https://github.com/akameco/babel-plugin-jsx-target-blank)) instead of warning the user by eslint?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the implications of this (i.e. does anyone have valid use-cases for ignoring this rule? would it break their apps?), so I wanted to open it up for discussion before creating a PR. This is actually a pretty good idea.\r\n\r\nI have only two questions/concerns:\r\n1. As you've stated, could there be cases where someone needs to have target blank and not `\"noopener noreferrer\"`?\r\n2. By removing this warning, we do lose the benefit of educating developers on why it's important. This may not be important. Safari automatically adds noopener to links with `target=_blank` (https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/237144/webkit/) and other browsers are experimenting with it (https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4078). Maybe in 1 year, if you're building an app for ever-green browsers, these attributes will be unneccessary. Just something to consider. Well, `target=_blank` will imply `noopener`, but `noreferrer` will continue to be somewhat stronger (but can also be achieved using the `referrerpolicy` attribute).  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report? No\r\n\r\nI'm using CRA with TypeScript and followed the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript) to integrate typescript.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that `npm run build` does not fail when there is a TypeScript error in the tests. I noticed that the webpack.config.js ignores errors in test files. See the [reportFiles array](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L635). It would be awesome to report TypeScript errors in test files too so that a team can know if a change caused a TypeScript error in a test.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `npm test` should report TypeScript errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n Note too in the react-scripts-ts fork this was supported so those of us migrating to CRA from there would expect this. This looks like a dupe of https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5626\r\n\r\nOur current workaround is to run `tsc` as a CI build step. This will report type errors in test files. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  I don't think this is necessarily a bug, and may be related to the 2.0+ changes to transpilation, but...\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (I was using Node 10.13.0, if that matters):\r\n1. Create a new create-react-app project with `react-scripts@2.1.2`.\r\n2. Create two files: `src/es6.js` and `src/cjs.js`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// es6.js\r\nexport default ({ foo, ...rest }) => true;\r\n\r\n// cjs.js\r\nmodule.exports = ({ foo, ...rest }) => true;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run `yarn start`.\r\n\r\n4. Import both of them into `App.js`, one at a time:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport es6 from \"./es6.js\";\r\n// or\r\nimport cjs from \"./cjs.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of the Object rest/spread syntax is allowed in the ES6 module syntax but not in the CommonJS `module.exports` version.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, you get one of two errors, depending on whether it's the first attempt to build or a subsequent attempt:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttempted import error: './cjs.js' does not contain a default export (imported as 'cjs').\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't use the rest/spread syntax, and just use plain destructuring (e.g. `({ foo, bar }) => true`), both files work.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this has something to do with the dynamic `module.exports` triggering a different transpilation, but I'm not sure exactly what's happening. It clearly does get transpiled - if you inspect the built output, it's been rendered ES5-compatible. But the rejection of the rest/spread indicates that the CJS file is getting transpiled... less?\r\n\r\nIs this the intended behavior? Should CJS modules in `src/` have a different set of language features allowed than ES6 modules? If so, is there a point in the config where this behavior can be changed? Am I missing something obvious? No, this is definitely a bug. Can you file this with webpack and babel (both) and see what they say?\r\n\r\nDoes this work if you make the function separate and then export the function via `module.exports = fnName;`? Doesn't matter whether the export is a named variable defined elsewhere or defined inline, same error.\r\n\r\nWill file with Webpack+Babel, unfortunately I'm not sure how to give them a \"reduced\" test case given all the different babel configs and deps involved... Posted to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8613 and https://github.com/babel/babel-loader/issues/757 I created a repo demonstrating this issue as I was preparing my own separate bug report. I see now that my ticket was a duplicate, but at least I can share the repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/fritz-c/import-issue-repro @Timer I think this issue can be resolved by adding:\r\n\r\n`sourceType: \"unambiguous\"`\r\n\r\nto the `babel-loader` options in the Webpack config. Is there a reason not to do that? No reason, send a PR? I don't suppose there are any workarounds for this or does anyone know in what version of CRA this was introduced? We're trying to upgrade from 1.x to 2.x and this has made that seemingly impossible for us. Our problem is that we've got shared code that runs in NodeJS that needs this syntax. @TazmanianDI specifying `sourceType: \"unambiguous\"` in the babel-loader options seems to resolve this, see this PR: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6279 @veltman Unless I'm mistaken, that requires ejecting right? I did that and your suggestion does work. Was just hoping for an alternative.  Otherwise I get i.e. such output;\r\n```\r\nCould not parse tsconfig.json. Please make sure it contains syntactically correct JSON.\r\nDetails: tsconfig.json(19,12): error TS1328: Property value can only be string literal, numeric literal, 'true', 'false', 'null', object literal or array literal.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is misleading - especially taking into account that info about incorrect JSON is written in bold > Seems ok but in what case would this an error that is not related to syntax. What did your tsconfig look like?\r\n\r\nI've pasted in the error I've received - as you might see it's not related to the JSON syntax, but rather purely about misconfiguring TS.\r\n\r\n> Looks like a test is now failing\r\n\r\nSeems unrelated, I'll try rebasing.

I tried changing the eslint config in package.json but it didn't work.\r\n```\r\n\"eslintConfig\": {\r\n\t\"rules\": {\r\n\t\t\"no-unused-vars\": \"off\"\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI specifically leave unused vars so that when I return to the code at a later date I remember what I have available. Not currently possible to tweak eslint within create-react-app without ejecting.\r\nAlthough! There is [a way to override things](https://github.com/sharegate/craco/) which works well, in this manner:\r\n\r\n    npm i --save @craco/craco\r\n\r\nCreate `craco.config.js` \r\n\r\n    const { ESLINT_MODES } = require(\"@craco/craco\");\r\n    module.exports = {\r\n      eslint: {\r\n        configure: {\r\n          rules: {\r\n            \"no-unused-vars\": \"off\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThen change your `package.json` scripts along the lines of\r\n\r\n    \"start\":  \"craco start\"\r\n\r\nHope that's helpful!  Have same problem there...\r\n\r\n`import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\r\nimport faker from 'faker';`\r\n\r\nCompiled with warnings.\r\n./src/App.js\r\nLine 3:  'faker' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars\r\n\r\nWhat i doing wrong???\r\n Well @ManiakMill , you've imported faker but presumably haven't used it in the rest of the code.\r\nNot the same issue @Qrokqt please check docs https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor you could create `.eslintrc.json` in your project directory and modify rules as you want. @pavinthan   \"if you edit your .eslintrc.json file further, these changes will only affect the editor integration.

Thanks! Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks! @Nargonath @ioloie my 2 cents, as you can see on the documentation of [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-writetodisk-), `writeToDisk` accept a boolean or a function returning the path, you could make `WRITE_TO_DISK` to have the same behavior.\r\n\r\n`WRITE_TO_DISK=true` -> use default folder (`dist`)\r\n`WRITE_TO_DISK=<custom path>` -> use the path specified\r\n This PR has a shortcoming which is that the `public` folder isn't written to disk with each update.\r\n\r\nStatic files are loaded by the middleware upon receiving a HTTP request for the file. This means that this won't fix #1070 in it's entirety by itself. But it does put us in a much more manageable position since it's straightforward to use something like `npm-run-all` with `cpx` to look after the static files:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"watch:react\": \"react-scripts start\",\r\n    \"watch:static\": \"cpx \\\"public/**/*.*\\\" dist --watch\",\r\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\r\n    \"start\": \"npm-run-all -p watch:* \",\r\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test\",\r\n    \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\"\r\n  }\r\n``` @ioloie I agree that is not the best solution yet but it still is better than the current state where you have to rely on external tools: https://github.com/Nargonath/cra-build-watch The `writeToDisk` function doesn't return a `filePath`. It accepts one as it's only argument.\r\nIt's purpose is to filter which files should be written to disk at all, returning either `true` or `false`.\r\n\r\nTo support custom output paths would mean making Webpack's [`output.path`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-path) configurable which is a [separate](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1354) [debate](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41495658/use-custom-build-output-folder-when-using-create-react-app).  @ioloie Fair enough, LTGM. In the end I feel CRA should do the same that `vue-cli` did to allow customization of the different configs.

SPA (created using `create-react-app`), which is going to be served as `/auth`\r\n2. API, which is going to be served as `/auth/api/*`\r\n3. gateway, which resolves all the requests to the appropriate microservices\r\n\r\nHere is [a demo repo](https://github.com/PavelPolyakov/CRA-PUBLIC_URL-demo) I prepared.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nIn the current version of `CRA` the variable `PUBLIC_URL` is [ignored during the development](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).\r\nThe closest answer to the question `why?` which I found was this:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/commit/30ee52cf3b2cbb6ac70999c02b1196bcaba8d4ca#diff-a7f98c18479be87c9f33e7604dbd1a09L33\r\n\r\nwhich was updated by https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/commit/30ee52cf3b2cbb6ac70999c02b1196bcaba8d4ca#diff-dc0c4e7c623b73660da1809fc60cf6baR74 (@Timer)\r\n\r\nBut this is exactly what prevents people from developing `CRA` applications while being under the gateway.

Hi @kirill-konshin, I understand what you're saying, and in a way I agree with you - but I also think there are a lot of strengths in the peer-dependency approach. For one, it helps to eliminate issues where multiple versions of the same dependency are installed - which can cause problems.\r\n\r\nThe obvious problem with peer dependencies, which I've faced too, is that they can be outdated at times and even if the new version is compatible, you keep seeing errors upon install (which is annoying). The other issue which you've raised above is the optional dependency issue - [this isn't supported by `npm`](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3066).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the better approach is for us to publish a base config, and then a flow config that extends the base config - then you won't hit this issue.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on that? I agree, it does makes sense to divide packages (or configs) into a more granular set.  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Anti-stale-bot-ping ) Anti stale bot ping I have a project that is just a component library so I'm not using create-react-app but I wanted the tooling to be consistent with our CRA projects so using babel-preset-react-app and eslint-config-react-app is a great option (I really appreciate that they are published as they are). \r\n\r\nI did find it odd that babel-preset-react-app includes all of the plugins as dependencies and eslint-config-react-app uses peer dependencies.\r\n\r\nI admit that I could totally be missing the reason for why they are different, but in my case this change would be helpful. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n I agree with @kirill-konshin and @skoestler that `eslint-config-react-app` should mirror the behavior of `babel-preset-react-app` by including its dependencies as regular dependencies.\r\n\r\nI set up a project that mirrors `create-react-app`'s Babel and ESLint config and about half of the dependencies in my `package.json` are `eslint-config-react-app`'s dependencies. It would be nice to trim that down so that one could just add `eslint-config-react-app` without having to track down all of the dependencies.

Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and run `mkcert localhost`\r\n\r\n2. add both the private key and certificate generated by `mkcert` to a single .pem file (e.g. `server.pem`)\r\n\r\n3. add a `prestart` line to your `package.json` under `scripts` (assuming the .pem file is inside of a /cert folder): `\"prestart\": \"cp -f ./cert/server.pem ./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/ssl || :\"`\r\n\r\n4. start CRA in HTTPS mode: `HTTPS=true npm start`\r\n\r\n5. :moneybag: profit! :moneybag: http://oi65.tinypic.com/axmfyq.jpg\r\n\r\nSimilar discussions:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/430\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5845\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6544\r\n\r\nOriginal solution by @Zwerge here: [HTTPS In Development: A Practical Guide](https://dev.to/zwerge/comment/8bkj) For those who searching for command line example, use the following: (thanks @rlueder)\r\n```\r\nbrew install mkcert\r\nmkcert localhost\r\ncat ./localhost-key.pem ./localhost.pem > ./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/ssl/server.pem\r\nnpm run start       (HTTPS=true react-scripts start)\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, Chrome may block localhost https from loading. (at least for me recently)\r\n\r\nHopefully this PR will solve it completely later - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5845 idk, is this stale ... again?  I have fixed an issue that I found with `html-webpack-plugin` https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/1072\r\nAnd I have noticed my change is present in the latest `next` release of `html-webpack-plugin`.\r\n\r\nSo can we please update the package version for `react-scripts` to `html-webpack-plugin@4.0.0-beta.5` from current `alpha.2`? Hi @aftabnack1, that sounds like a good fix. Would you like to create a PR? If not, I could look at it this weekend. @mrmckeb please go ahead and take care of this. Thanks!

Can someone review and merge the PR?  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.18 Fedora 29 (Workstation Edition) 29 (Workstation Edition)\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.13.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.12.3 - ~/.npm-packages/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.4.1 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 70.0.3538.102\r\n    Firefox: 63.0.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0 \r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `npx create-react-app project`\r\n2. `cd project`\r\n3. `yarn eject`\r\n4. `yarn build`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild success.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild fails.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n./src/index.js\r\nError: [BABEL] /tmp/project/src/index.js: Cannot find module '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx' (While processing: \"/tmp/project/node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/index.js$1\")\r\n    at Array.reduce (<anonymous>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter eject, there's no `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` module inside `./node_modules`, `./node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/node_modules` or `./node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/node_modules`.\r\n\r\nI need to delete the whole `node_modules` and re-run `yarn` to make it work. I think this is expected. You need to re-run `yarn` after ejecting. @Timer No, re-run `yarn` doesn't help. I need to delete the whole `node_modules` and re-install all packages. I think it might be a bug in yarn package manager but I'm not sure. I am facing the same issue as well. I just met this issue,delete the whole node_modules, and re-yarn it to succeed. Fresh install this morning, seeing the same behaviour outlined above. For me that workaround at SO helped. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53327625/cannot-find-module-babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-source-when-running-react\r\n\r\nNevertheless a real fix would be nice :-) @Timer this looks similar to the issue we're seeing that is causing our Travis builds to fail.\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/facebook/create-react-app/builds/475444651 See [this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6174#issuecomment-456806323)\r\n\r\nCRA does not include this dependency when ejecting. \r\nYou'll have to add it yourself (`yarn add @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` or `npm install --save @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`)\r\n\r\nA proper fix in CRA will be better of course. > See [this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6174#issuecomment-456806323)\r\n> \r\n> CRA does not include this dependency when ejecting.\r\n> You'll have to add it yourself (`yarn add @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` or `npm install --save @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`)\r\n> \r\n> A proper fix in CRA will be better of course.\r\n\r\nI Fixed this ejecting issue by adding @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx. thx :) once yarn eject has been operated, `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`,`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self` and `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-source` are deleted I've just stumbled upon this too. My ejected setup missed two dependencies. Calling the below helped:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn add @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self\r\n``` I'm having the same issue. @LinkChenzy suggestion worked for me. @lixiaoyan Yep, `rm -rf node_modules && yarn` worked fine for me \ud83d\udc4c Me and @abel1105 did some debugging work over in #6679, but I want to move the conversation here.\r\n\r\nI don't have a solution, but I can consistently reproduce this. Roughly here's what's up:\r\n\r\nnode_modules after `npx create-react-app issue_6679 --typescript`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\n@babel/preset-react/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/\r\n```\r\n\r\nnode_modules after `yarn run eject`. Here's where we're getting the error. If you run `yarn why @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self` it will tell you that it's installed because `@babel/preset-react` depends on it. However, that package isn't resolvable from the _nested_ `@babel/preset-react` in `babel-preset-react-app/node_modules` just because of how module resolution works.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\n@babel/preset-react/\r\n+ @babel/preset-react/node_modules/@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/\r\n```\r\n\r\nnode_modules after `rm -rf node_modules && rm yarn.lock && yarn`. Everything works again.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n@babel/preset-react/\r\n@babel/preset-react/node_modules/@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-self/\r\nbabel-preset-react-app/\r\n- babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/\r\n```\r\n Good work investigating this. So is this a bug in yarn or something in Create React App? What happens if you create an app with npm and then eject? Yeah, it doesn't repro when I `--use-npm`, so I *think* it's a bug in yarn. I was using 1.12.3 but just reproduced using the latest version, 1.15.2. It's weird that it's intermittent for you because I can repro every time on my machine. Let's file an issue with Yarn then. Or see if one already exists. @arcanis do you have any idea what might be going on here? I was going to file an issue with Yarn but I'm not even sure how to describe this problem succinctly. I think I'm hitting the same yarn bug in a project derived from CRA but I get it with different babel packages depending on the test case.\r\n\r\nJust as here, running npm or removing node_modules and rerunning yarn fixes the problem. It seems like yarn does not correctly verify the existing package tree somehow. My current understanding is that yarn does not completely verify the package tree when running yarn for existing dependencies. Combined with the very special case of removing a dependency while at the same time installing its dependencies as first hand dependencies makes it possible for some previously transitive dependence to not get flattened and therefor be impossible to reach from packages that have been flattened (as previously discovered by @heyimalex and @abel1105).\r\n\r\nI don't know if yarn skips this verification purposly for performance reasons or if it's a bug. But as this case should be incredibly uncommon it might be reasonable to skip it by default. However none of the yarn flags that I expected to help (`--force` and `--check-files`) does help. What I would want from yarn, I think, is a flag that verifies if all packages is placed at exactly the same nesting level as it would place them at if there were no node_modules folder. > @arcanis do you have any idea what might be going on here? I was going to file an issue with Yarn but I'm not even sure how to describe this problem succinctly.\r\n\r\nNo idea, sorry. It's clear it shouldn't do this, though \ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\nEfficient node_modules diffing is pretty hard, and part of the reason why I don't invest too much bandwidth in node_modules at the moment. Unless someone sends a PR for the v1, this bug will likely be fixed as part of the v2 rearchitecture work, which will make PnP the default install strategy. I'm not sure what the timeline is for v2 but I don't think this is a critical issue so we can probably wait. If someone wants to send a PR for v1 that would be great but it probably won't be me. I am curious to try this out with Yarn v2 though and see if it works.  Webpack v5 is coming down the pipeline with some awesome improvements - is there any discussions or plans to get this in CRA when the major drops? https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases We can look into it once it gets to beta/stable.  It would also be a major version bump to cra (3.0). @bugzpodder - would it need a major bump? It's obviously not ready for us to use yet, but if there are no breaking changes for our end users, we could probably release as a 2.x version? Yep that sounds good.  I forgot that CRA already dropped support for Node 6, so it should be less of a problem. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n After CRA shifted to 2.x its deps are ok in keeping up-to-date.\r\nFor me, that's really important, and since then i stopped ejecting projects because of that.\r\nDeps to keep a close eye on are especially: Webpack and its loaders, PostCSS, and Babel.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you answered \"Yes\":\r\n\r\n    Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about\r\n    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.\r\n\r\n    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with\r\n    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.\r\n\r\n    In either case, please fill as many fields below as you can.\r\n\r\n  If you answered \"No\":\r\n\r\n    If this is a question or a discussion, you may delete this template and write in a free form.\r\n    Note that we don't provide help for webpack questions after ejecting.\r\n    You can find webpack docs at https://webpack.js.org/.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\nTypeScript module augmentation seems to be the main one, though i did search including the error code ts-1208\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9698639/50326123-7715ff00-04b6-11e9-9d04-6201a34d407e.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm installing a three.js plugin in a TypeScript project, unfortunately it doesn't have type definitions, so i have trouble when importing, tried to create a module definition with no luck:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9698639/50326235-38347900-04b7-11e9-80bc-7641106cecca.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9698639/50326240-44b8d180-04b7-11e9-9b2b-86544b7e60c3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9698639/50326338-d1638f80-04b7-11e9-910c-b625fea52c23.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9698639/50326358-eb9d6d80-04b7-11e9-8232-834b215f5d23.png)\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expected to import a random JS module that has no Typings definition & maybe be forced to write a simple empty definition for it.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI was trying to put flag `isolatedModules` to false to be able to define the typing definition but build process keeps reverting to true, which seems to block me from creating the definition.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\nAs soon as i have more time.\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can\u2019t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you\u2019re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause.

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  This PR fixes what I believe to be a very necessary fix for Jest configuration. https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/6042\r\n\r\nWhat it does\r\n- It adds 3 new keys to the allowedOverrides config\r\n- It gracefully extends any jest config option that is an object while leaving arrays and primitive types to override\r\n- Gracefully extending the objects made the most sense because it allows the original pieces to keep working as expected while give you the ability to fix things that would render the test framework useless for a project\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to update these keys for the following reasons\r\n- **moduleNameMapper**: I've worked on many many jobs and projects and have yet to find one that didn't take advantage of aliasing in someway. If a project is using aliasing (despite CRAs efforts to continue to block it?) it renders the test framework useless.\r\n- **transform**: adding any additional file types or loaders to a project will render this broken. Specifically here, I know people need to use `jest-transform-graphql`\r\n- **transformIgnorePatterns**: This is really the reason this PR was created in the first place, the above two items were just logical additions... If someone distributes ES6 / ESNext code and you are using it in your project, you can no longer use Jest. While we can promote in a perfect world that everyone ships ES5 code, first class browser support for ES6 is making this less true. Also, some codebases intentionally use ES6 code since it results in smaller end user bundles.

When clicking on a stack frame in the call stack that's inside `react-dom.development.js`, the highlighted line of code is wrong.\r\n\r\n1. Install VS Code 1.30.0 or 1.31.0-insider and the Debugger for Chrome extension version 4.11.1.\r\n2. `npx create-react-app debugging-test`\r\n3. Copy [the suggested launch.json file from CRA documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#debugging-in-the-editor) into a newly created `.vscode` directory inside the project.\r\n4. Add `debugger;` to the beginning of the `render()` method in `App.js`.\r\n5. `npm start`\r\n6. Hit <kbd>F5</kbd> in VS Code to launch Chrome and start debugging.\r\n7. After the debugger pauses, select the second-topmost stack frame (`finishClassComponent` in `react-dom.development.js`). Observe the highlighted line of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe correct line of code inside the `finishClassComponent` function is highlighted, like in Chrome Dev Tools:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"849\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-15 at 4 12 30 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/351598/50038241-0b9ae000-0025-11e9-9401-e0a6c7fca0ea.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible!

It's not about testing, and doesn't seem to relate to breakpoint location. Rather it's about the code reconstructed from the source maps being different from the actual source and the VS Code debugger being tripped by this. The problem can also be reproduced by calling some code in `react-dom` and manually stepping into it.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I tried adding the `\"disableOptimisticBPs\": true` option suggested in #5319 to `launch.json`, but it doesn't seem to be a valid option when `\"type\"` is `\"chrome\"`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can\u2019t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you\u2019re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause.

This bug makes VSCode useless for debugging any node_modules code, because you won't be able to step-through, use breakpoints, or do anything that depends on accurately knowing line numbers of code in the debugger.  Huge problem.  \r\n\r\nI did a brief investigation of the issue and here's what I noticed: \r\n\r\n1. As @jraiskila noted, the problem is that different code is at different line numbers between Chrome Dev Tools and VSCode. \r\n\r\n2. The difference in line numbers seems to be entirely caused by differences in whitespace handling.  The code is the same in both cases, but the code shown in Chrome has much more extra whitespace than the file stored on disk. For example, look at the top of the `react-dom-development.js` file in Chrome vs. the VS-Code Debugger (using the OPs repro steps above): \r\n\r\nChrome: \r\n```javascript\r\n/** @license React v16.6.1\r\n * react-dom.development.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\") {\r\n  (function () {\r\n    'use strict';\r\n\r\n    var React = require('react');\r\n\r\n    var _assign = require('object-assign');\r\n\r\n    var checkPropTypes = require('prop-types/checkPropTypes');\r\n\r\n    var scheduler = require('scheduler');\r\n\r\n    var tracing = require('scheduler/tracing');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's the VSCode version, which is the actual file stored on disk: (FWIW, this is also what you'll see if you use Chrome Dev Tools to open the react-dom.development.js file on disk) \r\n```\r\n/** @license React v16.6.1\r\n * react-dom.development.js\r\n *\r\n * Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\r\n *\r\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\r\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\r\n */\r\n\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\") {\r\n  (function() {\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nvar React = require('react');\r\nvar _assign = require('object-assign');\r\nvar checkPropTypes = require('prop-types/checkPropTypes');\r\nvar scheduler = require('scheduler');\r\nvar tracing = require('scheduler/tracing');\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. It's not just line numbers that are different, it's also intra-line whitespace. The on-disk file has less indentation than the code shown in Chrome. This is less impactful than line numbering, but I assume that this would break columnar breakpoints. Example:\r\n\r\nOn-disk: \r\n```javascript\r\nvar React = require('react');\r\n```    \r\n\r\nChrome dev tools: \r\n```javascript\r\n    var React = require('react');\r\n```    \r\n\r\n4. All of the above was reproed on a Mac. At first I was suspicious that the cause might be PC-vs-Unix line endings issues, but given that the entire software stack here including Babel, CRA, and Chrome are all developed on non-Windows environments, I doubt that this is the cause. \r\n This could probably be moved to the vscode repo. This is happening because the file on disk is bundled (and reformatted, I guess) with its new content included in the sourcemap. But the path for the file in the sourcemap is just the path to the original file on disk. vscode thinks it has located the real file, so it shows you the file on disk which has the wrong line numbers. This is sort of a longstanding issue and I don't have a good fix right now.\r\n\r\nA workaround on create-react-app's side would be to not do whatever transformations it's doing on this file, since they seem to only be formatting-related. The file actually ends up bigger as a result. But it's not something that CRA should \"have\" to do. Thanks @roblourens.  If this is a longstanding issue in VSCode, is there already a VSCode issue in GitHub that I can watch?  If not, I'll create one. \r\n\r\nWhat I don't understand is why Chrome's debugger doesn't have the same problem but VSCode does have the problem.  Is the reason that VSCode (unlike Chrome) lacks the ability, during debugging, to show HTTP responses that don't correspond to an existing source file on disk?  If not, what's the root cause?\r\n\r\nRegardless of root cause, it sounds like fixing this on the VSCode side is unlikely to happen soon, so it seems like the most logical fix is to, as you suggested, change create-react-app to  \"_not do whatever transformations it's doing on this file, since they seem to only be formatting-related_\". Especially if those transformations are making create-react-app source files bigger than they need to be!\r\n I don't know of an existing issue that covers exactly this so you could create one, but I'm not likely to make any changes here in the near future. From my perspective, vscode is doing the right thing and the sourcemap is wrong.\r\n\r\n> What I don't understand is why Chrome's debugger doesn't have the same problem but VSCode does have the problem\r\n\r\nChrome devtools only shows whats in the sourcemap. And if vscode thinks it has found the real source file on disk, then it uses that. I think that's the correct thing to do most of the time.\r\n\r\n> change create-react-app to \"not do whatever transformations it's doing on this file, since they seem to only be formatting-related\"\r\n\r\nI think this would be the best fix, but I don't know where to start looking to see what it's actually doing here. @raiskila @roblourens - I filed a new issue #6296 to simplify the repro by removing VSCode from the repro. Hopefully this will make it easier for non-VSCode users to reproduce and fix the problem! This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Not stale! Hitting the same problem here... facing the same issue here same here ! Hey!  I figured out the cause of this problem and built a PR to fix it. Full details about the problem and the solution are in #7022, but here's a quick TL;DR: \r\n* The cause was CRA configuring Babel with `sourceMaps: false`. This setting apparently causes Babel not to omit sourcemaps but instead to emit *bad* sourcemaps where `sourcesContent` (the inline code inside the sourcemap file) and the row/col mappings don't match the original source code.\r\n* Changing it to `sourceMaps: true` (and adding `inputSourceMaps: true` too) fixes the problem so that `sourcesContent` and row/col mappings will match the original source.\r\n* The problem was only showing up in VSCode (and not in Chrome debugger) because Chrome only uses `sourcesContent` which was matching the sourcemap's row/col mappings. VSCode (which uses the original source files if they're pointed to by the `sources` array in the sourcemap) was hosed because the original source didn't match the sourcemap. FYI @roblourens.  I wonder if VSCode should compare the source file to the `sourcesContent` content, and if they don't match, should show `sourcesContent` instead, so that even if Babel or webpack is misconfigured, the user will at least see valid code?\r\n* If you don't want to wait until the PR is merged and the next CRA release is cut, you can just edit `node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js` yourself-- it's an easy change. Replace this code: \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/57ef103440c24e41b0d7dc82b7ad7fc1dc817eca/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L432-L436\r\nwith this code: \r\n```javascript\r\n                // Babel sourcemaps are needed for debugging into node_modules\r\n                // code.  Without the options below, debuggers like VSCode\r\n                // show incorrect code and set breakpoints on the wrong lines.\r\n                sourceMaps: shouldUseSourceMap,\r\n                inputSourceMap: shouldUseSourceMap,\r\n```  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\ncreate-react-app replaces tsconfig\r\nuse typescript without create-react-app compile\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nWindows / Linux Subsystem\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. create-react-app todo \r\n2. cd todo\r\n3. yarn install\r\n4. add a tsconfig.json file and change files to .tsx\r\n5.

(seperate issue)\r\n\r\nI have solved this issue by just using tsc -w and compiling to js and jsx which react pretty quickly will hot-reload.\r\n\r\nThis has been working very well and i just keep the repo clean of js and jsx files via a gitignore.\r\n\r\nNow there seems to be no way for me to opt out of react transpiling my typescript code.\r\n\r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Hi @shavyg2, this is currently by design - and I'm sorry you've found the experience frustrating. I want to add that I'm using this in production applications and haven't faced any issues with the implementation being slow or buggy, but it could certainly be improved and we're always looking at ways to do that.\r\n\r\nOne option could be to keep your TS files outside of `src` and compile them into `src`.\r\n\r\nHow do you propose the configuration might look to opt-out? I don't know why it's slow but others are experiencing it too.\r\n#5820\r\n\r\nI fixed it-ish by doing this inside react-scripts in the webpack.dev.config\r\n```js\r\n// TypeScript type checking\r\n    useTypeScript && false &&\r\n      new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin({\r\n        typescript: resolve.sync('typescript', {\r\n          basedir: paths.appNodeModules,\r\n        }),\r\n        async: false,\r\n        checkSyntacticErrors: true,\r\n        tsconfig: paths.appTsConfig,\r\n        compilerOptions: {\r\n          module: 'esnext',\r\n          moduleResolution: 'node',\r\n          resolveJsonModule: true,\r\n          isolatedModules: true,\r\n          noEmit: true,\r\n          jsx: 'preserve',\r\n        },\r\n        reportFiles: [\r\n          '**',\r\n          '!**/*.json',\r\n          '!**/__tests__/**',\r\n          '!**/?(*.)(spec|test).*',\r\n          '!src/setupProxy.js',\r\n          '!src/setupTests.*',\r\n        ],\r\n        watch: paths.appSrc,\r\n        silent: true,\r\n        formatter: typescriptFormatter,\r\n      }),\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it's not so slow and i am able to use it.\r\n\r\nInterms of typescript it should either allow me to use my own tsconfig and never overwrite it.\r\nIf my config is incorrect and there is something that will definitely not work it should break and let me fix it, likely using something in the docs.\r\n\r\nMy app works perfectly fine, but some props are missing in documented places that are not needed.\r\n\r\nTo enforce typechecking at compile time is to agree that all libraries that can possible be used will have correctly define types across the npm/javascript ecosystem and therefore should be enforced!\r\n\r\n\r\nSeems too big of a statement.\r\n\r\nThis could be opt in and so could they actually typescript type checking using the .env\r\n\r\nThere is already one for SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true\r\nthis could be SKIP_TYPESCRIPT_CHECK=true\r\n\r\nthat way i don't have to change that to false everytime to get my project to compile.

This could be a hard one to reproduce, given it's Windows 7 (I have Windows 10 or MacOS only to test on). Would you be able to try again with a fresh install, by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx create-react-app test-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then eject, and let us know if it happens again? Hi @mrmckeb , \r\nI tried to repeat the process, but still received the same error. \r\nI did isolate the issue and was able to observe the expected behavior.  NPM is installed on my machine\u2019s C: drive and my workspace is on another drive (M:).  \r\nSteps to recreate the error:\r\nFrom M: drive, before ejection, I noticed that my path when running \u2018yarn test\u2019 shows the following path:\r\n```\r\nPASS  src/App.test.js\r\n```\r\nThen when I eject and run test:\r\n```\r\nFAIL C:/Users/usr/Scratch/testing/test-app/src/App.test.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I started over and \u2018$ npx create-react-app test-app\u2019 from my C:drive.  I ejected the app and tests works as expected, and terminal logs:\r\n``` \r\nPASS  src/App.test.js\r\n```\r\nWe seem to have an issue, with how the path is set during ejection.  I\u2019ve cloned the create-react-app to help explore the issue further for a possible solution for multiple drive support.  \r\n I have the same issue on Windows 7. Before ejection tests work fine, after ejection tests fail. It looks that jest does not see babel configuration section defined in package.json. As a workaround, I had to manually add  babel.config.js with similar content.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = function(api) {\r\n    api.cache(true);\r\n    const presets = ['react-app'];\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n        presets\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n``` Hi @piotrkl!  Your workaround resolved the issue for me.  I was able to have the test pass when the work space existed outside of my home drive (C:drive).  Thank you!\r\n\r\nI think this issue is still a bug as it should eject, with expected behavior.   You're right @mrLucianoii, ejection should not use introduce issues.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to raise a PR for this, that would be amazing. @mrmckeb I'll work on a solution for this issue and will raise a PR :) @mrmckeb I investigated the ejection process and could not find a better solution than @piotrkl   workaround--a babel.config.js file that must include api.cache(true) to reestablish a fresh configuration with a correct path to a directory workspace on a slave drive.    I could not find an api method available that could trigger the api.cache(true) during the ejection process.  Side note: This error also does not occur on slave drives in mac environments (tested the scenario out on my apple).  \r\n\r\nThe solution would be to include the babel.config.js file, where in the ejection process we can include a babel.config.js file only when its being ejected in a windows environment.  I'd use the fs module to create this file in such conditions and have this conditions checked for in packages/react-scripts/scripts/eject.js. As I don't have a W7 environment to test on, are you able to confirm the differences you're seeing upon ejection, vs those in other environments? If you can't, let me know and I'll chase up some test devices to run comparisons. @mrmckeb Yes, I'm able to confirm these differences.  I've tested the ejection process on multiple computers running W7 (here at the office), where in one case we ejected a cra living on our machines master drive and it produce no errors.  Then I created a cra living on a slave drive, on the same test computers and was able to reproduce the issue.    There are a few W7 machines where this issue does not occur at all. Everyone is surprised what is wrong with my laptop. I also discovered that on my laptop this issue occurs in cmd.exe but does not occur in IntelliJ IDEA Embedded Local Terminal (Alt+F12).  @piotrkl Would you be able to test this master/slave hard drive issue on those other machines, to confirm that the issue is not only our office computers? We have only one drive (C:) on all computers and this issue occurs on one computer only. On an affected computer I run the same command in the same folder from 1: CMD 2: IntelliJ IDEA Terminal. The issue occurs in 1 and does not occur in 2. This may suggest differences in environment or global configuration. @mrLucianoii Are you able to run it from IntelliJ IDEA Terminal for testing purposes? @mrLucianoii where did you have to place the babel.config.js to get Jest to see the configuration in the package.json? @khayyamsaleem I placed babel.config.js in the root directory of my project. @piotrkl I'll be honest, I've not used IntelliJ, but I do have it on my W7.  Could you clarify, 'run it from IntelliJ IDEA Terminal', should I that from a git bash configured terminal or from the default cmd.exe configured terminal? 1. Open IntelliJ IDEA\r\n2. Create a Project from Existing Sources (File | New | Project from Existing Sources)\r\n3. Open Termin window (View | Tool Windows | Terminal or press Alt+F12)\r\n4. Execute 'npm test' @piotrkl I ran the test, in IntelliJ terminal and CASE 1 threw an exception after `$ yarn eject`.  \r\n\r\nIn CASE 2, with a newly generata cra, its passed with `$ npm run test`.\r\nIn CASE 3, tested on a slave drive with `npm run test` and not `yarn test`, and it failed. \r\n\r\n**After ejection:**\r\nCASE 1 on master drive `$ yarn test`: **FAILS**\r\n```\r\n$ yarn test\r\nyarn run v1.12.3\r\n$ node scripts/test.js\r\n FAIL  src/App.test.js\r\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\r\n\r\n    [BABEL] C:\\Users\\usr\\inteli-test\\cdrive-inteli\\src\\App.test.js: Cannot find module '@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx' (While processing: \"C:\\\\Users\\\\usr\\\\inteli-test\\\\cdrive-inteli\\\\node_modules\\\\babel\r\n-preset-react-app\\\\index.js$1\")\r\n\r\n      at _pluginTransformReactJsx (node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/lib/index.js:19:39)\r\n      at _default (node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/node_modules/@babel/preset-react/lib/index.js:73:16)\r\n      at node_modules/@babel/helper-plugin-utils/lib/index.js:19:12\r\n      at loadDescriptor (node_modules/@babel/core/lib/config/full.js:165:14)\r\n      at cachedFunction (node_modules/@babel/core/lib/config/caching.js:33:19)\r\n      at loadPresetDescriptor (node_modules/@babel/core/lib/config/full.js:235:63)\r\n\r\nTest Suites: 1 failed, 1 total\r\nTests:       0 total\r\nSnapshots:   0 total\r\nTime:        12.638s\r\nRan all test suites.\r\n\r\nWatch Usage: Press w to show more.\r\nDone in 93.30s.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also observed my issue in IntelliJ on a slave drive.   \r\n\r\nCASE 2 on master drive `$ npm run test`: **PASS**\r\n```\r\n$ npm run test\r\n\r\n> cdrive-inteli2@0.1.0 test C:\\Users\\usr\\inteli-test\\cdrive-inteli2\r\n> node scripts/test.js\r\n\r\n PASS  src/App.test.js\r\n  \u221a renders without crashing (20ms)\r\n\r\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\r\nTests:       1 passed, 1 total\r\nSnapshots:   0 total\r\nTime:        12.854s\r\nRan all test suites.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCASE 3 on **slave** drive `$ npm run test`: **FAILS**\r\n_Same terminal logs as originally reported._\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nFor CASE1 I added a babel.config.js file and it did not resolve that issue.  CASE1 is not reproducible with vscode.  Let me see if I can reproduce it on another computer.  @piotrkl the error listed in CASE1, is that the error you observed on your machine? @mrmckeb This discussion has went quite.  I now see our issue as real edge cases.  A PR could be made where a babel config file is generated with a cra when a windows7 env is detected, but I'm on the fence if we should.  I'm open submitting a PR for it or just letting this discussion be a guide for those affected.   Sorry @mrLucianoii, I've been out for a week and half due to personal reasons.\r\n\r\nThis is tricky, and I'd encourage everyone to be on Windows 10 and using WSL whenever possible, but I also understand that some people don't have that luxury. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to raise a PR that's very lightweight, I think we can get that in.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nYes - local development proxy \r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. I was using an older v of create react app with scripts \"react-scripts\": \"1\",\r\n2. I decided to upgrade and use the latest \"react-scripts\": \"^2.1.1\",\r\n3. After the upgrade it seems that the new dev proxy is no longer works with my existing hrefs that used to work with the older dev proxy \r\n\r\nfor example I hade an href button that used to trigger google authentication flow :\r\n``` <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href={'/api/auth/google'}>Google login </a>```\r\n\r\nclicking this href used to hit my end point as expected : \r\nand I use passport/nodejs express on the backend and used to \r\nand that used to work in development mode and hit my end point \r\n``` app.get('/api/auth/google', (req, res, next) => { .... ```\r\n\r\nbut after the upgrade , which brought in a new v of the dev proxy . these hrefs are no longer hit the end point but rather staying on the same page\r\n\r\nhere is my proxy change in my package.json after the upgrade of my react scripts \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35621639/49926845-8976b400-fe8a-11e8-9de7-0678d03a7f3a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nclicking the href tag should behave like it did before upgrading the scripts / the dev proxy . \r\nmeaning it should be able to interpert the href /api .... and redirect just as it would with fetch requests\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nin development mode clicking the href doesnt get redirected to the backend server but rather stays on the client side and the react router tries to interpert it causing it to fallback to my catch all route '/'\r\n\r\n I have never seen proxy affecting anchor elements. Could you provide a documentation link for that? Actually After further investigation I think I know WHY is this happening : \r\n\r\nwhen I click on the href \r\nHere is the get request from the network tab : \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35621639/49967534-28ce9200-fef1-11e8-9e24-9db242c09fe6.png)\r\n\r\nif you notice Href click issues a Get request with Accept header set to text/html \r\n\r\n\r\nand in the new create-react-app the PROXY implementation says : \r\nhttps://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35621639/49967583-50255f00-fef1-11e8-81a3-009f7eecdb31.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was NOT the case with the older implementation of the development proxy ,\r\n \r\nso unfortunately I think I will need to change my hrefs and figure a way to do get requests to get the express/passport google/facebook auth flow working again \r\n\r\n\r\ndo you have any better alternative or suggestion on what may I do to handle this without needing to change the code much ?  Same error here, it still routes to `localhost:3000/api/auth/google`, my CRA version is 2.1.3\r\nIt seems `http-proxy-middleware` is the only working way. I have to [Configuring the Proxy Manually](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development#configuring-the-proxy-manually) Had the same issue with **href** element while it was working fine with other axios request using string proxy notation in the **package.json**. However, using **setupProxy.js** was able to fix the proxy issue for href elements too.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNot sure. \r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\nI have a pretty specific configuration, so User Guide isn't helpful here.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n`\r\nEnvironment Info:     \r\nSystem: OS: Windows 10 CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz \r\nBinaries: npm: 5.6.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD \r\nBrowsers: \r\nEdge: 41.16299.785.0 \r\nInternet Explorer: 11.0.16299.371 \r\nnpmPackages: \r\n@mdi/react: ^1.1.0 => 1.1.0 \r\n@types/react: ^16.6.0 => 16.7.13 \r\n@types/react-dom: ^16.0.9 => 16.0.9 \r\nreact: ^16.6.0 => 16.6.0 \r\nreact-dom: ^16.6.0 => 16.6.0 \r\nreact-scripts: ^2.1.0 => 2.1.0 \r\nnpmGlobalPackages: create-react-app: Not Found\r\n`\r\n\r\n### My issue\r\n\r\nMy app use my own NPM package, grouping some components.\r\n\r\nApp component declare the Router.

I have exactly the same problem.\r\nDo you have react-redux in both modules?\r\n\r\nIn my case I think I found the problem but I'm still trying to figure out how to fix it.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have two packages `module-main` and `module-base`, both have \"react-redux\" as a dependency but for `module-base` it's a devDependency.\r\n`module-base` is a dependency of `module-main`.\r\nSince both have `react-redux` as a dependency then there will be 2 `Provider` and 2 `Consumer` (connect) from react-redux, therefore when you set the value of `Provider` in `module-main` you are targeting that module's react-redux specific provider, when trying to access the consumer (connect) in `module-base` you are trying to resolve the context through the provider inside `module-base` instead of the main one.\r\n\r\nDid I get it right?\r\nJust trying to figure out a way to fix this.\r\n @SoaresMG \r\n\r\nYou should declare \"react-redux\" as a peer dependency in your _module-base_ package.\r\nBecause you want the exact same version of react-redux to be used in _module-base_ as inside _module-main_.\r\n\r\nSee :\r\n- https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26737819/why-use-peer-dependencies-in-npm-for-plugins\r\n\r\n\r\n Hi @afrz, I already tried that, but with it as peerDependencies when I use `npm link` or `yarn link` webpack will say that it doesn't recognize module X in `module-base` while it is declared in `module-main` Ok sorry, I \"skipped\" the symlink part..\r\n\r\nBut, I remember that all code in node_modules (including the linked package) is expected to be fully transpiled. So you cannot directly have  JSX components or ES6+ features there. \r\n\r\nC-R-A team can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe C-R-A does not support this scenario : having untranspiled linked package...  Yes, my understanding is that this is a dependency issue. Can you try using dependency injection here? Or, as mentioned, list the dependency as a `peerDependency`?\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for the slow response, Christmas workload got the best of me this week. @mrmckeb : Not sure what you mean by \"try using dependency injection\" ?\r\n\r\nAs mention above, I tried to list react-redux as a `peerDependency` in my NPM package, still the same issue. If you make it a peerDependency and therefore DO NOT have the package in the *linked* module, then you will not be able to find it in the package trying to USE the *linked* module. From googling, there is an option `--preserve-symlinks` when running commands with `node`... Should we explore that? @morgs32 : Oh, didn't know this one. \ud83d\udc4dDo you mean try to list react-redux as a `peerDependency` in my NPM package, then add the `--preserve-symlinks` option in the start script of my app ? Well I was experiencing the issue in a react app. I ended up configuring webpack to follow the symlinks: `resolve.symlinks = true` @morgs32 : I try to add it in `resolve` options of `react-scripts/config/webpack.config.dev.js`. \r\n\r\nStill the same. :( Indeed, I see in the doc that `resolve.symlinks = true` is the default for Webpack, so there is nothing to change about that. @fabienbranchel Try changing the `resolve.modules` inside `webpack.config.js` ([source](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L261)) from this:\r\n```\r\nmodules: ['node_modules'].concat(/* ... */),\r\n```\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodules: [path.resolve('node_modules'), 'node_modules'].concat(/* ... */),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will force webpack to look into your app dependencies first.\r\n\r\nOr try setting `symlinks` to `false` (not `true`) @arutkowski00 : seems to work, thank you !!!\r\nAny chance to make a PR for fix it properly ? @arutkowski00 Modifying `resolve.modules` to point to my app's`node_modules` first works for me. I didn't need to modify the `symlinks` setting. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d  @fabienbranchel @fortinmike My colleague created the PR #6207 @arutkowski00 : Tried the symlinks to false, it didn't works for me. Your first suggestion is the good one.

Doesn't this enable loose mode for all destructuring operations?\r\n\r\nThis can be very breaking and diverges from ES6 quite a bit. Instead it should only be enabled when destructuring from useState and equivalent. You're right. Do you know how I might go about achieving it only for known hooks? \r\nI thought there might be some option of specifying the known hooks in the plugin config somehow, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Ping @Pajn  Sorry, I completely missed the first notification.\r\n\r\nI'm not too knowledgeable with the babel plugins or AST but I imagine that you would have to create a custom babel plugin (based on the `@babel/plugin-transform-destructuring` code). Some pseudo logic would be: check that the RHS of the assignment statement which does the destructuring is a function call which is a whitelisted hook name (like `useState`) and if so transpile that statement in loose mode, otherwise use the full transformation. @eivind88 based on @Pajn's advice, I've adapted `babel-plugin-transform-destructuring` to take a whitelist of property/function names to apply the `loose` rule when destructuring.\r\n\r\nHave a look at https://github.com/lvl99/babel/commit/e2600c3e676506baca0e5e7cb9836e24f9c7ee8d and let me know if it could be used here.\r\n\r\nEdit: PR on babel available here: https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9486 @lvl99 Great!\r\n\r\nI've updated my PR; Could you have a look and verify that I've understood your change correctly? :)\r\n\r\nThis PRs dependency versions will need to be bumped after you PR is merged. @eivind88 I think since you have `loose` mode enabled on [this line](https://github.com/eivind88/create-react-app/commit/8dc1de4913e30db1cfe569176ab645a8d3a7e5b5#diff-7482288d6d13860f434d0b8171f20431R124) that it would always be enabled, even with the `selectiveLoose` values given, due to [this line I have here](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9486/files#diff-0b9a5c8ef24d0d2916ec64310eeb4e7cR242).\r\n\r\nPerhaps I need to rethink what exactly is happening or how we want to use it. `isLoose` would only be true if the `selectiveLoose` option is set and the checked item matches the `selectiveLoose` list, otherwise if it is false it will defer to the `loose` value (in your PR [you have `loose: true`](https://github.com/eivind88/create-react-app/commit/8dc1de4913e30db1cfe569176ab645a8d3a7e5b5#diff-7482288d6d13860f434d0b8171f20431R124) so it would end up running all destructuring in loose mode).\r\n\r\nMaybe my `isLoose` conditional should be a bit more _selective_, by returning a `false` if the item is not on the `selectiveLoose` list even if the `loose` option is `true`:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst isLoose = this.selectiveLoose\r\n  ? checkNameMatchesSelectiveLoose(objRef.name, this.selectiveLoose))\r\n  : loose;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that would make more sense!\r\n\r\nEdit: otherwise, if you set `loose: false` and then keep the `selectiveLoose` option as it, I think it should then run as we expect by only destructuring the functions that match those given on the `selectiveLoose` list loosely. @lvl99 Updated.\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here, considering that changes will need to be merged into Babel before this is usable? @eivind88 not sure! Maybe we could post comments on the PR and try and get others like @gaearon to help get it assessed for appropriateness and (hopefully) merged into Babel. @iansu Any thoughts?\ud83d\ude03  We are also going to want to add this rule: `\"react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\": \"warn\"` @iansu: Like so? Done!  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\nMaybe?\r\n\r\nRight now, I'm trying to use a component built with Angular elements and trying to import in React application, and use it as custom elements. I followed https://medium.com/@balramchavan/integrate-import-angular-v6-component-s-inside-react-js-applications-da5cc03107b4 <- this article.\r\n\r\nHowever, it works perfectly when I do npm start, which is to use development build script, but when I do npm build, which uses production build script by default, throws \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'ReactCurrentOwner' of undefined\".\r\n\r\nAnyone has an idea why that error only pops up on production build? \r\nThanks in advance. Hi @thisisgit, are you able to put together a quick repository demonstrating this? I can then take a look for you. Hi @mrmckeb, thanks for the quick reply!\r\n\r\nI was struggling with this issue until now and have found out temporary solution for this. It happens to work fine after downgrading react-scripts to 1.1.4 (haven't tested on other 1.1.x) and removing browserslist from package.json. \r\n\r\nStill, since we need to find out why this doesn't work on react-scripts v2.x.x, I'll create a simple repository that reproduces this issue. I'll try my best to create it in a day and post it here. Hi @mrmckeb! Almost a month passed and I finally made a reproducing repo of it :( Sorry for sharing this so late\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this is the result when built with react-script v2.1.2 (Check DevTool - console)\r\nhttps://test-web-app-bd61f.firebaseapp.com/\r\nGetting the same result from react-script v2.0.0\r\n\r\nBut when used v1.x.x, it works perfectly fine:\r\nhttps://test-web-app-2.firebaseapp.com/\r\n\r\nAnd here's the repo: https://github.com/thisisgit/test-react/tree/master\r\nYou can switch to branch, scripts-v1.x.x, to see the working one.\r\n\r\nFor the custom element, I've published a sample one in npm:\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/test-ng-elements\r\nAs mentioned in the header of this post, it's built with Angular elements.\r\n\r\nThanks again! Plus, I'm now seeing the error little different:\r\n![2019-01-04 9 22 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13231564/50688020-ec610280-1066-11e9-8b1a-2233ce3dbdda.png)\r\nSaying `r is not a function` from react.production.min.js:92 Hi @thisisgit, thanks for that. Can I ask for the link to the repo for the custom elements? Are you bundling this with something like Rollup? @mrmckeb Thanks for the quick reply!\r\nYup, here's the repo: https://github.com/thisisgit/test-ng-elements\r\n\r\nWhen `ng bulid` or `npm run build` is executed, it produces `runtime.js`, `polyfills.js`, and `main.js` in dist folder and I'm bundling these files to one using https://github.com/thisisgit/test-ng-elements/blob/master/custom-build-script.js <- this script. (has dependency on `fs-extra` and `concat`)\r\n\r\nSo to do these 2 works at once, building and bundling, execute `npm run build:element`. Then it produces single js file, `test-ng-element.js` in dist-element folder and that's what react app is importing and using. Hi @thisisgit, this is indeed a tricky one... I'm not an expert in Angular, which makes this a little harder.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things I've been looking at here, one thought is that maybe your script isn't initialising before React tries to render. An ordering issue feels most likely here.\r\n\r\nHave you tried just importing the three files - `runtime.js`, `polyfills.js`, and `main.js` - in the HTML file as the article suggests? That might fix it. @mrmckeb Just tried by importing those three files in index.html but still produces the same result :(\r\nDemo: https://test-web-app-3.firebaseapp.com/\r\nRepo: https://github.com/thisisgit/test-react/tree/scripts-at-index\r\n\r\nSince it worked just fine on react-scripts v1.x.x and started to produce this error starting v2.0.0, maybe someone who's involved in react-scripts library would have an idea what have changed on production build on that version. [Replied](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/28267#issuecomment-458739423) over on our end, but my suspicion is this is Webpack's global registry/runtime symbol getting overwritten (as there are multiple copies of the runtime being loaded, one from the NgCLI build and one from CRA).

Thanks! Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks! It would be nice if we could add a basic test for this, maybe in `tasks/e2e-simple.sh`. In there we test the eject command so it should be relatively easy to just run a command to verify that there are staged files after ejecting. What do you think? I think thats a good suggestion Would something like this suffice?\r\n`if [ -z \"$(git diff --staged --name-only)\" ]; then exit 1; fi` Yes, a git command like that should do it. I'm not a bash expert but I think you can do something like `test -z \"$(git diff --staged --name-only)\"`. That basically does exactly what your `if` is doing and I believe will exit the script if the test fails. We're doing something similar in the `exists` method in `e2e-simple`. I imagine if this fails it's not a big deal? Maybe we can remove the log info and wrap it in a try catch that swallows the error?\r\n\r\nAlso, we need the git detection before trying this right? That's a good catch @timer. Wrapping it in a try catch would serve as a git detection as well. \r\nI went ahead and moved the git add into a separate function & only doing the logging if it succeeds;  Please add the test that we discussed earlier.

Hey @gaearon! I really love this tool & would really love to start contributing to it. Could I grab this to try & get my feet wet with the project? Yes, it's all yours!  We need to remove the bit.ly links from the template because they point to the old README. We need to decide what to replace them with though. We could pick a new URL shortner but we could wind up in this situation again. Some allow you to change link destinations but who would own that account?\r\n\r\nFollow up to: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5808.\r\nRelated: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5536 As discussed in the previous thread. I prefer firebase page.link dynamic links which would generate shortened links like https://cra.page.link/docs and allows us change the target destination as well. I am open to transferring it to a maintainer once we agree on what to do. I somehow missed that suggestion in the previous thread. Seems like an okay option. Depending on anything Google related long-term worries me a bit though.\r\n\r\nWhat would be really great is if Docusaurus supported shortlinks/aliases and we could use those instead. That combined with a custom URL for Create React App would be really nice. Not sure how feasible that is though. Docusaurus supporting this natively would be best and that could be taken upstream and would take a while if they decide to add that.\r\n\r\nThought of getting create-react.app and createreact.app but they are both taken. Yeah, @Timer and I noticed createreact.app was taken. Sad that neither of them are being used. A bunch of other CRA related domains are also being squatted. \ud83d\ude1e  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n We could use Netlify's `__redirects` file to do the short links similar to @kentcdodds [netlify-shortener](https://github.com/kentcdodds/netlify-shortener)\r\n\r\nThis would give us\r\n\r\n1. The benefit of already using Netlify for the docs builds\r\n2. Full control over the URLs\r\n\r\nThe [usage is rather simple](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/), a `__redirects` file in the root redirects (with 301s or 302) or rewrites relative and absolute URLs according to the specification that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/cra             /create-react-app\r\n/cra2           /foobar 302\r\n/fOb             https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor\r\n/google          https://www.google.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nonly thing missing would be the domain name :)\r\n I think this is a pretty good option, provided we get our own domain name.

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n  I'm using the newest versions of create-react-app and react-scripts.\r\n\r\nFor a fully functional offline PWA, I would need to cache network requests to show some data while the user is offline, Most tutorials I saw were listening to the fetch event in the service-worker itself using self.addEventListener, but since CRA uses workbox-plugin to autogenerate the service worker as a developer I don't have access to \"self\" so I can't freely listen to the fetch event.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I did something like this to cache my get requests..\r\n```\r\nfunction cachedGet (url, config) {\r\n  return Promise.race([\r\n    getFromCacheAfter4Seconds(url, config),\r\n    getFromNetworkAndSaveToCache(url, config)\r\n  ])\r\n    .catch(error => {\r\n      console.error('error', error)\r\n      return getFromCacheAfter4Seconds(url, config)\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getFromCacheAfter4Seconds (url, config) {\r\n  const cacheKey = url.split('?')[0]\r\n\r\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n    let timeout = setTimeout(() => {\r\n      clearTimeout(timeout)\r\n      const cachedResponse = window.localStorage.getItem(cacheKey)\r\n      if (cachedResponse) {\r\n        const response = JSON.parse(cachedResponse)\r\n        console.log('getting from cache', url)\r\n        console.log('cachedResponse', response)\r\n        resolve(response)\r\n      } else {\r\n        console.log('no cached response found falling back to network', url)\r\n        getFromNetworkAndSaveToCache(url, config)\r\n          .then(resolve)\r\n      }\r\n    }, 4000)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getFromNetworkAndSaveToCache (url, config) {\r\n  const cacheKey = url.split('?')[0] // For requests that use a startDate & endDate parameters\r\n  return axios.get(url, config)\r\n    .then(res => res.data)\r\n    .then(data => {\r\n      window.localStorage.setItem(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(data))\r\n      return data\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nor to avoid calling the setTimeout anyway whenever Promise.race() is called I did something like this\r\n```\r\nfunction cachedGet (url, config) {\r\n  return getFromNetworkAndSaveToCache(url, config)\r\n    .catch(error => {\r\n      if (!error.status) {\r\n        // Network error\r\n        return getFromCacheAfter4Seconds(url, config)\r\n      } else {\r\n        throw error\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs there a better/ more recommended way? perhaps a configuration file I can use to specify cache-first vs offline-first vs whichever is faster? Same thing if I were to use other service worker features like background sync and/or push notifications. You can do this if you set `runtimeCaching` option in webpack config, or use `InjectManifest` plugin instead of `GenerateSW` which CRA currently uses. Both of those don't seem possible without forking react-scripts or ejecting. I think the optimal solution here is not using CRA's service worker and just using workbox directly. It's always loaded from CDN anyway. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

I learned a lot about how little I know ;-)  Resolves #5677.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested by running:\r\n```\r\nnpx git+ssh://git@github.com:mrmckeb/create-react-app.git#cra \\\r\n  test-app \\\r\n  --scripts-version=git+ssh://git@github.com:mrmckeb/create-react-app.git#react-scripts-typescript  \\\r\n  --typescript\r\n``` Just tested it. Works like a charm.\r\nWould it be a good idea to put a comment on how to enable it? Hi @amshtemp, thanks for the feedback. Do you mean a comment in documentation? Or a comment in command line on how to use it with your IDE (mostly VSCode)? \r\n\r\nPossibly docs, then linking to those docs from the command line? @mrmckeb,\r\nI don't know about the command line thing... isn't that a bit invasive?\r\nI guess the docs is a better place, with cross referencing between the IDE and CSS Modules sections.\r\n\r\nMaybe a better Idea is to have VSCode team adopt this. Do you think there is a chance? I'm asking because MS use their own CSS language server and this module fit that task well. Docs would make sense. I understand what you're saying, but this solution works in all IDEs that support TypeScript, it's not related to VSCode.   Fixes #3113.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, there is no downside to adding `{ wait: false }` to the option args when invoking opn, if someone can think of one then I'm happy to test that path.\r\n\r\nAdding `wait : false` adds `cpOpts.stdio = 'ignore';` and `cpOpts.detached = true;` to the `childProcess.spawn` [option object](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_options_detached). see [the relevant opn code](https://github.com/sindresorhus/opn/blob/master/index.js#L60)\r\n\r\nTesting on Ubuntu before the change:\r\n\r\n- With no browser open: starting react-scripts/start.js via yarn or npm then terminating the process via `<Ctrl>c` would also terminate the browser session\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n- With no browser open: starting react-scripts/start.js via yarn or npm then terminating the process via `<Ctrl>c` does not terminate the browser session.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #3113 for me on Ubuntu and causes no regressions on macOS Mojave (where I was unable to replicate the issue due to it not using `xdg-open`) Didn't get a chance to test on Windows so would be nice if someone else could give that a go.)

However, if the browser instance already exists and CRA isn't responsible for creating the initial session, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nHope this answers your query! I've tested both starting from no browser open and starting with the browser already open on:\r\n\r\nMacOS:\r\n- OS: Mojave 10.14\r\n- Yarn: 1.15.2\r\n- CRA: 2.1.8\r\n- Chrome: 74.0.3729.6 dev\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n- OS: 10 Home 64-Bit (10.0, Build 17134)\r\n- Yarn: 1.15.2\r\n- CRA: 2.1.8\r\n- Chrome: 72.0.3626.121\r\n  This resolves an issue where a package name may not reflect a git repository name when using a custom react scripts package (`--scripts-version`). By default, CRA uses the repository name which causes it to throw an error when a package is installed like the below:\r\n```\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@test/react-scripts\": \"git+ssh://git@github.com:mrmckeb/create-react-app.git#react-scripts\",\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test this fix, I've created an example repository here, and tested locally with the following command, where my package is named `@test/react-scripts`.\r\n```sh\r\nnpx git+ssh://git@github.com:mrmckeb/create-react-app.git#cra \\\r\n  test-app \\\r\n  --scripts-version=git+ssh://git@github.com:mrmckeb/create-react-app.git#react-scripts\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked well. It installed correctly, using the package name I had defined.\r\n\r\nI'm of course open to a better way of solving this!

Hi, want this feature to be merged very much! ping @iansu @kjin is there temporary fix to solve this issue? @zeeshancb This is probably as \"temporary\" as it gets, it papers over a problem that really lies in the usage of certain modules -- as HTTP2 is not implemented in the browser, if you're using a module that depends on it, either (a) you should not be using it or (b) the module authors themselves should be taking steps to making their module web-compatible, whether that means conditionally requiring `http2` or something more involved.

For example, if they type `styles.foo` they have no idea if `.foo` actually exists in the CSS module without manually checking the file.\r\n\r\n_**This is not a great TypeScript experience.**_\r\n\r\nI propose adding the [`css-modules-typescript-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-modules-typescript-loader) (or something similar) to emit type declarations for CSS modules on the fly.\r\n\r\nIt could be as simple as this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  const loaders = [\r\n    require.resolve('style-loader'),\r\n    ...(useTypeScript && cssOptions.modules\r\n      ? require.resolve('css-modules-typescript-loader')\r\n      : []\r\n    ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I'd love to see a more formal proposal put together for this.\r\n\r\nA couple things:\r\n\r\n1. This file shouldn't be seen by the user, it's unnecessary diff noise\r\n1. It needs to happen as a preloader on CSS Module files\r\n1. Gain a better understanding of caveats, I believe we opted against this initially.\r\n\r\n/cc @brunolemos @ianschmitz  1. It would be excellent if it could be transparently generated, but the file _has_ to be there in order for the TypeScript compiler to understand the structure of the CSS module, so what do you think about adding `*.module.d.ts` files to the project root's `.gitignore` to clean up the diffs?\r\n1. Ideally, it would actually happen on file save of the `*.module.css` file, so maybe this is more of a \"Run on Save\" command? Otherwise, when you switch from the CSS module to the TypeScript file that imports it, it will still be blind.\r\n1. I'd love to know the reasons for which y'all opted against this functionality. 1. It can be hidden away in `node_modules` or something, no?\r\n1. Run on save couldn't be safely configured, IMO. Thus the preloader. 1. No. Pretty sure it _has_ to be adjacent to the file in question and it has to have the same file name as the CSS module, so if the CSS module is named `foo.module.css` the definition file needs to be named `foo.d.ts`.\r\n1. I agree that would be a tough sell. Not sure what you're envisioning for the preloader, but I'm thinking that probably won't work. 1. We can try both ways.\r\n1. Look at our ESLint loader config, will happen *on save* while dev server is running and consequently *before* type checking. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 would be a better option, I agree. I don't think most people want to see this generated file. Could this be implemented as a plugin to TypeScript? It would be great if this happened in-memory, as opposed to needing written files.\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin @mrmckeb yes like [`css-module-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-module-types). Would a PR be accepted to CRA with this behavior? Wow, that's rad! The lack of maintenance/use is a little concerning. @Timer, I totally agree. Be nice to see [some tests](https://github.com/timothykang/css-module-types/issues/1) too. Internally, it looks like it's just a PostCSS plugin, which is a pretty good way of going about it. Right now I'm just using the vscode [css-modules extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=clinyong.vscode-css-modules). It works pretty well but won't warn you for invalid styles. The glory of this feature request is that it would work in any TypeScript-supported editor. @jamsch do you mean it doesn't warn you if you attempt to use a class name that isn't defined in the CSS module file? @jedmao, if we don't get a response on `css-module-types` this week, I'll fork the project and add take ownership/responsibility.\r\n- Add tests\r\n- Add support for SCSS @mrmckeb when you say SCSS support are you talking about nesting, specifically? Correct, @jedmao. It also looks like the module specifically targets CSS (*.CSS). Simple enough with postcss-nested. Should we target `*\\.module\\.[ps]?css`? Really, the target should be configurable. I think anything that CRA supports. For now it seems that it supports `*.(sc|sa|c)ss`. Just to be clear, we would only ever want this functionality to activate when a CSS Module, specifically, is imported, so checking for `module` in the file name is relevant for CRA, as that's how it supports CSS Modules. Of course ;) I just omitted that in my example.\r\n\r\nI've set some time aside on Saturday to work on this if everyone is OK with what we've discussed?\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, the current plan is:\r\n- Support for all supported formats `*\\.module\\.(sc|sa|c)ss`\r\n- Tests for the plugin\r\n- Only add the plugin when CSS modules are in use (I'll need to investigate this)\r\n- Update docs\r\n\r\nLet me know what else is needed. @mrmckeb in response to bullet point 3\ufe0f\u20e3, you're looking for `useTypeScript && cssOptions.modules`, as referenced [in the OP](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5677#issue-376601260).\r\n\r\nAnother thing I want to point out that [`css-modules-types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-module-types) repeatedly does this thing where it [hijacks built-in ts functions with named args](https://github.com/timothykang/css-module-types/blob/84a731c9d2370dd2549b6270ce0e947b6deceeac/index.ts#L29) and then [calls the original function with those specific args](https://github.com/timothykang/css-module-types/blob/84a731c9d2370dd2549b6270ce0e947b6deceeac/index.ts#L33). I think it would be better to pass any/all incoming args `...args: any[]` directly to the original ts function (i.e., `ts.originalFunction(...args)`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst originalFoo = ts.foo;\r\nts.foo = (...args) => {\r\n    const [ first, second ] = args;\r\n    // do stuff with `first` and `second`, the only args I'm using\r\n    originalFoo(...args);\r\n};\r\n``` @jedmao Just an update, I made a start on this over the weekend but need a little more time. I'm hoping to find a streamlined approach. I'll also use plugin options to allow us to limit it's use in this project. Question - Why does this need to be limited to *.modules.(sc|sa|c)ss files only? If a normal css file is imported with `:local(.className)` definitions, webpack class name rewriting still occurs (at least in Webpack 3 - we haven't tested 4 yet) and the typescript code still needs to be able to access `styles.className`.\r\n\r\nWe've been using [typed-css-modules](https://github.com/Quramy/typed-css-modules) to autogenerate *.css.d.ts files from *.css files with react-scripts-ts 2.16 (and many prior versions) for more than a year now, and appears to be an attempt to solve the same issue (though with the downside that the generated files are added to git too). Is there some restriction in Webpack 4 that breaks the `:local()` scoping of a css class declaration? If not - why is module-only css filenaming being forced for something that should be applicable to either? Hi @dawnmist, we're aligning with the in-built CRA 2.0 behaviour - which requires `*.module.*`. Changing that behaviour would be a different discussion.\r\n\r\nI have also tried `typed-css-modules`, but I think that this solution should be preferable to everyone as it doesn't actually require files to be generated and stored - instead, it happens in-memory. Please let us know if you see any disadvantages with this approach. The only disadvantage I can think of is the scenario in which you actually _want_ to generate/store the `.d.ts` files, because you're creating a component library of sorts. You don't want to supply any actual styles, but you do want to define what classes the styles should have in them? Sounds like an edge case though. You can also define your component styles in an interface within the component. @mrmckeb CRA 2.0 still supports *.css files, and the documentation still refers to *.css files as being able to be imported. I'd believed that the new css-modules support was an _added_ feature to CRA 2.0 rather than either a _moved_ feature or representing a _removed_ feature. Is this not the case? If the `:local(.className)` syntax is no longer supported in *.css files (as it _had been_ previously in CRA 1.x with `css-loader`) it means that in order to update we'll have somewhere in the vicinity of 200+ *.css files that will need to be renamed and have the `:local` syntax removed from every definition within them in order to move forward. This requirement certainly _wasn't_ listed in the breaking changes for CRA in any 2.0+ releases (which it should have been if there was a major removal of supported syntax). If the `:local(.className)` syntax isn't removed, then using it in a *.css file would still be in-built CRA behaviour (as it always was). It was only the generation of types that wasn't in-built previously (as CRA has only _very_ recently added any official typescript support at all). Css-modules enable you to leave out the `:local` scoping for classes as they get loaded as local by default...but I didn't think it was intended that anyone already using CRA prior to 2.0 would be forced to migrate to using the module file definition if they were already using the scoped definitions available/supported previously before they could update to CRA 2.0+. You're right, @dawnmist `*.css` is still supported. However, CSS modules (importing an object) need to have `*.module.*`. This is the new CRA 2.0 behaviour.\r\n\r\nSee here for more information on how this works: \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/30ee52cf3b2cbb6ac70999c02b1196bcaba8d4ca/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L454\r\n\r\nI've also used `*.css`, and not `*.module.css`, but for me it wasn't a deal-breaker to rename files. You'll be able to run a bulk script in bash or your IDE to update file names and it would be a very quick change.\r\n\r\nThere are many great things that came with CRA 2.0, and the TS support in 2.1+ is an amazing addition. Don't forget you can also create your own fork of `react-scripts` (as we did) and customise the webpack config a little - in this case you could remove the requirement for `*.module.*` for your project :)\r\n\r\nIf you think this is something you'd like to see changed in CRA, you could open an issue for that discussion and your proposal to improve it. I think you'd get some support behind your thinking. Hi @jedmao and @Timer, I've completed the plugin and wanted to get your thoughts on it. I need to:\r\n- Write some E2E tests (it has basic coverage now).\r\n- Improve docs (for example VSCode has an option to add the plugin via VSCode's settings).\r\n\r\nYou can find it here:\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-plugin-css-modules\r\n\r\nThis weekend I'll create a PR for `create-react-app` with this included. @mrmckeb nice work, does this support named imports such as:\r\n\r\n```js \r\nimport { className } from './styles.module.css'\r\n```\r\n? @fmal see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5677#issuecomment-438172085 @fmal Originally it did, but it was removed in favour of supporting classes with hyphens. Both could be supported, but I'm worried about a confusing developer experience.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like, raise an issue and we can discuss how it could be implemented ;) @mrmckeb i see, supporting hyphenated classes is a valid reason to have single export and i get your point on confusing developer experience \ud83d\udc4d  @jedmao @Timer I'm struggling to work out the best path forward here.\r\n\r\nWhen `create-react-app` is installed, and `react-scripts`'s `init` script is executed, there is no way to know that a user wants to use CSS modules. We can infer that they want to use TypeScript if they use `--typescript`.\r\n\r\n*Options*\r\nWe can detect if a user is using CSS modules during `react-scripts`'s `start` script - in the same way that we check if the user has `*.(ts|tsx)` a files present - and that's where I've gotten to. At this stage, we can do one of the following:\r\n1. Simply notify the user about the plugin, and how they can install it ([as it works for TypeScript now if not installed](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/5cdf36024635f58e2f36bd796dc36096c2f57191/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/verifyTypeScriptSetup.js#L69))\r\n2. Notify the user about the plugin, install the plugin, and then add to `tsconfig.json`.\r\n3. Ask the user what they would like to do, then proceed as in option 2.\r\n\r\nOption 3 seems ideal. However, there isn't a permanent opt-out here as we don't have a way to store user preferences:\r\n- We could add a `react-scripts` field to `package.json` to manage user settings for CRA, but that's a big change. However, this may be useful in other cases too.\r\n- We could just run it every time (until the user installs), but that's very annoying.\r\n\r\nIn ideas would be very welcome. This is just a dev dependency, so I would install it regardless of whether the user will use it or not. This is how CSS Module support works for CRA too. After that, all you need is to conditionally load the plugin as I demonstrated in my original comment. @jedmao Here's a rough example:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/compare/master...mrmckeb:feature/typescript-css-modules\r\n\r\nI can finish it very quickly from here, but want to get your thoughts on the direction. The most notable issue is that we need to reference the module as `['.node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/typescript-plugin-css-modules']` - because we can't be sure that it's available at root.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to add it [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/create-react-app/createReactApp.js#L382), so we can just add to `tsconfig.json` as `['typescript-plugin-css-modules']`. @mrmckeb I'm not sure it has to be available at root, so long as it's listed in `react-scripts/package.json` and then in webpack.config.js. See how [the `style-loader` is imported here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/fb465a39e576bde26aab5e91824a1fde78daeb10/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L81).\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I can't help more than that. I'm not that intimately familiar w/ this project. A PR for this is now complete. It might needs some docs. Let me know what you think! @jedmao @mrmckeb Sorry for not responding to your issues ([#1](https://github.com/timothykang/css-module-types/issues/1) [#2](https://github.com/timothykang/css-module-types/issues/2)) sooner over at [css-modules-types](https://github.com/timothykang/css-module-types)...it looks like GitHub doesn't notify about new issues (or at least I don't know how to turn that on).\r\n\r\nThe main reason I stopped development on the plugin was that the dynamic type definitions are only available when editing, and not when compiling. I see that @mrmckeb has since created a fork and [discovered this for himself](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16607#issuecomment-441023845). I would gladly pick up development on this idea again if/when that changes. Until then, good luck and feel free to ping me if there's anything I can do to help. Thanks @timothykang, I've added a few features on top of what you had done - great work by the way. It's a blessing and a curse that plugins are IDE only for now... I think that'll change in future. @mrmckeb @timothykang I've been searching all day for something similar to this. The best things I can find at the moment are these three projects and the latter two depend on the former:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/Quramy/typed-css-modules\r\n* https://github.com/longlho/ts-transform-css-modules\r\n* https://github.com/Jimdo/typings-for-css-modules-loader\r\n\r\nThe first two options seem to be the ones with the fewest drawbacks while the loader one has the unfortunate design flaw of a race condition between creation of the `*.scss.d.ts` files and `tsc` requiring them for compilation.\r\n\r\nWhile none of these options are a panacea by themselves, combining one of them with some other processes I think we can get what we are all after, stronger types at compile time from CSS to TS. \r\n\r\nFor example, suppose if Grunt/Gulp were to watch `*.(css|scss|sass|less)` files for any changes, I believe one could simply run `typed-css-modules` as an additional step directly after each SCSS/SASS/LESS compile to output the generated `*.scss.d.ts` files. This would execute similarly to how a linter runs, it would just be ordered after a compile. Then Webpack/TSC/etc could be configured to watch for those additional `*scss.d.ts` files and type check any `*.ts` files accordingly without any special plugins or transformers.\r\n\r\nI believe having those extra `*.scss.d.ts` files written to the file system would satisfy both the IDE and compilation type enforcement requirements.\r\n\r\nHowever, one downside to every one of these CSS to JS module libraries I have come across is that none of them seem to handle traditional CSS nesting. The only way I've seen one handle nesting is with BEM naming convention which you would rarely if ever use with SCSS/SASS/LESS. @jleider, not to self promote, but did you try https://github.com/mrmckeb/typescript-plugin-css-modules? The downside is that it's IDE only, but the good thing is that it doesn't require additional files in your directories, supports nesting, etc. My team are using it with CRA 2.1+.\r\n\r\nWe (at CRA) could also move to a different TypeScript compiler in future (not using `babel-typescript`) which would allow us to use plugins as transforms (an unofficial feature) - but as it's not official, I'm not sure if that's ideal. It's unfortunate that as of right now, this is not supported by TypeScript officially... I'd encourage you to post over there to show interest in this feature being added to TypeScript. @mrmckeb I did take a look at your plugin, unfortunately an IDE only solution wont work for my team since not everyone uses an IDE during development so we really need a compile time solution. I think I am going to try the solution I proposed in my last https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5677#issuecomment-446754436.  Of course @jleider, as I said it's unfortunate that there isn't another solution right now. This may also be added to the Babel plugin in future... we'll keep thinking of a better way to handle this. Hi guys, I wrote a webpack plugin for my personal use, which also watches files, which are not watched by webpack and runs its own compilation with the same webpack config, which is great for developer experience.\r\n\r\nYou can check it out here:\r\nhttps://github.com/pristas-peter/react-webpack-utils/tree/master/packages/watcher-webpack-plugin\r\nhttps://github.com/pristas-peter/react-webpack-utils/tree/master/packages/css-modules-typings-loader\r\n\r\nPackages are also available at npm:\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/watcher-webpack-plugin\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/css-modules-typings-loader\r\n\r\nIf you find these useful, feel free to add PR if you need more functionality.\r\n\r\n  This looks solid/mature enough (also baked by \"huge\" company): https://github.com/dropbox/typed-css-modules-webpack-plugin @Hotell and @pristas-peter, thanks for sharing these. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned, at this stage we won't be adding a solution that writes additional files to disk. There are IDE-only solutions, like [`typescript-plugin-css-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-plugin-css-modules) that work great with Create React App, but are editor-only for now.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft would need to allow TypeScript plugins/transforms to work outside of the IDE for us to be able to do this cleanly.\r\n\r\nWe definitely have this on our radar and will continue to monitor and assess as we plan the future of CRA. I put down quick gist for anyone reading this issue, if they desperately need this feature without ejecting :)\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/Hotell/01035a3ec202245d6b97937444140877\r\n\r\nI can send PR to update docs if you're willing to accept this :) \r\n\r\nthanks! As a PSA for folks like me who hadn't realized this but are potentially interested - Webstorm has had intelligent support for Typescript importing CSS Modules (and sass modules) built-in since Jun 2017:\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2017/06/webstorm-2017-2-eap-172-2953/\r\n\r\nOne of many reasons I switched over from VSCode a while ago! @zxti, I'd rather this type of thing be an extension than built in. Best to keep vscode lean. That's one thing I love about it. @jedmao I actually highly agree with preferring modular extensibility.  FWIW (and not to turn this thread too off-topic - only mentioned it initially because I thought others might be interested) this Typescript support *is* an extension to the Jetbrains IDE core (that's how I installed it - I don't actually use Webstorm-the-product, but just IntelliJ with these plugins installed).  It's also nice to have features like renaming CSS classes, find-usages, etc. all work seamlessly (which I think these alternative solutions still have a ways to go on). I've made a package that compiles SASS, w/ interpolations, includes, etc, and provides type definitions. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babakness/sass-module-types/master/.github/images/animation.gif\" alt=\"sass-module-types animation\" />\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/babakness/sass-module-types\r\n\r\nIf one does not like the `d.ts` definition files, they can be hidden in VS Code, WebStorm, etc. In VS Code at the moment (Feb 2019) your definitions don't refresh if the file isn't open in the editor, so if you do hide the file you made need to \"peek definition\" to get the update to kick in. Worthy issue to bring up to the VS Code team. Hi @babakness, thanks again for this. \r\n\r\nAgain, it's not something we'll add to CRA, but definitely worth checking out for those looking for a solution.  \r\nI am on React-Scripts 2.0.5. I am eager to use the new Workbox functionality that is mentioned in the release notes for 2.0. I can't find any directions on how to do it though. \r\n\r\nThere are posts on Medium, Freecodecamp and such that are really just hacks to the 1.x versions of React-scripts. \r\n\r\nI had thought since it has just been added as a dependency we could get some assistance on how and where to add configurations. When I include Workbox in my `registerServiceWorker.js` and attempt to set some strategies on assets it crashes the entire app once built. \r\n\r\n`Unable to import module 'workbox-routing' from 'WORKBOX_CDN_ROOT_URL/workbox-routing.prod.js'.`\r\n\r\nI understand serviceworkers are now opt-in.\r\nI understand that in the latest version of create react app the service worker register file is now just called `serviceworker.js`.\r\n\r\n I compared the old `registerServiceWorker.js` to the new  `serviceworker.js` and they are the same. I also am able to build with the default service worker file and I do see Workbox in the application tab in Chrome dev tools. I know its working out of the box. I just want to be able to edit it. Guidance would be greatly appreciated. Im stuck in the same boat.. After struggeling with how the magic works i finally figured out what needs to be done to be able to \"customize\" the service worker routes:\r\n\r\nFirst run `npm run eject`\r\nThan go into /config/webpack.config.prod.js\r\nReplace\r\n`new WorkboxWebpackPlugin.GenerateSW({\r\n      clientsClaim: true,\r\n      exclude: [/\\.map$/, /asset-manifest\\.json$/],\r\n      importWorkboxFrom: 'cdn',\r\n      navigateFallback: publicUrl + '/index.html',\r\n      navigateFallbackBlacklist: [\r\n        // Exclude URLs starting with /_, as they're likely an API call\r\n        new RegExp('^/_'),\r\n        // Exclude URLs containing a dot, as they're likely a resource in\r\n        // public/ and not a SPA route\r\n        new RegExp('/[^/]+\\\\.[^/]+$'),\r\n      ],\r\n    }),`\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n`new WorkboxWebpackPlugin.InjectManifest({\r\n      swSrc: './public/service-worker.js',\r\n    }),`\r\n\r\nwhere as swSrc point to your custom service-worker.\r\n\r\nMy Service-Worker.js looks like this:\r\nif (workbox) {\r\n  console.log(`Yay! Workbox is loaded \ud83c\udf89`);\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log(`Boo! Workbox didn't load \ud83d\ude2c`);\r\n}\r\nworkbox.clientsClaim();\r\nself.__precacheManifest = [].concat(self.__precacheManifest || []);\r\nworkbox.precaching.suppressWarnings();\r\nworkbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__precacheManifest, {});\r\n\r\n\r\nworkbox.routing.registerRoute(\r\n  'http://localhost:3000',\r\n  workbox.strategies.networkFirst()\r\n)\r\n\r\n workbox.routing.registerNavigationRoute(\"/index.html\", {\r\n   blacklist: [/^\\/_/, /\\/[^\\/]+\\.[^\\/]+$/],\r\n });\r\n\r\n As mentioned, @Rainson12 , there have already been a few articles about ejecting and doing something similar to what you have done. I believe the official way to customize using Workbox w/o ejecting is in the works.  I personally don't want to eject. This issue here documents the progress of this new feature(I believe), https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5369 @Nick-t-go  from what i have seen in the other blog posts they all dont work with the current v2 create react app scripts as they all try to get rid of sw-precache and use workbox instead. Now with v2 you dont have to get rid of sw-precache anymore and because of that, all guides i have seen are obsolete and do not work anymore Here's how I've done it with CRA and **without ejecting**. It uses the workbox build workflow. (cra 2.x)\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** - This involves not using the SW generated by create-react-app but generating your own SW with injectManifest mode using the [Workbox build ](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-build#injectmanifest_mode) workflow. Build commands will be added to react-build script in package.json\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** \r\nKeep an eye on #5369 I think it will allow configuring Workbox using the Webpack workflow using a custom configuration file.\r\n\r\n**Step1** : Make sure you register for a SW in the main index.js file. i.e. change `serviceWorker.unregister();` to `serviceWorker.register();`\r\n\r\n**Step2**: Inside `src/serviceWorker.js` in `window.addEventListener('load', () => {` change the swURL to point to a new file (this is what will be created in the build step)\r\nso, change this - `const swUrl = ``${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/service-worker.js``;`\r\nto `const swUrl = ``${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/sw.js``;`\r\n\r\n**Step3**: Create two files under `src/ - sw-build.js and sw.js`\r\n\r\n**Step4**: In `sw-build.js` add the code as provided by [Google's injectManifest example here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/precache-files/workbox-build#call_wzxhzdk7injectmanifestwzxhzdk8) - \r\n```\r\nconst workboxBuild = require('workbox-build');\r\n// NOTE: This should be run *AFTER* all your assets are built\r\nconst buildSW = () => {\r\n  // This will return a Promise\r\n  return workboxBuild.injectManifest({\r\n    swSrc: 'src/sw.js', // this is your sw template file\r\n    swDest: 'build/sw.js', // this will be created in the build step\r\n    globDirectory: 'build',\r\n    globPatterns: [\r\n      '**\\/*.{js,css,html,png}',\r\n    ]\r\n  }).then(({count, size, warnings}) => {\r\n    // Optionally, log any warnings and details.\r\n    warnings.forEach(console.warn);\r\n    console.log(`${count} files will be precached, totaling ${size} bytes.`);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\nbuildSW();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 5**: Inside your custom service worker template file i.e. `src/sw.js` add the injection point and your cache rules. e.g - in the file src/sw.js -\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ('function' === typeof importScripts) {\r\n  importScripts(\r\n    'https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/3.5.0/workbox-sw.js'\r\n  );\r\n  /* global workbox */\r\n  if (workbox) {\r\n    console.log('Workbox is loaded');\r\n\r\n    /* injection point for manifest files.  */\r\n    workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([]);\r\n\r\n/* custom cache rules*/\r\nworkbox.routing.registerNavigationRoute('/index.html', {\r\n      blacklist: [/^\\/_/, /\\/[^\\/]+\\.[^\\/]+$/],\r\n    });\r\n\r\nworkbox.routing.registerRoute(\r\n      /\\.(?:png|gif|jpg|jpeg)$/,\r\n      workbox.strategies.cacheFirst({\r\n        cacheName: 'images',\r\n        plugins: [\r\n          new workbox.expiration.Plugin({\r\n            maxEntries: 60,\r\n            maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 Days\r\n          }),\r\n        ],\r\n      })\r\n    );\r\n\r\n} else {\r\n    console.log('Workbox could not be loaded. No Offline support');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**step 6**: `npm install workbox-build --save-dev`\r\nI think workbox-build is already included in node_modules, but good idea to make an entry in package.json\r\n\r\n**step 7**: in `package.json` add the workbox build step\r\nso, in package.json, under scripts add a new entry - `\"build-sw\": \"node ./src/sw-build.js\"`\r\nand then change: `\"build\": \"react-scripts build`\r\nto `\"build\": \"react-scripts build && npm run build-sw`\r\n\r\nWhen your run `npm run build` you will see the the file `sw.js` inside your build folder. The CRA generated service-worker.js will continue to be there. You can run a build command to clear it, but it won't be used because we change the swURL in step2.\r\n\r\nAgain, all of this may not be relevant if #5369 provides a way to use the webpack flow by providing a custom configuration file. What if: \r\n1) We made our own custom copy of `webpack.config.prod.js` \r\n     Which is currently hosting the `WorkboxWebpackPlugin` and is setting the config at line 515:  \r\n\r\n> `new WorkboxWebpack.GenerateSW...` . \r\n\r\n2) Then in our build script include a script that replaces the default `webpack.config.prod.js` with our own _custom_  copy of `webpack.config.prod.js`\r\n3) In our custom copy we can configure what we  would like using the[ API set here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin). \r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas on whether or not this will work? Not sure if it will work because, in an un-ejecting CRA, we don't have control over the webpack.cofig. #5369 will address the same problem. I think they will provide a workbox.config that will be read by the CRA's webpack.config to allow customizations ...\r\n\r\nAlso discussed here - #5359  @karannagupta finally circling back to this. going to give your suggestion a whirl. Is it possible for you to edit your post and fix the formatting. If it does work I think others will find is useful but more so if it is actually formatted properly to enhance readability. @karannagupta Hey that worked! Thanks for sharing. Anyone who stumbles upon this looking for a way to edit the config for using Workbox with CRA without ejecting please check out [the comment above](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5673#issuecomment-438654051), looks like the official fix is on the slow burn. another way to get this to work is to use `react-app-rewired`, this override in `config-overrides.js` seems to be working:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst WorkboxWebpackPlugin = require('workbox-webpack-plugin');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function override(config, env) {\r\n  config.plugins = config.plugins.map(plugin => {\r\n    if (plugin.constructor.name === 'GenerateSW') {\r\n      return new WorkboxWebpackPlugin.InjectManifest({\r\n        swSrc: './src/sw.js',\r\n        swDest: 'service-worker.js',\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return plugin;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return config;\r\n};\r\n``` I generated a project with `npx create-react-app my-app-ts --typescript`,\r\nthen I created two files, `sw-build.js` and `sw.js` under `src/`,\r\n\r\nThere is an error:\r\n```\r\nCannot compile namespaces when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided.\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13177997/50055284-e672b280-0187-11e9-8ca0-4fbc6c069b9a.png)\r\n\r\nWhat should I do? I've excluded the SW files in `tsconfig.json` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n  ...\r\n  },\r\n  \"include\": [\r\n    \"src/*\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"exclude\": [\r\n    \"node_modules\",\r\n    \"**/*.spec.ts\",\r\n    \"src/sw-*.js\",\r\n    \"src/idb.js\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n``` @karannagupta - could you make a gist or a repo describing your workaround please? It's getting a bit hard following it. @karannagupta & others: i think #5369 would allow you to pass custom config to the `GenerateSW` plugin but wouldn\u2019t allow you to use the `InjectManifest` plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n Has anyone else tried @karannagupta's method and run into problems debugging locally? When I deploy with the ootb service worker, it is hooked up and running no problem. When I use the example here, and validate that the correct files are ouput into my /build directory (I've run through the directions multiple times at this point), I start running into errors - specifically it looks like CRA may be looking for \"service-worker.js\" when it compiles and deploys. When my service worker is named sw.js, it does not register successfully. If I change the name of my generated sw.js file to service-worker.js, a service worker is registered but it is the \"no-op\" version that CRA inserts when debugging locally.  Hi @bscaspar, what errors do you run into? Or is it after you run debug some file?\r\n\r\nI've attached screenshots of my console with Workbox messages for localhost ( using `serve -s build` ) that uses the custom sw.js for reference.\r\n\r\nI also clear out the default CRA service-worker.js file like this -\r\n```\r\n    \"build-sw\": \"node ./src/sw-build.js\",\r\n    \"clean-cra-sw\": \"rm -f build/precache-manifest.*.js && rm -f build/service-worker.js\",\r\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build && npm run build-sw && npm run clean-cra-sw\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n![workbox_sw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36845810/51594311-290f7380-1f1a-11e9-8601-582f7761f958.png)\r\n\r\n![workbox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36845810/51593888-3841f180-1f19-11e9-82a3-e92dc4e98535.png)\r\n\r\n Thanks for getting back to me @karannagupta turns out I was missing the serve step - previously I was testing by building then running the app with npm run start. Things are running smoothly with serve, thanks again for putting this workaround together! Another addition to this thread (which was very instructive).\r\n(Source and context on [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55062427/1182976))\r\n\r\n# Append your code to generated service-worker\r\nThere's a module for it: [cra-append-sw](https://github.com/bbhlondon/cra-append-sw).\r\nYou're in charge to provide the appended code.\r\n\r\n___Pros___: easy setup, takes advantage of GenerateSW\r\n\r\n___Cons___: appended code is processed with Babel/Webpack, but not using CRA's config (you could opt-out).

I'm just trying to understand this better. Thanks Hi @ripern \r\n\r\nI didn't look into great details of Craco, but in the end, it simply boils down to using Create React App without ejecting and being okay with no control over webpack's config. The difference in my approach is that it uses the Workbox build workflow, but if CRA did allow adding custom config to its webpack config, I would have preferred [Workbox Webapck Plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin) to achieve the same result like craco-workbox and the one suggested by @maciejsimka \r\n\r\nLooks like Craco is similar to react-app-rewired. They are both very cool projects but you have to decide based on your requirements if adding another dependency would make sense. As react-scripts update, you'll have to take care that things don't break ...  `tsconfig.json` or  `jsconfig.json`: \r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"@/*\":[\"src/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nsee https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5118\r\n\r\nThis will help VSCode and other IDE to resolve path in TypeScript & JavaScript.  You may be interested: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5118#issuecomment-434591873 @tanduong if we use yarn-pnp, we  have no `node_modules` dir. All of these solutions don't resolve some reasons to just typescript \"paths\" feature. And without \"baseUrl\" set to something, paths don't work at all. I really think that baseURL (at least set to .) should be something we can opt into. I'm having this issue. I have `NODE_PATH` set , to make it work w/ TS i need to set `paths` to set that I need `baseUrl` and here we are. As a hack/work around, one can set the desired configurations in a different `.json` file then use the `extends` features of `tsconfig.json`. While you do get a warning, it does not override and the settings and proceeds. Using this setting I can test and build without issue (so far)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"svg/*\": [\"src/svg/*\"],\r\n      \"components/*\": [\"src/components/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nin `tsconfig.json` I have\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"./paths.json\"\r\n}\r\n``` One of the side-effects of setting `baseUrl: \".\"`, is that TypeScript now thinks you can import using an absolute path of `\"src/Foo\"`, which may or may not work with the current webpack/jest config. It's unfortunate that we can't use `paths` without also being forced to opt into the absolute path from `baseUrl`. @ianschmitz [tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/dividab/tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin) can works with current webpack config. We can use tslint to show warn of \u300cusing an absolute path of \"src/Foo\"\u300d It just works with react-scripts@2.0.5 and react-app-rewire-typescript-babel-preset@3\r\nI waste half day on this. Now I decide downgrade. We have our own version of `react-scripts` and customise this for our needs.\r\n\r\nOne solution I think could work is to allow it to be set whenever NODE_PATH is set to `src`, for less confusion (note, I don't use the `@`-style).\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"*\": [\"src/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n > As a hack/work around, one can set the desired configurations in a different `.json` file then use the `extends` features of `tsconfig.json`.

Are you importing files outside of `./src`? Just trying to understand the motifivation, because managing all the folder names within `src` is not ideal. I've tried extending tsconfig.json but it's still unable to resolve, I'm using cra@2.1.1 This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n What is the current recommendation for getting absolute paths to work? It would be great if it worked with TypeScript's built in way of doing this. I am trying to use `baseUrl` and `paths` but CRA automatically removes those settings from my `tsconfig.json` completely disabling the use of them which is highly frustrating. @ChristianIvicevic I had the same issue. Once I realized that's not a supported path, I \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  This issue is disappointing, since I want to avoid weird relative paths, especially something like `../../../components/Foo/Bar`. On the other hand I'd really prefer not to eject at all since I don't need a full blown customization of the default configuration. It just bothers me how opinionated CRA is while still being so useful for small pet projects at the very same time. It is frustrating. It doesn't make sense that anyone would have to eject for something so small like this. Some hack ideas I have is to configure the file system to prevent overriding the file by CRA and to try the new TypeScript 3.2 feature where you can `extend` from an NPM package. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What%27s-new-in-TypeScript#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages\r\n\r\nI don't have time to hack it right now but honestly one reason I've not upgraded CRA2 since the `extend` hack above was patched.\r\n\r\nCRA2 should at least allow us to do what we want at \"our own risk\". The more important question is **_why_** is CRA changing this file? What's the underlying problem or concern? I'd love to know, because perhaps someone can come up with a better solution. Reasoning is here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5585#issuecomment-433900655\r\n\r\nI think users should be allowed to change config even if it is not supported at their own risk. > Some hack ideas I have is to configure the file system to prevent overriding the file by CRA and to try the new TypeScript 3.2 feature where you can `extend` from an NPM package.\r\n\r\nI actually attempted this as well as described here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5645#issuecomment-435201019\r\n\r\nUnfortunately CRA had a meltdown and basically ignores the settings. @ChristianIvicevic you tried specifically through NPM? So the config lives in node_modules. I believe at the time of the comment. That feature was not released yet.  @babakness I tried extending an external tsconfig (not in node_modules though) and the react-scripts noticed something odd, attempted to remove baseUrl and paths, but failed, messed with the formatting, but luckily left the extended file that only contains baseUrl and paths. Unfortunately the application had an error at this point since paths could not be resolved. Likely an issue due to babel not being able to properly resolve the actual paths. Like most people I've followed this [workaround](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5645#issuecomment-435201019) (thanks for it btw), however with the latest ```react-script``` it keeps modifying and checking out my ```tsconfig.json```, which is quite frustrating. All I wanted to do is setup the ```baseUrl``` and ```paths``` property so that it aligns with my ```NODE_PATH=src/``` settings in order to get intellisense and typescript compiler support with imports. Not doing any breaking changes!\r\n\r\nAnyway, [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5625#issuecomment-441162818) led me to an alternative solution, using the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Install [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) and add the ```postinstall``` script. Instructions available on the patch-package repo.\r\n2. Modify ```verifyTypeScriptSetup.js``` from ```node_modules\\react-scripts\\scripts\\utils``` by removing [this section](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/49e258b4a6d04fb7e3542d7a060c6dcad4093564/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/verifyTypeScriptSetup.js#L126-L130).\r\n3. Run ```npx patch-package react-scripts```. This will creates a ```patches``` folder with a ```.patch``` file corresponding to the change made inside ```verifyTypeScriptSetup.js```.\r\n4. Make sure to commit the patch file created.\r\n\r\n```patch-package``` will apply the patch whenever you run ```npm install``` or ```npm ci```. \r\n\r\n**Few things to keep in mind with this workaround:**\r\n\r\n1. If ```react-scripts``` changes the way it enforces the ```baseUrl``` restriction, you'll need to carry out the above steps to patch whatever new method is used.\r\n2. If ```react-scripts``` starts supporting ```baseUrl```, remove this workaround and the patch and just start using ```react-scripts``` as normal.\r\n\r\nNo an ideal situation to be in, but it'll do for the time being until better support is provided. Also it means I don't have to fork the repo.\r\n\r\nHope it helps. @IIFE curious, what instead of `extends` from a local file, we extend from `node_modules` using TypeScript 3.2 new feature\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What%27s-new-in-TypeScript#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages\r\n\r\nHave you tried this? > @IIFE curious, what instead of `extends` from a local file, we extend from `node_modules` using TypeScript 3.2 new feature\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What%27s-new-in-TypeScript#tsconfigjson-inheritance-via-nodejs-packages\r\n> \r\n> Have you tried this?\r\n\r\nI haven't tried extending from node_modules. I might give it a try in a test project. However, I don't think the behaviour will be any different. My understanding is that ```node_modules``` inheritance is just simply allowing a package path to be specified for ```extends```, the outcome is probably just the same as extending from a local path. I thought `tsconfig.json` is TS-specific which is why I initially didn't want to support this particular way of configuring it, and preferred alternatives (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5692 and https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5118). But it seems like VS Code also respects `jconfig.json` which also supports a `paths` option.\r\n\r\nMy proposal: **Let\u2019s read `paths` configuration from `jsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.json`, and use it everywhere (including for Webpack and Jest).** This could also supersede the `NODE_PATH` solution for JS users.\r\n\r\nAny objections to this? @gaearon Like that idea! I just created a PR to kickstart `NODE_PATH` support in TS: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6116 but happy to change that to support a `tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json` convention. That immediately solves one of the issues I encountered with letting vscode understand the `NODE_PATH` magic happening behind the scenes. Thanks for jumping on this! \r\n\r\nI'd be happy to deemphasize `NODE_PATH` support if `jsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.json` solve this better. Does its configuration cover all use cases for `NODE_PATH`? Can someone explain to me what `baseUrl` is for? All examples I can find are using `'.'`. I think if these Use cases are supported, it will be fine:\r\n- Using baseUrl without using paths \r\n`{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\r\n}`\r\n- Using baseUrl with paths\r\n`\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"@/*\":[\"src/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}`\r\n As far as I understand `react-scripts` it only uses `NODE_PATH` to match Node's resolving mechanism in Webpack. So we should be able to just replace that with a path from `jsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.json`. But would be good to have @Timer's confirmation if I don't overlook any other use cases for `NODE_PATH`. Do we know that every valid `baseUrl` / `paths` combination is \"translateable\" into Webpack/Jest terms without losing information? Well, in theory you could set `baseUrl` to `.` and your editor would not warn you if you import something like `src/components/button` while from the point of CRA we don't want people to set up an absolute path outside of the `src` directory. \r\n\r\nI think the best way to prevent people from doing this is to fail the build and throw a warning saying we do not allow `baseUrl`/`paths` outside of the `src` directory. We could also support it but without passing these files through Babel. Won't that confuse people that their files don't get transpiled? I have already seen a few issues of people trying to put JS files outside of the `src` directory for various reasons. We auto-generate the config, so a quick solution would be to force `tsconfig.json` to match `NODE_PATH` if it's set. This is a quick win that will please many, but not all users. > We auto-generate the config, so a quick solution would be to force `tsconfig.json` to match `NODE_PATH` if it's set. This is a quick win that will please many, but not all users.\r\n\r\nI understand NODE_PATH supports multiple values with a delimiter. src,whatever,.. and I think jsconfig / tsconfig baseUrl can only be one.\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/c8c3e48abd4bb93febf2c94b1b5fdb4f8738540e/packages/react-scripts/config/env.js#L62\r\n\r\nI think, baseUrl only will make sense with value 'src', since the appSrc is always 'src'\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/c8c3e48abd4bb93febf2c94b1b5fdb4f8738540e/packages/react-scripts/config/paths.js#L107\r\n\r\n I think it's reasonable to only allow `src` as `baseUrl` in the first implementation and see if other needs arise. Would that still allow aliasing `src` to `@`? @gaearon it would. I have updated my PR (#6116) with a way to read the baseUrl from these config files but only allow `src` as a value.\r\n\r\nDoesn't seem so difficult to add support for the `@` alias as well. However how much control do we want to give the user? As the `paths` are quite flexible on their own. Do we want to restrict it to only `@` to `src` at this stage? I don't think we need to support the `@` alias in this effort, as it's more of a convention than a feature. \r\n\r\nAlso, @JulianIsrael, `baseUrl` is a single value, but `paths` supports multiple. My opinion is that we should try to map this to `NODE_PATH` for consistency. Well, the `NODE_PATH` convention never really took off. As far as I know, there's no editor supporting it and many tools don't respect it either. Given the huge amount of people in the JS community using `vscode` I think it's a good choice to go with this `jsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.json` convention. If CRA would support that I think that would tremendously help with setting a good convention within the community.\r\n\r\nI'm totally in favor of supporting only the `baseUrl` option, but I know a lot of people rather have some sort of prefix to make a distinction between their own code and vendor code. So I'll leave it to @gaearon for which direction we want to take here. Happy to implement it either way! Agreed @rovansteen, if `NODE_PATH` is we could avoid `NODE_PATH` altogether, that would be ideal - what I want to avoid is a world where we have both in place. @rovansteen We tend to use `~/` as the prefix but it's trivial for us to change it to `@` or something too. In terms of a big deal vs. little deal, it's not a big deal to not have a prefix but like you said, it denotes _our_ code vs. vendor code.\r\n\r\n@gaearon You had asked what `baseUrl` is used for in TS. Can try to help there.\r\n\r\nThe official description is:\r\n\r\n> Base directory to resolve **non-relative module names**. See Module Resolution documentation for more details.\r\n\r\nFrom that other reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#base-url\r\n\r\n> Setting baseUrl informs the compiler where to find modules. All module imports with non-relative names are assumed to be relative to the baseUrl.\r\n>\r\n> Value of baseUrl is determined as either:\r\n>\r\n> - value of baseUrl command line argument (if given path is relative, it is computed based on current directory)\r\n> - value of baseUrl property in \u2018tsconfig.json\u2019 (if given path is relative, it is computed based on the location of \u2018tsconfig.json\u2019)\r\n> Note that relative module imports are not impacted by setting the baseUrl, as they are always resolved relative to their importing files.\r\n>\r\n> You can find more documentation on baseUrl in RequireJS and SystemJS documentation.\r\n\r\nThe phrase **all non-relative imports** is important. Setting `baseUrl` to `./src` actually will have TS search for regular `node_modules` packages relative to that path.\r\n\r\nMeaning this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWon't work because it's searching from `./src/*`. That's why you see `.` used everywhere, as it's relative to the `tsconfig.json` which is typically next to `node_modules`.\r\n\r\n> *Note:* I'm saying it doesn't work but the case I'm using, I'm doing `import { ExecutionResult } from \"graphql\"` and I have a `src/graphql.ts` file, and it uses that instead of the node module, seen here:\r\n>\r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/563819/50924250-a617f480-1414-11e9-90b5-fb3948805194.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can get the above to work by doing:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n   \"baseUrl\": \"./src\",\r\n   \"paths\": {\r\n     react: [\"../node_modules/react\"]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that's probably not what you'd like.\r\n\r\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong but I think that helps explain its purpose.\r\n\r\nAlso, FWIW, I'd love zero restrictions on what we can add to `paths` since you can do nice aliasing with it. You could force `@/` or `~/` or whatever in there by default, but if we add our own paths, I wouldn't want them overwritten/blown away. @kamranayub TypeScript will mimic node resolution by moving upwards in the directory tree and look for `node_modules` folder if it can't find the module. So if you set your `baseUrl` to `src` it will still look for React in `../node_modules/react` after it wasn't able to find it in `src`. @rovansteen if it wasn't able to find it; but in my example above, I have a file (module) `graphql.ts` and it chose that, instead of the npm package `graphql` like it was doing properly before (using `baseUrl: \".\"`). @kamranayub if you have the @types/graphql installed, that shouldn't be happening. Apparently it would prefer ts modules first than js on its resolution. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4955274/50962660-1cfacf00-14a1-11e9-8128-314910fc9162.png)\r\n  Using the `\"extends\": \"./tsconfig.extend.json\"` and the `\"baseUrl\": \"./src\"` solves the compilation issue (currently on `\"react-scripts\": \"2.1.3\"`).\r\n\r\nHowever the build fails with `Cannot find module 'xyz' from ...` during the test phase. I had a similar issue  on a setup with Webpack, it was solved by updating the `moduleNameMapper` on the `jest.config.js`.\r\n\r\n@mrmckeb, @gaearon What is the current status / is it possible to help? @marc-ed-raffalli this is officially not supported yet. See #6116 for the progress for official support for this in TypeScript. As far as I can tell only actual import alias are discussed here as a use case i.e. telling cra to emit an import alias via tsconfig.json `paths`. \r\n\r\nHowever this is not the primary concern of `paths`. This option does not change how `tsc` emits import paths. This is purely for the typechecker to know where to look for types. E.g. I'm using `react-redux@3` and `@types/react-redux`. To tell the type checker what types I'm using I would have to add the following to my tsconfig: \r\n```\r\n\"paths\": {\r\n   \"react-redux\": [ \"react-redux/v3\" ]\r\n},\r\n```\r\nThis would break at runtime if `create-react-app` would actually change the import paths in the emitted code.\r\n\r\nSource: Microsoft/TypeScript#10866  My 2cts after having played with this for a while: \r\n\r\nFor a solution to absolute paths without any customization, you can use the following solution (tested with `react-scripts@2.1.3`, `react-scripts@2.1.8`).\r\n\r\n1. Add a `.env` file:\r\n```\r\nNODE_PATH=./\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a `tsconfig.paths.json` file:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\",\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"src/*\": [\"*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add  the following line at the end of the generated `tsconfig.json`.\r\n```\r\n\"extends\": \"./tsconfig.paths.json\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth compilation and intellisense should now work with absolute import support using the `src/` prefix \ud83c\udf89 (eg. `import Counter from 'src/components/Counter';`)\r\n\r\nYou can even reuse the exact same setup (without even needing the extends hack) for non-typescript projects with a `jsconfig.json` file.\r\n\r\nI quite like the `src/` prefix convention which is perfectly explicit (Principle of Least Surprise) vs a more cryptic `@/` or `~/`, tilde is also commonly aliased to`node_modules/` in the scss world so I think it should be avoided.\r\n\r\nAnd the bonus point for `src/` is that it easily works outside the box thanks to the `NODE_PATH` env var without any extra webpack tweaks. Also works with jest tests (but if you want to store them inside the root `test` directory, you'll have to add `\"test\"` to the `\"include\"` array in the `tsconfig.json` (won't be overwritten).\r\n\r\nFinally if you start working on mono-repos of CRA's (I've been doing that lately to leverage a shared storybook-based components \"library\" across multiple apps), you'll encounter errors when cross referencing files that all uses the same absolute convention, I've built a [babel plugin](https://github.com/mgcrea/babel-plugin-module-name-mapper) to address that, might be useful. @mgcrea your solution does work!\r\n\r\nThe only limitation I found is that vscode does not know how to resolve missing imports this way. It won't build the the right path.\r\n\r\nUsing only:\r\n``` JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nseems sufficient to use `src/`. I then limit import outside of `src` using TS Lint. @mgcrea Thank you for the solution! \r\nMy only gripe with it, is that CRA still says that the baseUrl and paths should not be set (and tries to unset them in vain) \r\nHave you found a solution for it? or do you simply ignore the error?  I've just tried the above solution with `react-scripts@2.1.8` and it didn't work.\r\nThe intellisense doesn't complain but if I try to open the project in browser it fails to resolve my module :slightly_frowning_face:  @dorshinar I just simply ignore the error, it will probably go away when it becomes officially supported.\r\n\r\n@mikheevm Just re-tried from scratch my solution with `react-scripts@2.1.8` and encountered no issues.\r\n\r\n@joelbourbon In my case vscode does properly resolve missing imports too:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"591\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-03-12 at 10 34 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108273/54189598-6d4ad900-44b2-11e9-82cf-ead20a43ecc7.png\">\r\n @mgcrea Looks like this approach doesn't work well with the new TS speed improvement (react-scripts 2.1.8). It doesn't type-check dependent modules.\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n```\r\n// src/index.tsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport Test from 'src/shared/Test';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <Test a={123} />,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n);\r\n\r\n// src/shared/Test.tsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\ntype Props = {\r\n  a: number;\r\n}\r\nconst Test = (props: Props) => <div>a={props.a}</div>;\r\nexport default Test;\r\n```\r\nSo far so good, it all compiles, and the module path `src/shared/Test` resolves well.\r\n\r\nNow the funny part. I do some refactoring for the Test component - rename the prop `a` to `b`.\r\nRecompilation happens, but no error is emitted from TS type check - apparently the type checking for `src/index.tsx` file never ran.\r\nI need to modify the file `src/index.tsx` in any way (e.g. add an extra empty line somewhere) in order to trigger type checking for this file - only then the type error (\"Property 'a' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & Props'\") is emitted.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a blocker for me. In the meantime I have to downgrading to react-scripts 2.1.3 - in order to be able to use absolute import paths (configured via tsconfig.paths.json).\r\n\r\nDo you have any workaround for that @mgcrea? @mikheevm\r\n> I've just tried the above solution with `react-scripts@2.1.8` and it didn't work.\r\n> The intellisense doesn't complain but if I try to open the project in browser it fails to resolve my module \ud83d\ude41\r\n\r\nI had that issue. In my case it was caused by a very weird factor: I had a custom NODE_PATH environment variable defined in my bash profile. Somehow it didn't play well with the setup, and even overriding it in .env file wouldn't work. > My 2cts after having played with this for a while:\r\n> \r\n> For a solution to absolute paths without any customization, you can use the following solution (tested with `react-scripts@2.1.3`, `react-scripts@2.1.8`).\r\n> \r\n> 1.

Out of interest why do some authors choose to use `@` as a prefix for aliased imports - I thought that might be confused with using scoped packages from node_modules? I don't understand either. It makes much more sense to use \"src/...\" as that's the actual name of the folder @delaaxe, I actually agree with you entirely. That type of aliasing doesn't make sense to me, as no clearer than not aliasing with an `@` now that we have scoped modules. > @mikheevm\r\n> \r\n> > I've just tried the above solution with `react-scripts@2.1.8` and it didn't work.\r\n> > The intellisense doesn't complain but if I try to open the project in browser it fails to resolve my module \ud83d\ude41\r\n> \r\n> I had that issue.

Haven't found a simple workaround for now, but didn't really have time to dig in. I guess we might have to wait for aliases support (but could be a long time). For now I'm staying on the 2.x branch. Will try to revisit later. @mytee306 That trick still works for me on 3.0.1 without rewired. I had to set NODE_PATH in package.json so it doesn't get overridden by system variables @delaaxe I've create a [branch](https://github.com/mytee306/cra-ts-paths/tree/without-react-app-rewired) which does not use `react-app-rewired` and I've even set the `env` variable inline, however the compiler still attempts to resolve the package in `<project root>/src` @mytee306 Got it working by changing\r\nTS options to :\r\n```\r\n\"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n\"paths\": {\r\n  \"src/*\": [\"src/*\"],\r\n  \"lib/*\": [\"lib/*\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow in index.tsx I can use real absolute paths :\r\n`import Foo from \"src/path/to/Foo\";`\r\n\r\nSame thing for lib Has anyone gotten this to work without TS? I saw the deprecation warning about no longer supporting `NODE_PATH` in `.env`, so I've tried adding a bunch of the above suggestions to a `jsconfig.json` file, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \"src\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(along with different \"paths\" like `\"src/*\": [\"*\"]`), but I can't seem to get it to work (on `react-scripts` 3.0.1). Still getting `./src/index.js Module not found: Can't resolve 'src/containers/App'`. @delaaxe Typescript recognizes the type signature and VSCode references also work out of the box. The issue pops up when you run the start script.  ## Bug report\r\n\r\nI created a new project with the `--typescript` flag, and added a type for my component's props like so:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\ntype AppProps = {\r\n  name: string\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component<AppProps> {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      ...\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn index.tsx when I write something like (note the missing prop):\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')); // name prop is missing\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get an error in both my editor (VSCode) and on my console when I run `yarn start`.\r\n\r\nHowever in my tests if I have something like:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nit('renders without crashing', () => {\r\n  const div = document.createElement('div');\r\n  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);\r\n  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the type error in my editor but **NOT** when I run `yarn test`, the tests run successfully in fact.\r\n\r\nIs this intended?\r\n Check out your `tsconfig.json`.\r\n\r\nChange this to an empty array if you want to include them\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"exclude\": [\r\n    \"**/__tests__/**\",\r\n    \"**/?*test.*\",\r\n    \"**/?*spec.*\"\r\n  ]\r\n``` the types are checked in the `build` script This is currently a known limitation. We can check these types in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, please rely on VSCode to type check your tests or run `tsc`. Another option, update your test scripts to run `tsc`.\r\n\r\nUpdate your `package.json` file:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- \"test\": \"react-scripts test\",\r\n+ \"test\": \"tsc && react-scripts test\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `tsc` command will look for [compiler options in the `tsconfig.json` file](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) if one exists.\r\n\r\n## Additional Optional Solutions\r\n\r\nIf you have a different testing script for `CI` then add `tsc` to that one too:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n\"test:ci\": \"CI=true tsc && react-scripts test --env=jsdom --coverage\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using `husky`, add `tsc` to your `pre-commit` hook:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"husky\": {\r\n    \"hooks\": {\r\n      \"pre-commit\": \"tsc && lint-staged\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n``` We can also use [`ts-jest`](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) which does the actual typechecking in jest.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks\r\n\r\nThis plugin enforce [rule of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) to avoid common misstakes (hook in condition, ...). \r\n\r\n[Hooks](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68) are a new React feature. Yeah, we should probably cut 3.x alpha with this. I'd love to contribute here, if I could.\r\n\r\nShould I just go ahead and make a PR? Sure.\r\n\r\nThere are two action items here:\r\n\r\n* Add ESLint plug-in (probably behind an option in the preset, but enabled in CRA by default)\r\n* Add Babel plug-in that would force array destructuring to work in loose mode for known Hooks. This is important for performance. \r\n @eivind88 Any progress on this? I got it working locally with minor changes in packages `eslint-config-react-app` and `babel-preset-react-app`, although I may well have missed something important.... Also not entirely sure what @gaearon means by \r\n\r\n> probably behind an option in the preset\r\n\r\nfor eslint-plugin-react-hooks. This is my first foray into create-react-app so please excuse me if I've missed something obvious, including any handling required for ejected projects.\r\n\r\nI could always push up a branch if you want to see a diff. @chriswilty I'm about at the same place that you describe, but I haven't found the time to finsh it up this last week; I've also got the changes working locally.\r\n\r\n> probably behind an option in the preset\r\n\r\nmeans that it should be optional, via an arg or somesuch.\r\nThis basically involves rewriting the relevant script by wrapping it in some checks similar to what can be seen in the other sub-repos, if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nI think I should be able to push some changes within a weeks time. Just pushed my changes; I think I've covered everything, except the \"behind an option in the preset, but enabled in CRA by default\"-part about the ESLint plugin.\r\n\r\nI'd love some input on the best way of achieving this! \ud83d\udc4d This is where I'd ended up also :) Is it going to be available in a version prior to `3.0` ?\r\n\r\nWe really need this one guys \ud83d\ude0d What are we waiting for? I believe we're waiting on #5602 and #6219 before we consider hooks ready for prime time in create-react-app. @gaearon can you confirm? \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\nI'm getting weird errors in my CRA+TS app like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by MyComponent. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed. For more information, read the Rules of Hooks: https://fb.me/rules-of-hooks\r\n\r\n   Previous render    Next render\r\n   -------------------------------\r\n1. useContext         useContext\r\n2. useState           useState\r\n3. useCallback        useEffect\r\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which I'm hoping this new ESLint plugin will help me to debug!  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nThe current stance of CRA to disallow importing files from outside the root folder of an app forces the most involved users, those with multiple projects, to jump through hoops that should be unnecessary in order to share code, both components and utils.\r\n\r\nCurrent options are \r\n- Symlink folders.  This apparently is flakey (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3547) and can potentially cause issues running on Windows\r\n- Copy the source files into multiple locations every time they are modified, and check in many copies of hundreds of files.  This is our current approach at my company as it works well in CI, but results in human error when newbs edit the copied file rather than the original, and is messy with hundreds of unnecessary copies existing in the codebase.\r\n\r\nIf we can allow CRA project to just act as another non-special folder in a larger mono-repo, and import files from outside it's root folder, it would greatly improve the experience of working with many CRA projects while keeping all the benefits of not ejecting.\r\n\r\n My best experience is w/ using yarn workspaces. It was made intentionally to prevent users from importing something wrong.\r\nYou can either use workspaces or eject and remove `ModuleScopePlugin` from the `resolve.plugins` option in both dev/prod configuration. I personally am having one hell of a time getting CRA to work with yarn workspaces.\r\n\r\nWith the following setup:\r\n```js\r\npackages/graphql - all my graphql fragments, queries, mutations, subscriptions\r\npackages/controllers - shared JSX code between web/native\r\npackages/web - cra 2.0\r\npackages/native - react native\r\n```\r\n\r\nCRA says, oh you want to do graphql just use `babel-plugin-macros` with `graphql.macro` except that library only supports relative path imports, not an import like `@monorepo/graphql/queries/user.graphql`\r\n\r\nCRA also doesn't support monorepo so I have to setup webpack, parcel, or something similar to bundle my JSX, but also to run the babel macros and have it all compiled so react can import it. It just seems to defeat the purpose of CRA, I want my imported code to run under the same config options that CRA has and not have to duplicate it all and have a separate bundler running in `packages/controllers`.\r\n\r\nIf I don't use a monorepo to share my code, then I am publishing a private npm package every time I make a change. @miraage I know it was intentional, and there were reasons.  I'd like to see those reasons revisited given the inordinate amount of hacks it requires to work with multiple projects, which I presume was not fully appreciated at the time the decision was made.\r\n\r\nA config option to let projects opt out of this feature would be sufficient, where the majority of people still get the same behavior but power users do not have arbitrary barriers to good hygiene put in their way > If I don't use a monorepo to share my code, then I am publishing a private npm package every time I make a change.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to publish the package. In your package.json just specify the local path to module > You don't have to publish the package. In your package.json just specify the local path to module\r\n\r\nso I currently have a `package.json` everywhere, but because these are located outside the `cra` folder root, they aren't compiled, so I am currently running `babel src --watch --out-dir dist` in my other packages and using `graphql-tag.macro` to compile graphql @eddiemonge a few points about multiple repos:\r\n1 - A small portion of our overall code base should not dictate how we choose to store and share code. We use monorepos for very good reasons, and CRA gets in the way of that.  If it forces us to choose between our monorepo and ejecting, we'll eject, but we really don't want to.\r\n2 - Using multiple repos just for CRA apps makes it work differently to every other piece of code we use.  It works differently in CI, each new engineer needs to know it's a special case etc.  None of this is necessary.\r\n3 - This current limitation is a design choice.  It can be removed at any time with minimal to no issues being caused.  This decision should be discussed at length by the React team based on feedback from the community.  Discussing the various workarounds is not overly helpful - they're all hacks around a limitation that can be removed, thereby removing the need for bad code organization This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n OK, here's some recent activity.  This feature still makes sense and prevents clean usage of more than one CRA project per code repo.  Any movement on this? This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

Any movement on this? Any improvements or suggestions in here? @shaneosullivan \r\n\r\nThis worked for me. Given this structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u25bd monorepo-folder\r\n  \u25bd common-folder\r\n    thing.js\r\n  \u25bd create-react-app-folder\r\n    .env\r\n  \u25b7 other-folder\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd this entry to the `create-react-app-folder/.env` file\r\n\r\n`NODE_PATH='./../'`\r\n\r\nNow you can import common stuff in the `cra` code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport Thing from 'common/thing';\r\nimport OtherThing from 'other-folder';\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's still a *bit* of a work-around, but it's the cleanest solution I've managed so far. \r\n @humancatfood amazing, that works!! Thanks so much! What about just using npm link?  I have an external library that i'd like to actively develop inside the consuming CRA, but I have to restart the app every time to see the changes.  Angular CLI has had a flag when running in dev mode for a while... `--follow-symlinks`  @humancatfood, @shaneosullivan \r\n\r\nHow can you convert these outside components to ES5? @ianqueue I'm sure you can get something more scalable working with npm links, but I never managed to get my head around those and the `NODE_PATH` solution is good enough for my purposes.\r\n\r\n@sezeregrek I don't know.. same as everything else? Hi again @ianqueue & @shaneosullivan,\r\n\r\nso I *did* get my head around this in the meantime (or at least I _think_ I did..)\r\n\r\nYou don't need to `npm link` anything at all (nor do you have to feck around with any environment variables): in your `cra` folder, simply do \r\n\r\n`npm install <path/to/your/external/module>`\r\n\r\nThis should create an entry in `package.json` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"your-external-packages-name\": \"file:<path/to/your/external/module>\",\r\n    // other deps\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now import it in your cra code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport bla from 'your-external-packages-name';\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you make changes to your external package it should propagate to the cra app and without you having to reload.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  Does the method described by @humancatfood require that code in the `common` and `other` folders be pre-compiled or will CRA compile them with webpack? Nope, it'll all get compiled together by the CRA.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggested simply lets you import stuff from another location than before, it doesn't change anything about what happens to that stuff after that, ie compiling, babel-ing, etc. @humancatfood could you provide dummy repository example of your setup ? `yarn add path/to/ui-lib` for example, where `lib` is a shared components library and then `import Component from 'ui-lib'` sure gives me compiler errors @bjerkins  \r\n\r\nIt's not like I don't have an actual job that needs doing, but ok, here you go: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/humancatfood/outside-imports\r\n\r\nThe crucial step is in this commit: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/humancatfood/outside-imports/commit/a956f08fdac1b1f86dbc2be0459e333825cac0df\r\n\r\nAnd here it is deployed: \r\n\r\nhttps://humancatfood.github.io/outside-imports/\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter playing around with this for a bit longer, I think using npm link is actually better though @humancatfood right. Thanks for taking the time to show what you meant. \r\n\r\n> Does the method described by @humancatfood require that code in the `common` and `other` folders be pre-compiled or will CRA compile them with webpack?\r\n\r\nIf you're importing e.g shared React components, then yes. @humancatfood 's example doesn't handle that, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n @waynebloss Apologies, I was thinking of minification, etc. \r\n\r\nIf you want to import .jsx, then yes, you need to precompile it. \r\n\r\nOr eject and define your own loaders.\r\n\r\nOr write React in standard js of course: https://github.com/humancatfood/outside-imports/commit/9589f66b53fca9c3688376735aa6e561452a4976   I know there are \"umpteen\" ways to support running CRA inside an electron renderer process but most are very \"hacky\" or require ejecting/forking. This seems to work just fine and seems like a simple addition, and it should support most of the electron use cases. Thoughts?\r\n Thank you for your pull request and welcome to our community.

Someone needs to resolve the branch conflicts. like to have this feature This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Since this just got automatically set to 'stale', I just wanted to chime in that this would help me out quite a bit. Is there any interest by the CRA maintainers in having this functionality? I need to update this PR to reflect the latest CRA but it was a SUPER simple 2 line change to allow the Webpack target to be configured for the electron renderer which is already supported. So it\u2019s completely opt-in and won\u2019t affect anything else. I\u2019m sure there is more that could be done but in my initial use case simply changing the target was enough to make electron play nicely.  I may add that this is needed by a lot of people.

Don't close please > I may add that this is needed by a lot of people.\r\n\r\nadded yet? it seems still no such environment variables in 3.0.1 I'll be revisiting this PR shortly as I'll probably need it for a new implementation later this week. @heyimalex I don\u2019t think we need to prefix with experimental since `electron-renderer` is an official webpack [target](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/).  \r\n\r\nHowever, the [advanced-configuration.md](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/docusaurus/docs/advanced-configuration.md) docs need to reflect the new .env option.  \r\n\r\n@heyimalex what description would you like in the `usage` column to address your concerns?  \r\n\r\nI agree that [scaffolding](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c), [native dependencies](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder), and [debugging](https://github.com/reach/router/issues/25) are the responsibility of the user and generally out of scope for CRA.  \r\n\r\nAll this to say, I support this PR.  If there\u2019s wording that needs tweaking, let\u2019s resolve it and get this PR merged.  No more ejecting or hacky workarounds for electron.  <!--\r\nThank you for sending the PR!\r\n\r\nIf you changed any code, please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work.

This ensures the notification will not just come the first time the sw is updated, but rather each refresh until it takes over. \r\n\r\nThe modified code was run in my local project, and the onUpdate did continue to show on each refresh until all tabs were closed, and the new sw took over.  /cc @jeffposnick  How to do force the update without closing all tabs? How to implement skipWaiting with CRA? That has to be done client side. skipWaiting would be called in the callback you provide for onUpdate, which would then post a message that client side code would have to receive, and then manually refresh.  But the event listener for the message to skipWaiting should be on the service worker file which is only available after build. Is there a way without touching the build files? To automatically have service workers skipWaiting, you\u2019d need to override the sw configuration using something like customize-cra  @arackaf Thank you, that's exactly what I need. I chatted with @arackaf about this logic and it looks \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nThanks for putting the PR together! @jeffposnick - just tweaked things to pass the updated sw to the onUpdate callback, so client code can postMessage to it.\r\n\r\nAnything blocking this from getting merged?  @arackaf regarding your statement about automatically `skipWaiting` for SW.... does this mean to have the behavior of: \"code has changed, have user refresh current tab for new content\" would need the customization of c-r-a? I.E. does that mean that C-R-A only supports updating content from a SW by closing the tab and reopening the app in a new tab? \u201cclosing and reopening the tab\u201d\r\n\r\nYeah, by default that\u2019s what the user has to do to get the new sw.  Once this pr is merged you\u2019ll be able to do something like this \r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/adamrackis/status/1060036913921449984?s=21  Can you update the TS version too, please? @Timer sorry?  There's a TS version of this same file? Where?  @arackaf Thanks for the quick answer! one other question if you dont mind: what does this mean in the context of installed apps on mobile homescreens?\r\ni.e. if an android user has added the app to homescreen, do they need to kill the running process to get the updated content?\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding the tweet you shared, I see that part of that solution involves updating the service-worker file itself to add the message event handler. So this would require using something to customize C-R-A's generated service-worker file? https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template-typescript/src/serviceWorker.ts @arackaf this PR only makes sense once you can customize you service worker to skip waiting. I saw your tweet, but don't understand where the code in the third screenshot is placed. I am trying to describe 2 scenarios which can be used in PWA app to show message, reload the app UI \r\n and install new service worker:\r\n\r\n- CASE 1: using `skipWaiting` config of WorkBox of WebPack plugin\r\nWhen user reopened the page or after `update` method has been called, state of new service worker would change to `installed` first and `activated` afterwards, but the app UI would be old one. **Showing a message which tells a user to reload the page would be useful.** \r\n\r\n- CASE 2: no `skipWaiting` config for WorkBox\r\nBased on [Advanced Recipes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/advanced-recipes), we can trigger `skipWaiting` and reload the page when service worker gets `activated`  *(not sure how it is possible with WorkBox Webpack Plugin)*, but in this method we can minimise time between updating service worker and updating UI. \r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n- CASE 1 requirements: \r\n  - `onUpdateActivated` event/callback\r\n- CASE 2 requirements: \r\n  - `onUpdateAvailable` event/callback\r\n  - `onUpdateActivated` event/callback\r\n\r\n**onUpdateAvailable/onUpdate callback**\r\nIt is exactly current `onUpdate` implementation.\r\n\r\n**onUpdateActivated/onActivated callback**  \r\nIt can be implemented in one of these ways:\r\n```\r\nnavigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('controllerchange\u2019, ()=>{})\r\n```\r\nOR\r\n```\r\nregistration.installing.onstatechange = () => {\r\n    if (registration.installing.state === \u2018activated\u2019) {}\r\n}\r\n``` @inssein screenshot #3 is code that you manually wire into the service worker via importScripts, via workbox configuration \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/arackaf/booklist/blob/master/react-redux/webpack.config.js#L116  @Timer sorry for the delay - how's that look?   > @inssein screenshot #3 is code that you manually wire into the service worker via importScripts, via workbox configuration\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/arackaf/booklist/blob/master/react-redux/webpack.config.js#L116\r\n\r\nYou can't do that without ejecting though, right? @inssein - ah, sorry, no need to eject - just a lil tweak is all you need :)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra#adjustworkboxfn  I am a bit confused why the toast with update notification needs to be in a service worker itself (referring to [the tweet](https://twitter.com/adamrackis/status/1060036913921449984?s=21)). Can it work other way around? Is it possible to get a notified in an actual app code when the update is pending and show the toast with app styling and glamour ideally with React?\r\n\r\nI mean there is a `sw.postMessage('sw-update-accepted')` which I assume can be invoked from the app code as well, is that correct? This message would be received by a workbox which does some magic to apply the update and `postMessage` back to the client to reload the app.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it correctly, I need to create a separate JS file which does the magic and then do this with `customize-cra`? Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\n```js\r\nadjustWorkbox(wb =>\r\n  Object.assign(wb, {\r\n    importScripts('executeUpdate.js')\r\n  })\r\n);\r\n```\r\n There does definitely need to be two-way communication with the Service Worker, and do you\u2019ll definitely need custom sw code imported (third screenshot).\r\n\r\nThe final message which is received, and shows the toast is in your app code though, so you can use whatever you want to show the message: React, Vue, etc etc. \r\n\r\ncc @jeffposnick - I get anything wrong? If https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1016 becomes a thing, then you won't have to do a back-and-forth between the `window` and service worker contexts. But since that proposal hasn't yet been implemented anywhere, the two-way communication is needed. Thanks a ton, Jeff.  I'd actually seen that proposal before - shocking imo it wasn't designed that way to begin with.  @Timer how's this look to you? We ready to merge?  Thanks, guys for putting this together, it was a big help and it's working nicely :) I am working on [react-workbox](https://github.com/NShahri/react-workbox) package, which lets you to use React components to show state of service-worker to the user.\r\nIt hides details of service-worker life cycle and provides UI components for different states.\r\n\r\nas a sample:\r\n```js\r\n<WorkBoxProvider interval={30 * 1000}>\r\n        <UpdateAvailable>\r\n            Custom message when update is available - (Activate the new version and refresh the page)\r\n        </UpdateAvailable>\r\n        <UpdateActivated>\r\n            Update is activated (Refresh the page)\r\n        </UpdateActivated>\r\n        {/* <UpdateActivatedReload /> Refresh the page when the new update is activated */}\r\n</WorkBoxProvider>\r\n``` @gaearon Hey Dan, anything I can do to help move this along? This is a major win to those of us out there that are using CRA + SW integration.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your time and please do let me know what I can do to help.

Maybe something is wrong with the V2 service worker? /cc @jeffposnick  Is this the expected behaviour? Does it happen only on localhost? When onUpdate gets called I would like to add a popup which prompts the user to reload the page. Yes -- the expected behavior is that you must close all tabs or browser before the new content appears. This is the behavior everywhere, not just on `localhost`.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to override this via `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting()` but you need to make sure you coordinate this across *all* instances of your apps running in their browser. May we convert this into a \"doc improvement\" issue so that we keep track of this? I think the current documentation should at least mention it. Yeah we should probably note this in https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#offline-first-considerations In the meantime I found this: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin `skipWaiting: true` does the job. Yes, this does warrant improvements to the v2 docs. I can tackle that next week.\r\n\r\nFYI, https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3613#issuecomment-353467430 is the best explanation of why defaulting `skipWaiting` to `false` was the safest thing to do for `c-r-a` v2.\r\n\r\ntl;dr is that if `skipWaiting` is `true` and you lazy-load resources, there's a decent chance that you might end up trying to lazy-load a URL that no longer exists in the service worker's cache or on the server. If you *don't* lazy-load versioned URLs and you want the old behavior, then changing your config to using `skipWaiting: true` is the alternative. @gabrielmicko , @jeffposnick , Can the `skipWaiting: true` option be applied without ejecting? On [this line](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/183efedb42333df5fdcf987df4f6cfa0f855f845/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js#L512) the [workbox-webpack-plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin) is registered with `clientsClaim: true` and the documentation for `workbox-webpack-plugin`'s `skipWaiting` option says\r\n\r\n> Whether or not the service worker should skip over the waiting lifecycle stage. Normally this is used with `clientsClaim: true`.\r\n\r\nShould the default behaviour be setting `clientsClaim: true` and `skipWaiting: true`? @mymattcarroll yes, that way you get the update asap. For now I don't know how am I going to get a callback about the update onUpdate seems to be broken if skipWaiting is set to true. I'll take a look later.\r\nAlso I don't know how I can add skipWaiting: true without hacking in the node_modules. Any idea? Finally I was able to test with \"react-scripts\": \"^1.1.0\". Actually it works how it should!\r\n```\r\nserviceWorker.register({\r\n   onUpdate:() => {\r\n       //Some UI notification comes here, then reload\r\n       window.location.reload();\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nOnce it reloads, I instantly see the change, whereas in create-react-app v2 I won't. I guess this is something that has to be addressed. Please at least make it configurable.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserviceWorker.register({\r\n    skipWaiting: true\r\n    onUpdate:() => {\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis case onUpdate would instantly fire once skipWaiting() get's called.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n/cc @jeffposnick \r\n\r\nEdit: actually I am a little confused if it could be added to serviceWorker.js file. Cause I guess it has to be in the service-worker.js. @gabrielmicko, it will have to be a build time configuration as it needs to be added to the webpack configuration [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/183efedb42333df5fdcf987df4f6cfa0f855f845/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js#L512).\r\n\r\nPerhaps configuration in `package.json`? The `package.json` is already being used for build time configuration using the `browserlist` property. Maybe something like: \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"serviceWorkerOptions\": {\r\n    \"skipWaiting\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` @mymattcarroll This would be awesome. Other questions is how do you let serviceWorker.js know that skipWaiting has been called? The developer want's to subscribe to that event, so he can let the users know there was an update. @Timer, it seems the default behaviour of the service worker has changed between v1 and v2. Our project is no longer hitting [this line](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v2.0.4/packages/react-scripts/template/src/serviceWorker.js#L72) to allow us to prompt the user when new content is available by just refreshing the current page. \r\n\r\nWas this intentional?\r\n\r\nIf it was, I have been able to make changes to a local fork to get v1 behaviour to occur again by making the following changes:\r\n1. Updating the [`serviceWorker.js`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v2.0.4/packages/react-scripts/template/src/serviceWorker.js) check the `event` object passed to `registration.installing.onstatechange` instead of checking `registration.installing.state` (it seemed there was a race condition where multiple state changes were occurring so fast that `registration.installing.state` was always equal to `'activated'`)\r\n1. Updating [`webpack.config.prod.js`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js#L512) to pass `skipWaiting: true` to [workbox-webpack-plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin) configuration\r\n\r\nI would be happy to contribute with a pull request if you believe these changes are desirable for others.\r\n\r\nIf setting `skipWaiting: true` by default is not desirable, would you consider a configuration option, perhaps in `package.json`? I would be happy to work on making the UX similar to how the `browserslist` property is added to `package.json` with a prompt.\r\n\r\nThis library is awesome, would hate to consider ejecting... Very well said @mymattcarroll! This is what I realised as well! I guess the default behaviour should match v1 so that devs would not need to change anything!  So I had mistakenly thought that being able to override the default Workbox options via an external config file had made it into `c-r-a` v2 branch, but as per https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5111#issuecomment-425458687 that was just a proposal and not actually something that landed.\r\n\r\nThat would allow folks who feel comfortable with the tradeoffs around potentially buggy lazy-loading to opt-in to using `skipWaiting: true`, and get a quicker update flow.\r\n\r\nI've filed separate issue to track the addition of that config file: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5359 I'm in favor of adding a `cra.config.js` for these config and others, overriding default ones!\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it could already be done. @mymattcarroll\r\n\r\n> Can the skipWaiting: true option be applied without ejecting?\r\n\r\nThis is the hacky way I had to do it\r\ninstall replace-in-file\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --save-dev replace-in-file\r\n```\r\n\r\ncreate a file in the root called `hack-add-skipWaiting-true-to-react-script.js`\r\n**UPDATE\r\nChanged webpack-config.prod.js to webpack-config.js since the file is renamed in current version**  \r\n```javascript\r\n'use strict';\r\nconst replace = require('replace-in-file');\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    console.log('Adding skipWaiting: true to react-script webpack-config.js');\r\n    replace.sync({\r\n        files: 'node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js',\r\n        from: /clientsClaim: true,$/gm,\r\n        to: (match) => {\r\n            return match + ' skipWaiting: true,';\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n} catch (e) {\r\n    console.log('Something went wrong when trying to add skipWaiting: true to react-script webpack-config.js', e);\r\n    process.exit();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd it as a postinstall script to your `package.json`\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"start\": \"react-scripts start\",\r\n    \"build\": \"react-scripts build\",\r\n    \"test\": \"react-scripts test\",\r\n    \"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\",\r\n    \"postinstall\": \"node hack-add-skipWaiting-true-to-react-script.js\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nrun `npm install` and skipWaiting should now be set to true Very sneaky @andidev ;)\r\n\r\nI have rolled back to `react-scripts@1.1.5` for now in the hope #5369 gets accepted. If you use react-app-rewired it is fairly easy to achieve this. I can post it if somebody wants it. > If you use react-app-rewired it is fairly easy to achieve this. I can post it if somebody wants it.\r\n\r\nThat'd be good but isn't react-app-wired deprecated on CRA v2.0? @kevinOriginal nope, the message on their repo is confusing. It works just fine, it's just that the utilities used to inject your own configuration work just on V1. But you can either write the code yourself or use the ones provided by customize-cra This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

This seems far too confusing to the 'average use-case' of developers wanting to enable SW to just allow for PWA behavior on mobile. My recommendation is to make SW non-cache friendly by-default to getting cache-stuck. I've got my app somewhat working with CRA2 via following \"Offer a page reload for users\": https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/advanced-recipes\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to send a message to CRA2's auto-generated SW, I use an npm script to append the below lines to the created worker after its built:\r\n```\r\nself.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\r\n  if (!event.data){\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  switch (event.data) {\r\n    case 'skipWaiting':\r\n      self.skipWaiting();\r\n      break;\r\n    default:\r\n      // NOOP\r\n      break;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd recommend adding this into the default generated SW as this technique is considered best practice for updating SW apps.\r\n > If you use react-app-rewired it is fairly easy to achieve this.

It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n Can you guys just disable this stupid bot please? FWIW, I wrote a simple [craco](https://github.com/sharegate/craco) plugin called [craco-workbox](https://github.com/kevinsperrine/craco-workbox) to handle this in CRA2 until #5369 gets merged.  No, @stale. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

I'd like to second this.\r\n\r\nI'm currently looking at a way to define it using a `react-app-rewired` approach but it seems that the option is burried deep. \ud83d\udd73 \r\n\r\nI ended up here : https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app/create.js#L95-L103\r\n\r\nIt would be great to add the [pragma](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#pragma) option here and to give us a parameter / env variable to set it properly. \ud83d\ude04\r\n\r\nThis would be enough so we can hook into the webpack config and pass the option from a rewired plugin : \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"presets\": [[\"react-app\", { \"flow\": true, \"typescript\": false, pragma: 'myCustomPragma' }]]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT** :\r\n\r\nWe can actually make it works today by redefining `@babel/transform-react-jsx` in the webpack config as plugins are executed before presets (so before the `react-app` preset used by CRA). It requires [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired/) and [customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra) if you don't want to eject.\r\n\r\nIn term of dependencies to add : \r\n```bash\r\nyarn add --dev @wordpress/babel-plugin-import-jsx-pragma babel-plugin-emotion@next babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx\r\n```\r\n\r\n`babel-plugin-emotion` is not required.\r\n\r\nHere is the `config-overrides.js` :\r\n```js\r\nconst { override, addBabelPlugin } = require('customize-cra')\r\nmodule.exports = override(\r\n  addBabelPlugin(['emotion', options]),\r\n   addBabelPlugin([\r\n      '@wordpress/babel-plugin-import-jsx-pragma',\r\n      {\r\n        scopeVariable: 'jsx',\r\n        source: '@emotion/core',\r\n        isDefault: false\r\n      }\r\n    ]),\r\n   addBabelPlugin([\r\n      '@babel/transform-react-jsx',\r\n      {\r\n        pragma: 'jsx'\r\n      }\r\n    ])\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still think it would be better to have a proper API from CRA rather than relying on webpack's execution priority.\r\n I wonder if we could use the Yarn `resolutions` to override `@babel/transform-react-jsx` with a custom made \"transform-emotion-jsx\"?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"resolutions\": {\r\n  \"@babel/transform-react-jsx\": \"@emotion/transform-emotion-jsx\" // fake package name\r\n}\r\n``` This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity.

An option of this kind would allow to use also other React-like libraries such as Preact.\r\n\r\nHonestly I wouldn't dismiss this issue that quickly, but I guess it's up to you. Something like https://github.com/sharegate/craco/ might enable the custom config you want.  `webpack.base.conf.js` wrote as below:\r\n\r\n> ```js\r\n> resolve: {\r\n>     extensions: ['.js', '.vue', '.json'],\r\n>     alias: {\r\n>       '@': resolve('src'),\r\n>     }\r\n>  },\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/blob/master/template/build/webpack.base.conf.js#L40\r\n\r\nCan we use `import Hello from '@/components/Hello'` like vue?\r\n Place `NODE_PATH=src` into your `.env` file and proceed to import `components/Hello`. I\u2019d say let\u2019s just add `@` support. I was resistant because I thought we\u2019d do monorepos sooner. But since that was shelved we might as well do what Vue does.  We'll need to make sure it works with webpack (obviously), but also Jest/Flow/ESLint(?). Can we just create `node_modules/@` and link it? @gaearon Why does monorepos affect `@` support? If we had monorepo support we\u2019d encourage people to put different top level folders into separate packages instead of having a special way to refer to the root.  By the way, our individual packages in monorepo, if we don't want to publish it to NPM, how should it be named?  Doesn't matter. @gaearon \r\n\r\n> If we had monorepo support we\u2019d encourage people to put different top level folders into separate packages instead of having a special way to refer to the root.\r\n\r\nI think even with monorepo, we still need a special way to refer to the root.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we needs two axios instances, it would be unreasonable for us to put these strongly business-relevant codes in separate packages. @gaearon any update on this? The simplest way to achieve this is to create `node_modules/@` and link it as @gaearon suggested. You could do this by adding a `postinstall` script to your `package.json`. Like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  // ...\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"preinstall\": \"rm node_modules/@\",\r\n    \"postinstall\": \"ln -s `pwd`/src node_modules/@\",\r\n    // ...\r\n  },\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n If we would proceed with this would `NODE_PATH` support be dropped? Because I\u2019d prefer that over any prefix symbol. I also think for people new to JS/React an absolute path like `components/button` feels natural while something like `@/components/button` is yet another thing they need to learn and needs to be explained.  @rovansteen I personally prefer an explicit symbol so that I can tell whether the imports come from the application code or a node module. If `@` looks weird, you may try with: `src`, `@src`, `app`, `@app`, ... instead. @tanduong it's not about that the `@` looks weird it's about that it is not a common pattern for paths. Relative paths starting with a `.` and absolute paths not starting with a dot is a much more common pattern. You could then argue if the absolute path should be the root directory of the application or the `src` directory. If you'd go with the root directory you do have the benefit of having to \"prefix\" all of your absolute imports of your application code with `src`. I don't know if there's any upside/downside of `NODE_PATH` vs. webpack alias if you go with `src` as the prefix. Is there any IDE support on this for proper auto-complete etc?\r\n\r\nDidn't see such practice on corporate projects before. But relative paths are very annoying indeed. @z-ax definitely IDEs auto-complete and indexing will become an issue.\r\n\r\nEven in Vue, I didn't use this.\r\n\r\nIt sounds good, it looks good, but in practice becomes an issue. @z-ax \r\nFor js file\uff0cwe can write a fake webpack config, see https://github.com/umijs/umi/issues/1109 \r\nFor ts file, we can use paths in tsconfig, see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5645 > Is there any IDE support on this for proper auto-complete etc?\r\n> \r\n> Didn't see such practice on corporate projects before. But relative paths are very annoying indeed.\r\n\r\nVS Code at least supports jsconfig.json which uses the exact same \"paths\" options as tsconfig to tell the editor how to resolve paths.\r\n\r\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig\r\n\r\nSo far as I can tell, TypeScript **does not** support NODE_PATH. I was adopting TypeScript in an existing CRA app relying on NODE_PATH, and tsconfig's path options saved me from running into a big blocker while CRA's typescript support was in beta.\r\n\r\n@tanduong's proposal for a filesystem link isn't OS independent, so now I'm stalled trying to figure out what to do with a project I over optimistically started porting over to typescript and is just completely broken ATM\r\n\r\nedit: Using a collage of packages (rimraf, lnk-cli, globstar), I think I have a cross environment happy pre/post install setup that seems to be mostly working\r\n\r\n```\r\nscripts: {\r\n\t\t\"preinstall\": \"yarn unlink-modules\",\r\n\t\t\"postinstall\": \"yarn link-modules\",\r\n\t\t\"unlink-modules\": \"rimraf node_modules/@\",\r\n\t\t\"link-modules\": \"globstar --node -- lnk \\\"./src/*\\\" \\\"./node_modules/@/\\\"\",\r\n\t\t\"relink-modules\": \"yarn unlink-modules && yarn link-modules\",\r\n\t\t// ...\r\n}\r\n``` @fooey your `prescript` doesn't work for the first installing without `node_modules` if `rimraf` doesn't exist in global packages > @fooey your `prescript` doesn't work for the first installing without `node_modules` if `rimraf` doesn't exist in global packages\r\n\r\n@orlov-vo good catch. I always have rimraf installed globally and didn't think of that. Maybe getting rid of the preinstall and having the postinstall do the combined relink would be fine. I'll have to take another stab at it tonight. I have just discovered that this script is very dangerous if you are using Yarn:\r\n```\r\n\"postinstall\": \"ln -s `pwd`/src node_modules/@\",\r\n```\r\nYarn thinks it owns `node_modules` and can clear it out at will, for example when upgrading a package. That in itself isn't fatal, as it's easy enough to run the `postinstall` again. However, Yarn thinks any `node_modules` directory starting with `@` is a scope and it carefully recurses one level down to delete any content. The result: goodbye `src` directory. :-( The issue is described here:\r\nhttps://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5709\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform alternative above doesn't seem to suffer from the same problem:\r\n```\r\n\"link-modules\": \"globstar --node -- lnk \\\"./src/*\\\" \\\"./node_modules/@/\\\"\",\r\n```\r\n...as it creates multiple links one level below `node_modules/@`. For those, who are still looking for a solution have a look at this [small repo](https://github.com/unzico/cra-2-typescript-sass-antd). It supports create-react-app v2.x, TypeScript v3.x, and absolute path imports.\r\nThis is achieved by using [craco](https://github.com/sharegate/craco) and extending the `tsconfig.json` file. This is very disappointing. I am using CRA + TypeScript for almost a year (using `react-scripts-ts`). I was excited that CRA now supports TS out of the box but this is a blocker for me. I think CRA should stay a scaffolding tool rather than some sort of overlooking entity, forcing me to setup my project in a certain way. I don't want to eject or use another tool for config overriding just to do a basic setup. Messing around I just found one setting that works without `craco` for the absolute paths:\r\n\r\n1 - Update `.env` file to `NODE_PATH=./`;\r\n\r\n2 - Create one `tsconfig.paths.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"src/*\": [\"src/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3 - Add this as your first entry in `tsconfig.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"extends\": \"./tsconfig.paths.json\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow everything should work fine, just reference the `src/` folder in your imports instead of `@`.\r\n\r\nYES, CRA will complain about the `tsconfig.json` absolute paths and stuff, but... VSCode seems to work pretty well with it and I think other IDEs will just as well.\r\n\r\nEDIT: CRA complains but don't really remove the lines because it extends from the `paths.json` file so it can't modify it! @zaguiini Yes, it works for absolute path. Sadly, this doesn't solve the alias problem. \r\n\r\nI'm seriously thinking about ejecting. Right at the point, where I started to think that CRA is becoming less opinionated and more open to configuration, this feels like a knife in the back. There appears to be some confusion in other threads so I'll repeat my comment from https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5585:\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nJust to be clear \u2014 **we do want to support absolute paths**.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we want to:\r\n\r\n* **Make `NODE_PATH` work for TS.** (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5692)\r\n* **Make `@` alias work by default for everyone \u2014 both in JS and TS.** (this issue)\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the frustration this is causing. We're not asking you to convert your code to use relative paths \u2014 but please wait for either of these two issues to resolve.\r\n There is also another plausible alternative \u2014 we could embrace `tsconfig.json` / [`jsconfig.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig), and make `paths` specified there work across the setup (Webpack/Jest). See https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5645#issuecomment-451170386 for that. `tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json` specify a `baseUrl` too. This is [one of the items](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5692) on the list of things to do along with this issue. If CRA embraces the `paths` option, can it embrace the `baseUrl` as well? Probably \u2014 let's discuss in https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5645? I don't fully understand what this entails. what about...

That means that they **support** things like async/await, classes, arrow functions, fetch etc., which allows us to skip a lot of transpilation and polyfills and therefore build less verbose code, which should be faster to parse and run.\r\n\r\nFor more in depth explanation I recommend reading this great [article](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/) by @philipwalton.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nIt's based on my recent PR - https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/4852, which switches from unmaintained uglify-es to terser.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is inspired by an awesome work of the Vue team - [link](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/browser-compatibility.html#modern-mode).\r\n\r\nA new `--modern` flag is added to a `build` command.\r\n\r\nCode is built twice using webpack's [multi-compiler](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler). Firstly it's built using current configuration, secondly with `babel-preset-env` targets option set to [esmodules](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-preset-env.html#targetsesmodules).\r\n\r\nThen script tags in `index.html` are concatenated with correct attributes - `type=\"module\"` for modern code and `nomodule` (+ safari fix) for legacy code.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\nFor this PR I decided to go with webpack's `multi-compiler`, so I didn't have to modify `build` command, but if we decide to ship it to CRA, I would separate it to two separate builds to improve overall DX (making in it clear what's being built, better handling of messages, diff between legacy and modern assets). \r\n\r\nPotentially extracting webpack plugin to separate module and making it less naive.\r\n\r\nOther improvements could be to add support for [rel=preload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content), but I think it's out of scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nThere are some small improvements already when I tried that on the base template:\r\n```\r\n  38.01 KB  build/static/js/vendors.c5915f63.chunk.js\r\n  31.58 KB  build/static/js/vendors.8f7a7647.chunk.m.js\r\n\r\n  1.74 KB   build/static/js/main.9f0bbc18.chunk.js\r\n  1.01 KB   build/static/js/main.f6d883db.chunk.m.js\r\n\r\n  619 B     build/static/js/runtime~main.6dc408cf.m.js\r\n  617 B     build/static/js/runtime~main.41117e05.js\r\n\r\n  257 B     build/static/css/main.5c4bc340.chunk.css\r\n  257 B     build/static/css/main.72f56e40.chunk.css\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a little custom configuration I was able to build [Spectrum](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) (cc @mxstbr):\r\n```\r\n  337.59 KB  build/static/js/vendors.a558cfde.chunk.js\r\n  323.47 KB  build/static/js/vendors.5f3218c3.chunk.m.js\r\n\r\n  186.38 KB  build/static/js/main.e89ef961.chunk.js\r\n  165.06 KB  build/static/js/main.64166e32.chunk.m.js\r\n\r\n  25.92 KB   build/static/js/Splash.46e74c85.chunk.js\r\n  23.87 KB   build/static/js/Splash.7ffab923.chunk.m.js\r\n\r\n  17.47 KB   build/static/js/communitySettings.0ac076e5.chunk.js\r\n  13.56 KB   build/static/js/communitySettings.22122a1f.chunk.m.js\r\n\r\n  11.54 KB   build/static/js/Thread.91502d68.chunk.js\r\n  10 KB      build/static/js/Thread.cb8fdd14.chunk.m.js\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile building Spectrum I found out that template literals are not minified, so size differences are not that huge.\r\n\r\n## Try it out\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/prichodko/create-react-app.git\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ncd create-react-app/packages/react-scripts\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nyarn link\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\ncd ~/your-project\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nyarn link react-scripts\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\nyarn build --modern\r\n```\r\n This is really neat, @prichodko! Thanks for putting this together.\r\n\r\nI don't believe we're opposed to adding something like this, though I'm not sure if we'd want it behind a flag or on by default (assuming it works with backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\nDan and I should have more time to focus on CRA in the coming weeks, so you'll likely hear much more from us soon. Great to hear that @Timer. \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\nThen, in upcoming days, I will write down my thoughts on how the final implementation could look like (so maybe other folks could chime in).  @gaearon not considering anymore? @Timer ? Accident :-) Another use-case to consider is dev vs. production builds. I'm gonna go nuts if I have to step through the regenerator runtime in a debugger again today. Except relatively rare cases of downlevel testing or debugging, developers will always be on a modern browser.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to configure CRA when in Dev mode to produce only ESnext (no ES5) so I won't have to pay the time and battery-life price of compiling ES5 dev builds that I'll never use. \r\n\r\nIt's an interesting question of whether ES6-only should be the default for dev mode. Might be worth it if it saves a lot of build time in the default case. \r\n\r\nFeel free to ignore this feedback if compiling to ES5 and ESnext (as opposed to just ESnext) is really fast at build time.  Any update to this PR? When will this feature be released? Hey, \r\n\r\nLet me start off by saying the bundle size diff would be bigger if libraries would ship a `.modern` bundle, discussed [here](https://github.com/developit/microbundle/issues/304).\r\n\r\nI also have a start to develop a feature like the following [here](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/POC-ModularLegacyBuild)\r\n\r\nMy POC however is not ideal to be set up on a large scale that is why we should have to integrate it into some plugin/webpack.\r\n\r\nThis being said, I support OP's notion to divide this into two seperate builds rather than making it into one huge multi compiled thing. This however makes it harder to make your .html file.\r\n\r\nIs there anything holding this feature back, I would love to help on it where I can.\r\n\r\nEDIT: in my POC I wrote a script for the shim and sliding in the bundles but apparently there's a neat plugin for this:  https://github.com/firsttris/html-webpack-multi-build-plugin\r\n\r\nThis way we can include the multiple bundles and the shim, so this could be included in the webpack config. I assume we just need to find how we would be able to add a build when --modern is added.  ### Is this a bug report?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nThis is related to #3814\r\n\r\nWe embedded a CRA-created app within another, larger app and would like to be able to adjust the host/port combination the webpack dev server/client use to connect to each other.\r\n\r\n**Our use case:** the CRA-created app is a new frontend for a part of an existing application and requires authentication to access. Authentication is done via a session / cookie and therefore requests from the CRA-created app are required to send the session cookie alongside. This can be achieved in other ways than living on the same host/port combination as the \"host\" application but just serving it directly from the \"host\" application is certainly the easiest way when you don't have an existing SSO endpoint. \r\n\r\n**The problem:** We run the dev server alongside the \"host\" application. We access `/static/js/bundle.js` via `http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js` in an HTML file served by the \"host\" application (e.g. on host/port `example.com:80`). When accessing that HTML file served by the host application, the JS is loaded successfully. It then tries to connect to the webpack dev server on `http://example.com/sockjs-node/...` which is not working obviously because the dev server is running on `localhost:3000`. \r\n\r\nWe can successfully develop using that setup, just the dev server/hot reloading is not working.\r\n\r\nI assume this would need one adjustement in `react-dev-scripts` to accept an env variable to connect to the dev server. Maybe we also need to adjust something based on an env variable in the dev webpack config. \r\n\r\nIs this feature out of scope for CRA or would you be open for a PR?\r\n\r\nA minimal reproducible example to show this:\r\n1. create a new CRA app\r\n2. run `yarn start` / `npm start`\r\n3. create somewhere a new directory with just an `index.html` containing the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\">\r\n  <title>React App</title>\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n  <div id=\"root\"></div>\r\n  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js\"></script></body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. use a static HTML server like [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) for that directory and access it.\r\n5. you'll notice the react app gets served correctly, webpack-dev-server related requests fail because they go to the wrong host/port combination. There are [Advanced Configuration Docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#advanced-configuration).\r\nTake a look at `HOST` and `PORT`. @miraage I'm aware of `HOST` and `PORT` but that doesn't help in this case.\r\nIt could be you misunderstood the issue description, I'll try to explain it differently:\r\n\r\n- CRA-App is started using `npm start` listening on `http://localhost:3000`\r\n- Host-App is started, listening on `http://example.local`\r\n- Browser accesses `http://example.local/cra-app` which contains the HTML I posted above\r\n- Browser gets `bundle.js` from CRA dev server (`http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js`)\r\n- After the bundle is downloaded, it tries to establish a websocket (sockjs) connection to `window.location.hostname` / `window.location.port` which is in this case `example.local` and port 80\r\n\r\nTherefore the bundle tries to connect to the wrong host/port combination because the dev server only listens on `localhost:3000`. \r\n\r\nIs this now more easily understandable? Running into the exact same problem where I need to have SocketJS connect to something other than what is found in window.location.\r\n Running into this issue as well with a similar setup. If I just go into \"node_modules\" and edit webpackHotDevClient.js to fix the websocket port, then it works. You get basically the same thing as the auto-reloading page from \"npm start\" except servable from a backend app (it also means you can template the index.html with a backend framework).\r\n\r\nI think ideally the port (and maybe host) that I modified locally in webpackHotDevClient.js would be configurable. I would love to know why this is still an issue, as [this isn't the only issue open for it](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3814).\r\n\r\nThe logic thrown about in that other issue astounds me; exposing a defaulted port/host combo for this will in no way make weird or otherwise unwanted compromises for end-users. I've worked with enough people where ejecting is the norm, and this is consistently a pain point that nobody seems to want to press CRA about much because they've indicated it won't change. Just wanted to leave another vote for this feature.\r\n\r\nI'm integrating a CRA app into a .NET MVC app, so like others I am running the app from a different port.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't even have to be configurable, the port in webpackHotDevClient.js just needs to use the same port as the dev server, then it would continue to work for the 99% of users who don't care about this, and would work for those of us trying to integrate CRA apps into another app. This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n We had the same issue as we would integrate a CRA app into another application through an iframe. I don't really understand why this rather easy fix can't be integrated. We are running into this issue as well. In our case, it is because we are running two separate projects on the same domain, and the one using this feature is on a subpath using a reverse proxy. ProjectA runs on http://mysite.local and ProjectB (which uses CRA) runs on http://mysite.local/sub, which is reverse proxied to localhost:9090. I would love to be able to tell webpackHotDevClient to use localhost:9090 as the hostname/port. This feature clearly has interest, and doesn't add complexity. What are the objections with implementing it?\r\n\r\n> I think ideally the port (and maybe host) that I modified locally in webpackHotDevClient.js would be configurable.\r\n\r\n@jylin I edited the port and that worked initially, but if I update my code the second request is back to localhost:3000. Did you have to edit anything other than [these lines?](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-dev-utils/webpackHotDevClient.js#L63-L65l)\r\n Running into this issue as well. For reference webpack-dev-server's client has a nice solution to this: [it uses the host/port in the url of the `<script>` tag](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/v3.1.9/client-src/default/index.js#L30-L39) that loaded the bundle.\r\n\r\nCould we do something similar here? This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had any recent activity. It will be closed in 5 days if no further activity occurs.\n > For reference webpack-dev-server's client has a nice solution to this: [it uses the host/port in the url of the `<script>` tag](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/v3.1.9/client-src/default/index.js#L30-L39) that loaded the bundle.\r\n\r\nHappy to send a PR to do something similar here, but I'd like the approach to be approved by a maintainer first. :)\r\n This issue has been automatically closed because it has not had any recent activity.

I'd recommend you to ask somebody from https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS#L1  The workaround that removes `--watch` if `--coverage` is present in the test command will no longer be needed when https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/5601 is merged and released.\r\n\r\n<del># Do not merge this yet</del>\r\n\r\n<del>I will update the PR once it's part of a stable jest release \ud83d\ude04 </del> @stipsan looks like jest@23 would have this change? @bugzpodder correct!

Sorry I was away and racked up 300 notifications from this repo :)\r\n@mrmckeb, traditionally jest didn't work with --coverage and --watch in the same command until @stipsan fixed it: https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/5601\r\nBut this wasn't introduced until jest@23 was released as part of CRA.\r\n\r\nI tested this after jest@23 with --findRelatedTests and --coverage but it still broke occasionally so I had to disable this particular set of flags in our CI build.  But I imagine this would happen rarely and I am ok with seeing this PR go through.  I'll let you guys deal with the potential breaking change part. OK, so we've just merged in a change to allow `no-watch`, which I think will help with this #6285 - but it's definitely a breaking change, so I don't think it can be in a minor release.\r\n\r\n@stipsan can you please rebase? We'll need to wait for #6278 to merge first.  <!--\r\n  PLEASE READ THE FIRST SECTION :-)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is this a bug report?\r\n\r\nNo, it's refactoring proposal\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It\u2019s fine if you\u2019re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnvironment specific behavior should be configured in one single `webpack.config.js` file\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere are two configuration files `webpack.config.dev.js` and `webpack.config.prod.js`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\n* Mostly the only reason for ejecting is need to customize WebPack config file.\r\n* Both files must be edited in near same way.
