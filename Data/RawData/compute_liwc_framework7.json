[{"repo": "framework7", "type": "elite", "title": "", "number of text": 1841, "text": "  You're going to need to explain jQuery namespaces Unless @nolimits4web knows otherwise Dom7 doesn't support this.\r\n\r\nIs there no alternatives you could use?  Same requirement, put there View with pages/page and init it You may probably need to set fixed height size on this View inside of modal  Webpack doesn't allow to include styles depending on device user agent. Just add it manually with simple condition directly in document HEAD\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<head>\r\n  ...\r\n  <script>\r\n    (function () {\r\n      var ios = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(window.navigator.userAgent);\r\n      if (ios) {\r\n        document.write(\r\n          '<link href=\"/path/to/framework.ios.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />' +\r\n          '<link href=\"/path/to/framework.ios.colors.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />'\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n      else {\r\n        document.write(\r\n          '<link href=\"/path/to/framework.material.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />' +\r\n          '<link href=\"/path/to/framework.material.colors.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />'\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    })();\r\n  </script>\r\n</head>  That's because you should listen for the `ajax:error` event.\r\n\r\nOr if using `$.ajax` set the `error` or `statusCode` argument in that case the callback itself should contain a try { } catch () { }  Same as #1413  iNoBounce  ```js\r\nvar modal = $$('.open-modal').on('click', function () {\r\n  myApp.modal({\r\n    title:  'Native submit test',\r\n    text: '<form method=\"post\" id=\"form\"><input type=\"text\"><input type=\"submit\"></form>',\r\n    buttons: [\r\n      {\r\n        text: 'Submit',\r\n        onClick: function() {\r\n          myApp.alert('Submitted!');\r\n         // I have a very long code to do here <-----------[!]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n$$(modal).find('form').on('submit', function (e) {\r\n  e.preventDefault();\r\n  $$(modal).find('.modal-button').click();\r\n});\r\n```  The problem seems to be that the content is too tall that's irrelevant how would Swiper know that that would put it off the top of the screen.\r\n\r\nYou should insure that your content will fit There is something wrong with the layout. Would be good to know how to replicate this issue or see the Fiddle with the issue or live example  `onPageBeforeAnimation` is probably the best way to go.\r\n\r\n@nolimits4web we probably need a better way to handle this  @nolimits4web for V2 we probably need to rethink the way initial pages work as we keep getting issues likes this.\r\n\r\n@snakeman21 have you tried manually calling `.init()` and are you aware that initial content is *not* fetched through ajax @snakeman21 can you show an example of what you are trying to achieve?  Use correct view->pages->page layout inside of popup to make it work https://jsfiddle.net/fys92vyj/  Try\r\n```js\r\na.className = 'external no-fastclick';  Would be good to see live example or JSFiddle with the issue  [Material Guidlines](https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html) & [iOS HIG](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-bars/tab-bars/) shows tab labels as simply having the first letter capitalised  Would be good to know is it actual for Material theme? iOS theme is not designed to be used on Androids  See #1439  `/dist/js/framework7.js` was last generated 9 days ago and @nolimits4web pushed the feature 8 days ago.\r\n\r\nAs for being released 'officially' i imagine within a couple of weeks but you can build it yourself if you need it now Install node.js and follow the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7#build) @krosoftware use Build instructions from README and use JS/CSS files from `build/` folder Have you installed node.js? Which version of Windows are you running? If 8, 8.1 or 10 open File Explorer to wherever you cloned Framework7 to and run `npm install -g gulp` that makes gulp available globally then `npm install` downloads F7's dependencies locally with `gulp build` building it  ## Looks good to me\r\nbut *why* are we talking in **headings**? @razekteixeira you can add further commits to the PR feel free to do so. Whilst i understand your point i think that may be overcomplicating it.\r\n Per popup is fine, i was referring to the \"Should we give the possibility to ignore close on outside click and the developer must have some event to close the popover manually or is this something we should discuss first?\" Looks good, thanks  Like so:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17074021/24206791/37bacd9a-0f17-11e7-80f6-022abc7a5d20.png)\r\n Guess @nolimits4web fixed it in master already @ZanderBrown yes, it is already fixed in Master  http://framework7.io/docs/page-callbacks.html#callbacks-for-initial-pages  Thanks  Or set initial URL (`url: 'index.html'`) parameter for the view when you initialize it  Template7 / preprocess / PHP / ASP maybe more suitable than onPageInit  Seems to work for me. Can anyone confirm? Works for me as well i'll rebuild later but at present yes Okay, on Master branch issue was presented. Fixed by e748fee0c03442bf56730ab3de6ddd2f6d238e81 Okay then reopening Fixed by dd5eed0397d7a6fd81b0a7d30d1ac3e762f234f2  Define\r\n\r\n> IE 11 does not support Web Apps I don't currently have access to IE11 but using [IE NetRenderer](https://netrenderer.com/index.php) to load [Kitchen Sink](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-ios/) produces:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17074021/24093400/8876f236-0d4b-11e7-9198-18bcbbdcd6c8.png)\r\n Are you sure it is related to F7? I see your errors are because of none supported \"Object.assign\" method. F7 doesn't use this method  Would be good to have a CodePen / jsFiddle. If you mean the native iOS Safari swipe back functionality when browsing app in browser (rather than in Cordova or Home Screen app) then it is not possible to disable it  Would it be better to open an issue over at @valnub 's repo? Yes, it is better to ask it in appropriate place  Can anyone confirm? I see the video is by @valnub  Not being familiar with vue i wouldn't know.\r\n\r\n@nolimits4web any thoughts? We can close it. Just keep correct layout structure and it should be fine  I'm not sure it fits with the iOS HIG.\r\nThat said if you can provide an example i'll happily add the iOS label I'm afraid YouTube is a bad example as it follows material styles  Whoa can we have a description? A CodePen/jsFiddle?\r\n\r\nWhen opening issues **please** follow the template provided  Merged, thanks Ok, i have to revert this fix as it is brakes touch detection where it is supported  Months, as is standard in most languages including JavaScript, starts at 0\r\n\r\nSo\r\n\r\n| Month | Value |\r\n| --- | -- |\r\n| January | 0 |\r\n| February | 1 |\r\n| March | 2 |\r\n| April | 3 |\r\n| May | 4 |\r\n| June | 5 |\r\n| July | 6 |\r\n| August | 7 |\r\n| September | 8 |\r\n| October | 9 |\r\n| November | 10 |\r\n| December |  11 |  `document.createElement('tag')` to make elements, `elm.appendChild(otherelm)` to put elements inside elements ect..\r\n\r\nOr look at Template7\r\n\r\nPast that it's your job to design the logic  As `$$('img').trigger('lazy');` manually triggers lazy load does `$$('img').on('lazy', function () {});` not work? Interesting. Still i think an event is the better way to handle this Merged, thanks. Also added few events/callbacks at f78045edf01f012a511bf5275d6c0d440befd029  Interesting, can you provide some code? Not sure what happens but looks like device rendering issue. Do you see same issue on another android device, have you tried to use Crosswalk?  @nolimits4web any thoughts on this and #1338 ? It looks like something wrong with the layout, will be good to see example or fiddle with the issue as it doesn't happen in default demos and examples  Whats with the 'MDL' in the issue title?\r\n\r\nDo you mean that two dates are selected or just the wrong one?\r\n\r\nCould you provide a screencast or a jsFiddle/CodePen with steps to reproduce? Can't reproduce.\r\n\r\nWhat's your device name & useragent string @vousys are you using latest 1.5.4 version? I had a feeling that fix might come back to haunt us.\r\n\r\n  Merged, thanks!  Aka #509\r\n\r\n@nolimits4web has your position changed on `backdrop-filter`? @ZanderBrown will probably implement/merge it but as opt-in only because its performance is very poor  Thanks!  Can this be closed  Material or iOS theme? Shouldn't be the cause but the HTML layout differs between the two. Looks like something wrong with HTML content you are trying to pass to methods. Would be good to see live example or more code examples  Can you provide some code please?  Merged, thanks!  Could you share a Gist demonstrating the problem? Does the problem occur with the latest F7? (you said your using 1.4) should work but i would recommend copying the css as well You have wrong HTML layout, all modals (popup, etc.) should be direct children of body of app root element Whoa give us a chance, saying you've had no support is wrong as I responded requesting more information almost immediately \r\n\r\nPlease remember that other than @nolimits4web when he's given donations are completely unpaid for the time we spend maintaining Framework7 and as such can't always give in-depth responses as quick as you might like Pop up and login screen are inside of \"pages\" div as I see in you file, they should be inside of body @J05HI i can't see such bug in kitchen sink. How to replicate it?  Examples help  You can add iNoBounce or similar Well use another then but @nolimits4web has made it clear on many occasions it's not something he plans to include the bounce effect is native to webkit, the engine that displays all web content on iOS.\r\n\r\nTherefore all pages will have it unless it's defeated with techniques like iNoBounce  You comment isn't exactly clear. Is it possible for you to share some code so that we can see what your talking about  Can you provide a CodePen or jsFiddle? So is it confirmed? Excuse me whilst i do things in the future\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17074021/23762441/da2d8b14-04ed-11e7-966d-6e7485208667.png)\r\n Fixed, it fires twice because: first time on checkbox input and second on related smart select's select  do they have unique `data-page` values Due to the behaviour of `page:init` it won't trigger when going back to Services but it running for Contact Us is a bit odd\r\n\r\nCan you share some code? Ah i see know, F7 only keeps the current and previous page. So if the navigation is `Home > About > Services > Contact` then Contact & Services are kept in DOM.\r\n\r\nTo avoid reapplying event listeners F7 doesn't trigger `page:init` everytime the page becomes visible however as going back means About is now the previous page so F7 fetches it and runs `page:init` on it ensuring it's ready should the user go back again\r\n\r\nTL;DR: this is a feature, not a bug  This PR has fundamental issue. As such rerendering will break all components initialized by \"page:init\" and won't detach all assigned events and destroy initialized components, so potentially can lead to memory leaks as well. So it is good for something simple but won't work and break things in case you have something more complex. Also, it won't work on iOS theme if you have some dynamic data in navbar because it is rendered outside of page. So to make it work correctly the page should be destroyed correctly then rerendered and added/replaced by new one and re-initialized. To make it work, it is possible to use view router's method, something like:\r\n```js\r\nfunction renderPage(data) {\r\n    var tpl = Template7.cache[this.url];\r\n    var newData = data || this.data || {};\r\n\r\n    view.router.load({\r\n        template: tpl,\r\n        reload: true,\r\n        reloadPrevious: $(this.container).hasClass('page-on-left'),\r\n        context: newData\r\n    });\r\n}  @J05HI you'll see I've assigned @nolimits4web (he get's the final say) but he's quite busy and probably hasn't had time to look at it yet. @J05HI we do care but we aren't paid to maintain F7 so we can only deal with issues / PR's in our free time. @J05HI while this PR is fixing the issue, in same time it provides different look and feel, which is not so \"material\". Need to think about how to fix it and keep the same look and behavior  you probably need to reinitialize the search bar Yes, as @ZanderBrown stated, searchbar should be reinitialized as well. But it is not recommended to change it on the fly, it is better to reload the page and init app again with rtl styles  How many editors respect `.editorconfig`? Thanks!  @macdonst folks agree :)  That works. @Tarekajaj could you tidy the indentation please? Thanks  Well, for some reason i can not replicate it and it works fine for me. Can anyone confirm there is such issue? \r\ncc @valnub @ZanderBrown  Still works fine for me \ud83d\ude1e Guys, what is your environment? I'm checking at:\r\nhttp://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/\r\nmacOS 10.12.3\r\nChrome OSX 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit) (with both emulating mobile device (android) and not) Followed @valnub 's steps. Can confirm bug on: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3013.3 Safari/537.36`\r\n\r\nMight be something in the daylight saving theory, the UK changes from GMT (+0000) to BST (+0100) on the 26th which is, of course, between the 15th and 30th of March Wow, that is why it works fine for me  Ok, i believe we already fixed it by @Tarekajaj PR  Okay so it would be better to give an explanation of the changes but Google Translate and a review of the changes seem to show that this PR removes some unrequired css.  Care to open a pull request?  Can you give further details about the images in question? @valnub & @nolimits4web any thoughts?  Possible relation to #1337? @kurni correct however they are both about misaligned autocomplete menus  Can you further explain the bug to us @nonenull ? Odd it works fine [here](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/)\r\n\r\nCan we see your HTML please? I can only assume having 2 tab bars with 3 tabs on one page is confusing it  Thanks for PR, but it is a bit wrong way to replace all to passive:false as we still need passive listeners in some places, so i've fixed it in a correct way  Have you initialized the view? According to official Material guidelines center part should follow the left part, not centered  Does the console show anything? Odd I've never had a problem with push state.\r\nHave you got a view with class `view-main` initialised? Navigation controls work fine on that [link](http://slawson.org/kernelpanic/f7/index.html)  Looks good.\r\nJust needs approval from @nolimits4web or @valnub   I think domCache may be the solution  Looks good to me!  I suggest if you wish to use Vue you use the bindings @nolimits4web provides https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Vue @xdadda any response? Well as we haven't seen any of your code that's hard to do. Please check the existing F7-Vue templates and what is new `root` parameter introduced in F7 since 1.5.0 which you should pass as same as your Vue root element. Also, i don't believe it is good idea to use `<body>` in the template and mount Vue app directly to body is also not allowed, use some separate root element like `<div id=\"root\">`  I'm thinking maybe this is a Cordova rather than F7?  The colour of the image is hardcoded in a url encoded data uri.  That's one seriously weird edge case bug that. Good catch @SteffenDE!\r\n  The [HIG](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-views/tables/) is a tad unconclusive I did it near the \"title\" line because it was what we can see in few native iOS apps (like Mail). Also it has some real advantage, because moving it bottom (center) will \"eat\" additional 20px width from \"item-subtitle\" and \"item-text\" elements, and space is what is really expensive on small screens. So i won't change it to center by default. If you need it, just add few custom CSS rules to achieve it, what you already did.  `<a href=\"http://www.google.com\" class=\"link external button button-raised button-fill color-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Demo</a>`  Pushed fix for this, now `onClose` method accepts second `event` argument which is passed only in case it was closed by click:\r\n```js\r\n...\r\nonClose: function (item, event) {\r\n  if (event) {/*closed by click*/}\r\n  else {/*closed by script*/}\r\n}  As @StefansArya said this would be better asked on SO  Have you tried `domCache: true`  Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give. https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp  Should present a better fix for #1349\r\n\r\nQuite simple PR:\r\n* add `autoFocus` boolean parameter\r\n* update kitchen sink with examples\r\n\r\nThe docs will need updating accordingly \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the git history has gone a little weird throwing in a couple of merges I suggest squash and merge for this one Sure i'll take a look @ZanderBrown i've merged it manually to avoid changes in `dist/` files with some additions. Thanks! Thanks, i'll stop trying to bend Git to my will \ud83d\ude04   [JSFiddle demonstrating the bug](https://jsfiddle.net/s2n1p730/3/)\r\n[JSFiddle demonstrating workaround](https://jsfiddle.net/s2n1p730/4/)\r\n\r\nAn 'autofocus' parameter on autocomplete is definitely something worth considering.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime i can offer a workaround:\r\n```javascript\r\n  onOpen(autocomplete) {\r\n    setTimeout(function() {\r\n      $$(autocomplete.page).find(\"input[type=search]\").focus();\r\n    }, 60);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe timeout should allow the animation to complete before input focus 60ms should be a reasonable time for all platforms but feel free to increase it. @seme1, I have opened a PR for this. Just waiting for the ok from @nolimits4web to merge.  Can confirm  Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give. Is the toolbar needed? Works correctly here: https://codepen.io/13b/pen/ZLmNrY @alapanme did the pen i provided resolve your issue? You didn't need the toolbar div or any of the `toolbar-` classes https://jsfiddle.net/dkkpv379/1/  @nolimits4web, @valnub any thoughts? There is no a Mithril version in development i know about. As for React version, here is the one and up-to-date https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-react/  This would be good to have but i wouldn't have a clue where to start.\r\nPerhaps https://polymer-designer.appspot.com/ [(GitHub)](https://github.com/Polymer/designer) could provide some inspiration for any implementation.  1: This is not a forum\r\n\r\nhttp://framework7.io/docs/form-ajax-submit.html\r\n\r\n> ## Send form data on submit\r\n> To enable Ajax form and send data automatically on submit, we just need to add \"ajax-submit\" class to form:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> <form action=\"send-here.html\" method=\"GET\" class=\"ajax-submit\">\r\n>     ...\r\n> </form> \r\n> ```\r\n> And when user will submit this form, it automatically will be sended using Ajax with the following rules:\r\n> \r\n> * Form data will be sended to the file/url specified in form's \"action\" attribute\r\n> * Request method will be the same as specified in form's \"method\" attribute\r\n> * Content type will be the same as specified in form's \"enctype\" attribute. By default (if not specified), it is application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n\r\nIf you wish to post merely set the method as `POST`  I imagine this is related to #1285  That being said as #1285 has been closed with a specific fix having been committed it would be good to keep this open as it's slightly different.\r\n\r\nMy comment was meant to highlight the similarities Give it a go and submit a PR \ud83d\ude04   No Code & No Description.\r\n\r\n@marcosvicente this is not a forum. Try stackoverflow.\r\n\r\n@valnub & @nolimits4web Move to close?  @tinyCoder32 there is something wrong with your layout or in scripts, will be really helpful to see some live app or at least JSFiddle/Codepen with the reproducable issue Move out searchbar from navbar. Put it in navbar-inner or if you need it everywhere move it outside of navbar and put it as the direct child of \"pages\"  In this case the following structure is required and always recommended in Popup:\r\n```\r\n.popup\r\n  .view\r\n    .page\r\n      .page-content\r\n```\r\nTo make all things work correctly. Page-content is required for Autocomplete to work, otherwise it is pretty hard (and heavy) to detect correct position and all scrollable layers  Could you expand?  Whilst this is all very interesting i'm not sure this is really the right place to discuss it.\r\n\r\nAlthough seriously congratulations i can see you have put a LOT of work into this  There is  a forum [here](http://forum.framework7.io/)  http://framework7.io/docs/autocomplete.html See 'Dropdown With All Values'  have you tried adding the active class to the second tab?  Ok now, thanks!  There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted It is default and native iOS app behavior. You should use some Cordova/Phonegap keyboard plugin to configure such behavior, e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-keyboard#keyboardshrinkview  It is not an official package, have no idea who is the author of this package  Actually some Android distros do ship Firefox instead of Chrome so while PhoneGap etc. would render in WebKit online WebApps (inc. those pinned to homescreen) would be rendered in Gecko Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give.

Very weird behavior of `$$.each`  Hi, works for me using Chrome on iOS. Are you on Windows 10? Or maybe ChromeOS? Mouseclicks not working on a touchscreen. Weirdest thing I've ever head of :D  centrual's PR got merged.\r\n\r\n@scriptPilot Did this solve the issue for you?  I guess, this is rather a browser problem than a F7 issue?\r\n\r\nAlso, as Zander said, the whole point of ajax is asynchronousness (guess what the 'a' in ajax stands for :-) )  The PR was merged, so can this issue be closed?  Hi, can you post a running example of the issue on codepen? Yes, I can confirm this as well  You could send in a PR and reference this issue  Well, Dom7 offers just a very small subset of jQuery, so if you want all of jQuery's features, you have to import jQuery which should be no problem. ok, the fix was rather simple, I just added another for loop, see https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/1307  Yes, don't just doubleclick the html file as it will serve your app via `file:///`. Instead, you have to use `http`  Yes, white theme does not work in Material Design. See duplicate here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/1103  @blackholegalaxy Does this fix the issue for you? Can it be closed?  Hi, the settings name `domCache` might be missleading. From what I understand, enabling it will only activate the ability to embed pages into the DOM without using Ajax Pages feature. It has nothing to do with caching pages, I think. I don't think this is a bug. As far as I know, F7 currently only supports using either Ajax pages _or_ cached pages, not both at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis might rather be a feature request.  Why not open a PR? :-) https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/  Hi, can you post a working example on Codepen? Thanks > I was tried with check the body'class in pageBack events, if the body have class .with-panel-left-cover, close the panel and it's work.\r\n> But my problem, the page also turn back to previous page.\r\n\r\nDid you try `event.preventDefault()` ? Oh, I see you mean the back button of the Android device. I thought you might be able to put that code into the click event listener of Framework7's back button.\r\n\r\nHm, to be honest I don't know how to do this. You'll probably have to mess around with `popstate` event.  Added `highlightMatches` option which is enabled by default  Do you have live example? Looks like something wrong with messages layout HTML as i can't really replicate it  Sorry i'm not quite understanding, do you mean the previous page is still in DOM?  Hi, I tested on Safari for Mac on https://jsfiddle.net/4mejdojk/2/ and it works fine for me. Are you sure that the problem still exists? Sorry, I still cannot reproduce the issue on Safari 10.0.2 No matter what i do i simply can't reproduce this.\r\n\r\n@nolimits4web, @macdonst you had any luck reproducing this?  What do you mean by \"support Dom7\"? It is already supported. If in your example, you will pas HTMLElement as listBlock parameter nothing will work at all Unexplained, has conflicts and no response has been given.  I think it's in the hand of devs to pick the right font-size for these icons. How is F7 supposed to know the right font size?  Merged, thanks!  Because in this case your query is part of the location hash not of the query. You can use `$$.parseUrlQuery('http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/views/car-choice.html?loaddingMore=0'.split('#')[1])` in such case  It should be:\r\n```js\r\nvar xhr = $$.ajax(...);\r\nxhr.addEventListener('progress', progress, false);  I'm not sure this is directly related to F7. @DetectiveW could you please elaborate? F7 isn't designed to work with any particular server side environment, can you not define a custom method or add the control by hand? If you're having problems using ASP.NET to generate your F7 site why use it? Why not use static files or PHP?  Well, it does make sense because pages do not trigger these events  Have you code a codepen / jsfiddle handy?  Update F7 to latest 1.5 version  I believe this is a misunderstanding of the router.\r\n\r\nAs a future note it can often be better to submit issues in your native language, that way you can confidently add details and leave us to use Google Translate or our own Multilingual skills to read it   I'm going to say this is massively out of scope. However plugins/PRs are welcome.  Not at the moment. Would be great to see plugin from you ;)  Guys, do you still have issues with assets on website?  Fixed in https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/467e860ed6499c30d4d65caa6b49c812dc5f92aa  Merged, thanks!  call `sizeNavbars` method after you change its content http://framework7.io/docs/navbar.html#related-app-and-view-methods  As it's intermittent and only occurring in Safari i'm thinking it's a WebKit bug  Thanks, fixed!  It would be good to see your HTML as well as your JavaScript  Thanks! Merged manually as dist files shouldn't be changed  Merged, thanks!  Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give.  This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [ ] bug\r\n* [x] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCan we have something like this? https://marcosmoura.github.io/vue-material/#/components/table\r\nMulti-column sort feature would be really nifty.\r\n\r\n![tablet view](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3787662/20319104/2fdb6ca0-ab6d-11e6-9556-f4953d845a43.jpg)\r\n Unless you know something i don't this isn't underdevelopment, only being discussed Speaking of which it would be good to get @nolimits4web 's perspective Added by commit 45004e1cdf2ddfd739e249412d5b79c45fcdf9bd See #1439   I'm not sure is complies with the iOS HIG.  There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted  I am unable to reproduce this issue http://framework7.io/docs-demos/tabs-swipeable.html  It's not pretty but you could use `router.back(); router.back();`\r\nBut it's normal for all pages to appear in history.\r\n\r\nMaybe you need to rethink your app hierarchy   Could you please provide some more detail? Some code?  Use correct View->pages->Page inside to have this callbacks\n  Not easy to handle this case automatically, just increase `top` position to this searchbar and increase `padding-top` on page-content for this page\n  This question is far more outside of this repo\n  Because in this case router will load page using Ajax from index file and it is empty. Enable domCache or load its Ajax content once again when you get back to it\n  Template7 doesn't have data bindings\n  Merged, thanks\n  You should have full View HTML structure there with `.views > .pages > .page > ....` to have this event\n  Merged manually! Thanks!  The problem with this fix is that it will be broke thumbnail and range-fill on Safari (which is actually the target for iOS theme) where it works fine This good to merge now?  @bencompton I will start to work on Vue.js integration/fork first. React integration won't be soon. So, of course, feel free to start your fork/integration and I can join to your project later\n Something is already happening here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Vue :)\n @seme1 no, no weex here\n Here is a small sneak peek of F7 Vue plugin and things I already successfully achieved:\n- Almost all F7 components are wrapped into Vue components which saves a lot of markup and also allows to differentiate some iOS/Material difference in layout automatically within components\n- And I finally implemented a bit different router that allows to load Vue components as pages. This was the hardest task. For this I added to native F7 router ability to pass page HTMElelement which is added to Dom and rendered by Vue and F7's router just do the animation stuff with further required pages callbacks and pages initialization. I believe same logic can be reused in React implementation \n- I also added a fix to F7 that allows to use same page structure with navbar inside of page, and it automatically moves it out of page and put to correct place if you use dynamicNavbar\n- Added Auto initialisation for F7, Views and some components configurable via properties so it's zero JS required for basic start\n @farskid The Vue plugin is actually production ready afaik, see:\r\n\r\n- http://framework7.io/vue (Offical page)\r\n- https://wp.me/p6WYcX-Vv (Getting started tutorial by me) @bencompton Did you try these TypeScript definitions for F7? https://github.com/JasonKleban/Framework7.d.ts @bencompton No problem, don't know how up-to-date these are tho I think we can close it as @bencompton have already created awesome https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-react :)  It works, just try to change Kitchen Sink's code at https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/kitchen-sink-ios/js/kitchen-sink.js#L604-L607\n\nfrom\n\n```\n                onChange: function (picker, country) {\n                    if(picker.cols[1].replaceValues){\n                        picker.cols[1].replaceValues(carVendors[country]);\n                    }\n                }\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n                onChange: function (picker, country) {\n                    if(picker.cols[1].replaceValues){\n                        setTimeout(function () {\n                            picker.cols[1].replaceValues(carVendors[country]);\n                        }, 1000);\n                    }\n                }\n```\n\nAnd to be honest i don't see reason why it may not work in setTimeout or Ajax call, so look for the issue in your code\n  @iHackify looks like you overwritten default style:\n\n```\n.subnavbar > .buttons-row {\n    width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nadd it back or set `margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;` for this buttons-row style\n  @J05HI unfortunately this PR has merge conflicts. Care to resolve them?   Hi, actually there is actually a check for href attribute inside, and i can't really replicate this issue and see any exceptions. How to replicate the issue to see it?\n  @iHackify problem doesn't related to Ajax pages. You can check default Kitchen Sink demo which uses Ajax pages and there is everything fine, so double check layout of all pages is correct and your console errors. Otherwise would be good to see live example or something with the issue can be observed\n Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give.

There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted  What stops you do an Ajax request and call popup?\n\n```\n$$.get('somefile.html', function (content){\n  myApp.popup(content);\n})\n```\n\n`somefile.html` suppose you have the correct Popup's HTML structure\n  @arvi you are right, fixed. But this is issue not for F7 it is for website\n  Thanks\n  @lixinchuang don't use native JS `alert`, use `myApp.alert` instead. Native alerts break JS execution context which conflicts with fast click and you get double click instead\n @lixinchuang you can disable fast click for this button by adding `no-fastclick` to it\n  Looks good, thanks!\n  @phuongtailtranminh make sure you have specified correct CSP in meta tag in the index.html file http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/ . Also do the search for CSP on ftamework7 forum, there were a lot of discussions there about it\n  This happens because this is how JS works, if there is an error it breaks context. I can't check for existing of all variables in T7 before rendering because it could really slow down rendering/parsing performance. Just wrap such cases with custom `if` statements in templates:\n\n```\n<li><b>Air</b> - {{#if features}}{{features.air}}{{/if}}</li>\n```\n  @nimo23 this is because these events has same name, use it like:\n\n``` js\n$$('.picker-modal').on('open', '.picker-modal', function (e) {\n    if ($(e.target).hasClass('picker-modal')) {\n        // Event generated by picker only, not by something else inside\n        console.log('picker opened');\n    }\n}, false);\n```\n\nsame for close event\n  @valnub is right. There is no such implementation because there are no such things in iOS or material specifications. Another heavy reason is that it will be totally useless on iOS as it will conflict with native control center (swipe from the bottom) and notifications center (swipe from the top), so it won't work anyway.  There are also no such features as (I believe) developers and good apps must deliver good user experience, so if user opens iOS app he should know and aware and use common gestures and control elements he get used to. Such things may confuse users. \n\nAnd actually if you need something swipe from up or down you can easily use popup, just add some custom class and specify required height for it (like half height of the screen) and you'll get what you want\n  No, everything is correct in documentation. Toolbar in material theme is on the top (below navbar) by default\n  @tinwhisker it's not my issue! This issue belongs to @hessius & @peterel \r\n\r\nHowever thanks for diagnosing the issue.\r\n\r\nSo @nolimits4web it would appear the behaviour of `.virtualList` is different to different to that shown in the docs (http://framework7.io/docs/virtual-list.html) specifically:\r\n\r\n> ## Initialize Virtual List\r\n> Now, when we have list's HTML, we need to initialize it. We need to use required App method:\r\n> ```javascript\r\n> myApp.virtualList(listBlockContainer, parameters) - initialize virtual list with parameters\r\n> * listBlockContainer - HTMLElement or string (with CSS Selector) of \"list-block\" HTML element. Required.\r\n> * parameters - object - object with virtual list parameters. Required.\r\n> ```\r\n> Method returns initialized Virtual List instance\r\n> For example:\r\n> ```javascript\r\n> var myList = app.virtualList('.list-block', {\r\n>     items: [1,2,3,4],\r\n>     height: 44\r\n> });\r\n> ```\r\n> > Note that Virtual List container (listBlockContainer) should be in DOM on a moment of initialization. \r\n> > So if you use virtual list not on home page, you need to initialize it within page:init (or page:beforeinit) event\r\n\r\nSo as far as i can see we have two options:\r\n* Update the docs\r\n* Update the default behaviour\r\n\r\nAnd to finally solve @peterel & @hessius's original issue:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar myList = myApp.virtualList('.list-block', {\r\n    items: [1, 2, 3, 4],\r\n    template: '<li class=\"item-content\"><div class=\"item-inner\"><div class=\"item-title\">{{this}}</div></div></li>'\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAllows use of the expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nPerhaps `<li class=\"item-content\"><div class=\"item-inner\"><div class=\"item-title\">{{this}}</div></div></li>` should be the default value of `template`?  Put\r\n```javascript\r\nclickElem = function (e) {\r\n    console.log('elem clicked');\r\n    var classes = $$(this).attr('class').split(' ');\r\n    var id = classes[1];\r\n    console.log(id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\noutside the `page:init` handler\r\n\r\nAlso what is that click handler attempting to do / why? ```js\r\nfunction clickElem (e) {\r\n    console.log('elem clicked');\r\n    var classes = $$(this).attr('class').split(' ');\r\n    var id = classes[1];\r\n    console.log(id);\r\n}\r\n\r\nmyApp.onPageInit('*', function (page) {\r\n    $$(page.container).off('click', clickElem);\r\n    $$(page.container).on('click', clickElem);\r\n});\r\n``` because to javascript it's not the same function because the function would be redeclared in each call of page:init it's a bit more complicated than that. I'll try to draw some graphs  I didn't get the issue. What should be added, what is `flex-layout`? Layout grid in F7 already uses flex\n  Don't mess layout and theme, There is no layout-white in Material theme as it is white by default. As for white theme, use additional class to set text/icon color:\n\n```\n<div class=\"navbar theme-white color-pink\">\n  ...\n    <i class=\"icon icon-back color-pink\"></i>\n```\n  There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted @heshan-nibaya noted in our internal todo list.  @scriptPilot this is because you may have more than one \".page-content\" in the DOM. Make you selector more specific like `$$('.page[data-page=\"some-page\"] .page-content').on('scroll', ...`\n  Merged, thanks\n  This is why domCache parameter for, it saves previous page without removing them\n  #1080 was resolved as incorrect usage, thus this is superfluous   Hm, yes I can confirm the problem.\r\n\r\nMaybe this helps? https://framework7.io/docs/status-bar.html\r\n\r\nDid you try this?\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"statusbar-overlay\"></div>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n.statusbar-overlay {\r\n    background: transparent;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, you might wanna try this: https://muut.com/framework7#!/framework7/bugs-and-issues:status-barlogin-screen-iss\r\n\r\n`<meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black-translucent\">`  Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give. There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted  Related to #910  Closing as no further discussion \n  Merged, thanks\n  Merged, thanks\n  @vyarmak could you explain further and clear up the merge conflicts please? @akikochuchu ?  @vyarmak did you create a PR? Can this be closed?  It is just switching tabs, router doesn't work here at all. You may need to use Tabs' show/hide events\n  This seems to be resolved  Can @nolimits4web, @macdonst or anyone else investigate this?\r\n\r\nCould @jascolley provide a CodePen / jsFiddle reproducing the issue?  This was never fully explain and appears to be resolved  Thanks! Ok, now it looks like it is everything ok in same stable branch versionThanks! Ok, now it looks like it is everything ok in same stable branch version\n  Are you using the markup as [shown here](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/bars-sub-navbar.html)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div data-page=\"sub-navbar\" class=\"page\">\r\n    <div class=\"navbar\">\r\n        <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\r\n            <div class=\"left\">\r\n                <a href=\"index.html\" class=\"back link icon-only\">\r\n                    <i class=\"icon icon-back\"></i>\r\n                </a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"center\">Sub Navbar</div>\r\n                <div class=\"right\">\r\n                    <a href=\"#\" class=\"open-panel link icon-only\">\r\n                        <i class=\"icon icon-bars\"></i>\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"subnavbar\">\r\n                <div class=\"buttons-row\">\r\n                    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button active\">Link 1</a>\r\n                    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button\">Link 2</a>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"page-content with-subnavbar hide-bars-on-scroll\">\r\n            <div class=\"content-block\">\r\n                ....\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the most important thing to note here is the `with-subnavbar` class on `.page-content` something @applecat 's code lacks  The callback was called at page initialization on app load/init because this page already in was in DOM. Just hook to `pageReinit` event instead here\n  This is out of F7's scope  I know about that effect, but about performance, as i remember from tests it transitions became pretty slow with this\n @liuxinqiang any chance you can cleanup the merge conflicts?  Could you please share a CodePen or jsFiddle so we can reproduce this?  The correct event to listen for is `form:success`  Template7 would be more appropriate i belive  Merged, thanks!\n  Is your Framework7 instance stored in `myApp` or `app`?  I'm pretty sure this is a donejs bug rather than F7  @7h3m4dS0u1 could you open a PR perhaps?  @nolimits4web what do you think? @ZanderBrown I think it can be useful, will add it to roadmap  It depends on your server-side routing, not related to F7\n  Can you provide examples?\r\n\r\nThis is quite a big request  Cool, thanks! Meged\n  Could you provide a screenshot and working demonstration please?  Could you elaborate please?  Are you creating the list within page:init?  Can you provide a working demonstration of the issue?  Does this still happen? Is anything shown in the console?  Sorry for late review. Merged, thanks\n  Congratulations on being the 1000th issue.\r\n\r\nWould i be right in thinking this issue can be closed?  `line-height` DOES work on Android, can't see such issue. Make sure you test it on Android 4.4+\n Screenshot?\n And related HTML?\n  Check the forum http://forum.framework7.io/#!/?backbutton there are plenty solutions for this\n  Thanks! Merged\n  There are rough road maps on Patreon and other F7 related sites.  > but on close (BACK) of top-most popup closes all popups\n\n@murliatdure from the docs http://framework7.io/docs/popup.html#open-and-close-popup\n\n> To close popup we need to add \"close-popup\" class to any HTML element (prefered to link)\n> \n> If you have more than one popups in app, you need to specify appropriate popup via additional data-popup=\".my-popup\" attribute on this HTML element\n\nJust specify required popup to close in back/close button `<a class=\"close-popup\" data-popup=\".my-popup\">Close</a>`\n  @plashenkov is this still an issue? Could you open a pull request? Fixed by #1410  This is a normal Cordova/Phonegap app behavior, just disable it by adding `<preference name=\"DisallowOverscroll\" value=\"true\" />` in your config.xml\n  @MarioVanDenEijnde could you provide some more details?  Preview iOS theme in Safari, it may not work correctly in Chrome or other browser\n  It is native input element https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.datetime-local.html\n  ``` js\nvar query = $$.parseUrlQuery(url)\n```\n  @ionas it is the issue with F7, not with docs :) I'll check and fix it\n  @SniperGER unfortunately you have merge conflicts\r\n\r\nCould you explain further? Add some usage snippets?\r\n  Very nice but it's outside the scope of F7  Works fine for me.

As I see, it happens because with `json` request \"success\" callback wrapped with `try/catch` statement. Will see how to fix this\n  You're misinterpreting the functions purpose  Is this issue still actual as i can not replicate it? Works fine for me Could you provide some details and a codepen / jsfiddle please? If you've got a fix please open a PR \ud83d\ude04   Have a look at Tempate7 Contexts  It already has 'pause' feature for native <video> element. But in iframes, it depends on developer needs and used service. You can replace HTML of current slide or just replace URL of iframe using callback parameters. Or if you use YouTube and YouTune API you can just pause them within callbacks\n  It will be rendered correctly no matter of what is in the left or right elements. Just make sure it was added before page init, otherwise just call `sizeNavbar` method http://framework7.io/docs/navbar.html#related-app-and-view-methods\n  What does `template` contain in your case?\n Still not clear, if it is your custom object `template` and it has property `data` then look on your side, otherwise need to see more related code\n  \u041d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c\n  @nolimits4web can you have a look at this?  @czb is this still an issue?

I suggest you make use of the 'Preview' tab in future\r\n\r\nIs this still an issue? @nolimits4web is this correct usage?  This looks like it might be good Thanks @valnub hadn't noticed the conflict. @steadweb could you resolve the conflicts please? It is not needed as form:fromdata already triggers `change` event on inputs  @vestaxpdx as @tobya suggested could you open a PR?  The Windows Mobile market maybe small for phones but there is a quite sizable Windows Tablet market.\r\n\r\nI'm going to keep this open as a possible feature for 2.0  @LeoRodz could you please fix the conflicts and explain why / what you have done here? Okay makes sense but could you update the PR as it currently has conflicts  Is this issue resolved?\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't worry about language it's easier for us to translate a detailed description in language 'x' to our respective languages than try to understand broken English that doesn't describe the problem  Fixed now:\n\n``` js\npreroute: function (view, options) {\n    if (options.isBack) {  ... caused by router.back, don't do preroute if you don't need it ... }\n    else { ... caused by router.load, do preroute if you need it ... {\n}\n```\n  And where is the bug?\n @ijry check #923\n  Would be good to see full HTML layout of the app, views and navbars\n @J05HI could you please include reasons with close requests?  Would be good to see something more descriptive, at least with screenshots\n  It is default iOS effect which is excpected by iOS users, not sure it can be disabled easily. Actually can't see any problems with it. Just make page background color same white as list bg color\n  Would be good how to replicate it more detailed, even better live example\n  Just put a div with required size and image in the page and make navbar transparent. There were few solutions of F7 forum for that\n  Yes, at the moment you have to update item-after manually if you change select value programmatically. For example $('.item-after').text('sometext');\n  Just add \"display:none\" to hidden view by default, and then hide login view and show after login view. You can use something like:\n\n```\n$('.view-main').show();\n$('.another-view').hide();\n```\n\netc\n  There is no native support for Meteor, but i see many people use it with it. Looks like issue somewhere on meteor side or in order of loading styles and scripts\n  Just add \"active\" class to required tab on page load. Currently active tab won't save by default if you close the page. You should do it manually, by saving it for example in local storage or somewhere else\n  If it is actual, what are you trying to achieve with this?\n @nolimits4web this could have some use cases  Ok, i guess we can close it. Reopen if it is still actual and how to replicate it\n  Without using an emulated device resolution lower than any phone available i cannot reproduce this.\r\nThis issue has now been dormant for 10 months.  No response and this seems to be a misinterpretation of the docs  Misinterpretation of docs  Does this issue still occur?  I believe a recent commit from @nolimits4web should have resolved this  @coorasse \"center\" element on Material theme should stick to the left side\n https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/structure.html\n  Closing as no further response, considered as solved\n  @LeoRodz is this now resolved?  Not possible to disable it. As an option, you can try to redefine Dom7's `remove` method:\n\n``` js\nDom7.fn.remove = function () {\n    //do your stuff here\n}\n```\n  No, there is no such in F7, add it manually\n No, it is not a common style\n  Would be good to see actual server response\n Closing as no further response\n  `<div><span/><a/></div>` - it is not a valid HTML. Dom7 doesn't intended for XML parsing. There are vanilla JS tools for parsing XML https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Parsing_and_serializing_XML\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\nnew DOMParser().parseFromString('<div><span/><a/></div>', 'text/xml');\n```\n  Something like:\n\n``` js\n$$(document).on('pageInit', '.smart-select-page', function(e) {\n    $$(e.detail.page.navbarInnerContainer).addClass('someclass')\n})\n```\n  Screenshot doesn't tell much. Live example with the issue would be good\n Closing as no further response, considered as solved\n  It was discussed many times here and on forum. Try to use search. But you can't use router methods within pageInit callback as router is still routing in this case. You need to use `preroute` or `preprocess`\n  Nested modals are not supported, you have to close one before opening another\n Closing as no further response, considered as solved\n  You can disable it later using `myApp.params.swipePanel = false` and for example `myApp.params.swipePanel = 'left'` to enable it again\n  It is done because form elements are require additional styles so additional `inputs-list` class is added to such list-block. Also, try to avoid using different list items (form elements and usual items) in same list, not a good practise. To fix this you can just add `style=\"display:flex\"` to `<div class=\"item-inner\">` of usual item\n  `e.stopPropagation`\n  No, picker modal is not intended to be used like this, so by default it is not implemented. But you can add some kind of such snippet:\n\n``` js\n$$('html').on('click', function (e) {\n    if ($$(e.target).is('.picker-modal') || $$(e.target).parents('.picker-modal').length > 0) {\n        myApp.closeModal('.picker-modal');\n    }\n});\n```\n  It is not supported at the moment in Framework7 and it doesn't work in Phonegap/Cordova app.\n I think this is out of scope and relies on non standard tech.  But in this case you can just specify CSS selector of picker element in DOM to open it. No?\n Then just append it to BODY with unique selector/id and pass it to `pickerModal` method. I will add this feature, but it will do the same\n  Hmm, interesting. Can you guide me a bit how to replicate the issue?\n @lbaker2 could you please address @nolimits4web 's request and clear up the merge conflicts please?  If you use something custom to load pages via ajax and for routing, then you have to use own pushState logic, not the default ones\n  http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/getting-started:how-can-i-get-element-from\n  Ok, played a bit with it. Find the pretty weird behavior, or didn't know it works like that. When we append styleshets in `my-app.js` browser loads them asynchronously, but if we load it in another file or directly in HTML before `my-app.js` it loads them synchronously. So part with stylesheets should be removed from my-app.js and order should be the following:\n\n``` html\n<body>\n    ...\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/framework7.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      (function () {\n        if (Framework7.prototype.device.android) {\n              Dom7('head').append(\n                  '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/framework7.material.min.css\">' +\n                  '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/framework7.material.colors.min.css\">' +\n                  '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/my-app.material.css\">'\n              );\n          }\n          else {\n              Dom7('head').append(\n                  '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/framework7.ios.min.css\">' +\n                  '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/framework7.ios.colors.min.css\">' +\n                  '<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/my-app.ios.css\">'\n              );\n          }\n      })();\n    </script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"my-app.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\n I will update tutorial with this snippet\n Yes, should be anywhere but before my-app.js. To be honest i don't really understand why browser does like that :)\n  Yes, it is not accessible. Will add such option to VL\n  Where do you see such issue and on which device? I can't replicate it\n Could you please expand you point?\r\nConsider pointing code snippets here, on [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).\r\nMake sure you have read the [documentation](http://framework7.io/docs/) correctly and followed any instructions it may give. There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted @nolimits4web any thoughts?  So i guess the problem is solved. Reopen if you still have this issue\n  It can't not work. It means you are attaching it to a wrong element or in a wrong moment (when it is not in DOM)\n If you use default F7' styled checkboxes/radio, the input element itself is hidden there, it is impossible to use `mouseover` event on it because it is hidden. Attach this event to input's visible parent element\n There is no tooltips in F7, should be implemented manually. Don't think that popover is a good fit for this\n  Merged, thanks\n  It is the issue of Kitchen Sink only, look for correct code at https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/kitchen-sink-ios/js/kitchen-sink.js#L1056-L1083\n  Smart select is a wrap around HTML's `<select>` element which has the same behavior, it can't be with _no item selected by default_\n  This is default iOS browser behavior, Ionic uses custom JS scroll vs native scroll in F7, so no chances to get it fixed here. In cordova app it is configurable via, for example, `DisallowOverscroll` property in `config.xml`\n  In this case you have to init lazy script manually using, for example: `app.initImagesLazyLoad('.page');`\n  There is no `deferred` objects/methods in Dom7 ajax, you need to use callbacks as a parameters or Ajax events or manual/custom promises (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\n  Just try to tweak required styles for this page. Probably you need to remove paddings on page-content\n  There is no plans at the moment to support these. Check the #758 \n  There is no default icon set, except back/bars icons. You can easily use the specified icons by just including required styles\n  I can only recommend you to use Virtual List here to keep the required amount of DOM in the list\n  Would be good to see what you have tried and how it is not doing anything\n  Can you show what have you tried?\n Swipeable tabs are just basically the Swiper. So you have to options:\n1) Use Swiper's `onSlideChnageStart` callback to detect active slide and using `$$('.toolbar-inner').scrollLeft(position, duration)` method to scroll tab links to required position\n2) You can just use 2 swipers (one for tabs itself and another one for tab links where each slide is a link) using Swiper's controller feature like in example here http://www.idangero.us/swiper/demos/23-thumbs-gallery.html\n  Sounds weird. Does it happen on real device or simulator, and what is iOS version?\n Don't know what to suggest, i can't replicate it :) What i can suggest is try to add `translate3d(0,0,0)` to that scale transform property for its pseudo elements, also try to add `-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden` CSS property to checkbox and its pseudo elements. Potentially this could help\n  Can you explain a bit more detailed about what you are trying to achieve with this? Probably there is another way of fixing this\n Ok, the issue isn't related to Framework7, looks like the issue somewhere in integration with Ionic. You can try to call stopPropagation after PB is opened like:\n\n```\n$('.photo-browser-close-link').on('click', function(e){\n    e.stopPropagation();\n})\n```\n\nThere is no `event` argument in `.close` method because in Framework7 this method is not really attached to click on that link, such structure with close link click is just one of the many use cases in F7\n  You can see solution on forum here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/getting-started:cancel-ajax-form-submission\n I guess you are the same person, we can consider it resolved then :)\n  You can check View's `.history` property. It is an array with pages/URL which you can modify. To jump back any specific page you can use router's `.back()` method with `force:true` parameter, e.g. `mainView.router.back({url: 'another-page.html', force: true})`\n\nBut if you use `pushState` you can't modify browser's history in such way, so it won't work properly with it\n It depends on your app and layout/UI/UX just make sure that your logic/behavior should be clear and expected from user\n  F7 is not a Whatsapp replica, it is not so complex feature to realize manually, just look at `position: sticky` CSS property or numerous JS \"sticky\" libraries and plugins\n  Looks like you are doing something wrong, as you may see it is fine in default Kitchen Sink demo. Would be good to see live example\n Closing due to inactivity \n  Don't know what happens. Probably conflict with FastClick lib, you can try to add \"no-fastclick\" class to such elements\n  Thanks, fixed\n  > then I test an animation js tool - Velocity.js\n\nDid you test exact same animations with same styles in F7 on Android with CSS3 vs Velocity, or you just think so? :D I will check it, but i recommend you to use Crosswalk for Android\n I think the current CSS animations are perfectly smooth enough and @zhengnz never replied with any statistics  No, it is not supported by iOS theme. But apparently you can just copy styles from material theme for floating button to your app's css to have same visuals\n  Would be good to see what have you tried and what is wrong with it, maybe live example or video or at least screenshots?\n Closing due to inactivity \n  Just add this to your CSS:\n\n``` css\n.views {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n```\n  No, there will be new/additional type of router later which will support routing for anything\n  You can look at #702 but as far as i know it is not really possible\n  Discussed many times. These OSes have pretty different structure and many things are just impossible to do with same HTML layout. Nothing painless, all you need is to just move navbar to page. Otherwise you may use \"Fixed\" navbar for iOS as well and have totally same layout\n  Sorry, it is a mobile-first framework. There is no such things on mobiles :smile: \n @nolimits4web do you plan on adding this?  This is how it should work. `reload` replace last page in history with the new one. Just don't use reload if you need to load new page in history\n Can't say without live example or code example on how do you load them\n This is because these pages have same URL and F7 doesn't allow to load same URL pages by default. So you can add some query to url of such pages or just enable `allowDuplicateUrls: true` parameter in app or view settings when you init it\n  Just put floating button on the same level in DOM as your Navbar, like in kitchen sink demo\n  Can't replicate it. Do you see such issue on kitchen sink demo and does it happen on real device?\n then something is wrong. Would be good to see live example then\n You have initialized F7 twice! You shouldn't do it:\n\n``` js\n// Initialize your app\nvar myApp = new Framework7();\n\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    swipePanel: 'left',\n});\n```\n  There is no in plans to add custom page transition by default as it will lead to misuse with worse native-like look & feel. But they are pure CSS based, so people who know and sure they need it, can change it. It is just:\n\n``` css\n.page-from-right-to-center {\n   animation: custom-animation1 ...\n}\n.page-from-center-to-right {\n   animation: custom-animation2 ...\n}\n.page-from-center-to-left {\n   animation: custom-animation3 ...\n}\n.page-from-left-to-center {\n   animation: custom-animation4 ...\n}\n```\n  You are probably doing something wrong. It works, otherwise none of clicks will work at all\n No, but it works in Cordova/Phonegap and in browser. Phonegap Build doesn't use something else\n Would be good to see live example of this issue\n Looks like specific Android/device issue because dataset is supported http://caniuse.com/#search=dataset. Anyway, you shouldn't use `numeric` properties like `data-1` etc. From what i see it works fine with string values. Otherwise just use Crosswalk to use edge webview with correct support\n  Yes, it was removed as you can use other atomic templates for its different parts. Will remove it from docs\n  > I've tried using app.mainView.router.back({ url: 'home.html', force: true }) but that only pops one page off the history stack\n\nThen url passed here is wrong. Use it like:\n\n``` js\napp.mainView.router.back({ url: app.mainView.history[0], force: true })\n\n```\n  Merged, thanks\n  Window is not scrolling in Framework7, it is `page-content`, so you need to change in this lib to listen scrolling on that div instead of window or maybe it has such option/parameter\n  Sorry, but not possible as such layout uses multiple list blocks. You can use VL for each of UL or use single list with VL but with List Divider http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/list-view.html#list-divider instead grouped lists\n  Android version? Do you have same issue in Kitchen Sink demo on website for Material theme?\n Ok, see that. Will check it\n  You need to enable `pushState` if you want to have different URLs\n  Would be good to see live example with the issue, especially with iframe case\n As for contenteditable just add `no-fastclick` class to that container\n  What exactly `unexpected behaviour` do you mean?\n Closing due to inactivity \n  Sorry, don't know what is wechat browser. On Android it is only Chrome and default browser (4.4+) are supported\n  ``` js\nvar modal = myApp.modal({\n  title: 'Prompt',\n  text: 'Enter some text',\n});\n\n$$(modal).find('input[type=\"text\"]').val('some preset prompt value');\n```\n  Not really possible to unify it as many may want custom type of such information (list, block, text, etc...) \nJust do manually something like :\n\n``` js\nif (myListData.length === 0) $('.virtual-list').html('nothing here');\n```\n  It is because swiper is invisible when you initialize it. Call swiper's `.update()` method when your popup with swiper becomes visible\n  Hard to say as i'm not a require.js pro. Did you look at require demo app?\n Then it would be good to see live example, it is hard to understand where is the issue without it\n The link is private, can't access to it\n That means the problem somewhere in knockout-part, sorry i'm not familiar with it so won't be able to help much with it\n  But it is easy to do with few lines of custom CSS\n Fixed by #1230  It is not allowed to do like that. You are trying to insert another HTML document in current document. Use iframes instead\n  This looks interesting. But why, if there is a https://github.com/boynet/Framework7-Indexed-List-plugin plugin already exist. I just didn't want to move it to F7's core because it is pretty rarely used. Maybe there is a more sense to PR it to https://github.com/boynet/Framework7-Indexed-List-plugin plugin?\n  Hi, thanks for PR but i didn't really get the issue. Can you provide some example or how to replicate it?\n  Won't work because i guess you have loaded it like `a(href=\"somepage.html\", data-context-name=\"somecontext\")` To reload it you need to use full router API like:\n\n```\nmainView.router.load({\n    url: 'somepage.html',\n    reload: true,\n    context: somecontext\n});\n```\n\n> By the way, there is no Templates global variable as documented in the doc.\n\nThere is no such in docs. It is `Template7.templates` or `app.templates`\n Ok, it is issue in docs, should be `Template7.data`\n Fixed in docs\n  Looks like issue on your side. Please provide some example\n  This seems to be resolved.  Can't replicate it. Would be good to know Android version and browser type/version\n  Closing due to inactivity \n  @ZanderBrown Yeah, but Vladi knows F7 core rendering functionality better than me, so he'll have to decide if this gets merged. @J05HI you will notice that there are merge conflicts, hence the red label @J05HI PR still has merge conflicts that @antono hasn't resolved Okay closing in favour of #1391  Just use custom modal http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/modal.html#custom-modals\n  Thx, fixed in dev\n  Sorry, didn't understand, what is the issue?\n Still not clear what do you mean. Back button in navbar is the same link, so the same `<a href=\"#index\" class=\"back\"> Go back to home page </a>`. You can also add force to skip pages in between `<a href=\"#index\" class=\"back\" data-force=\"true\"> Go back to home page </a>`\n There is no something special about that for Inline Pages. It depends on what type of layout do you use for this View: Fixed, Static, Through or Through with Dynamic Navbar. All this is well described at http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar-toolbar-layouts.html No?\n Really hard to say without looking at live example or code snippets. But it is definitely something wrong with layout\n There is no difference what type of page you are loading. If you use dunamicNavbar then each page MUST have its  own navbar\n Is it still actual?\n  Router's back method with `force:true`:\n\n```\nview.router.back({\n  url: 'homeurl.html', // - in case you use Ajax pages\n  pageName: 'homepage_name', // - in case you use Inline Pages or domCache\n  force: true\n});\n```\n\nPlease use Forum for questions\n  If you use Inline Pages then the active page the one which doesn't have \"cached\" classes. For other types of navigation it is not really allowed to multiple pages at the app start into single View\n One page per view. If you need more pages (for some reason) then look at Inline Pages\n  No, toolbar-through will stay the same for all pages, it doesn't updated for pages like navbar.\n Don't mess Tab Bar app layout and Toolbar through-type. Toolbar's Through type layout is just about styling and visuals, in this case toolbar will be always visible and stays the same. If you want to show different toolbar for specific page, use fixed toolbar in that page and hide main tab bar toolbar \n You can see how it is done in Kitchen Sink toolbars examples \n It is available online here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/\nNavbar & Toolbars -> Tab Bar you can see it hides main toolbar for this page\n Yes, you also need to add extra style/class to this page's toolbar to keep it visible with `no-toolbar` class\n <img width=\"352\" alt=\"s\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/11405602/cfd542f2-93b9-11e5-8f52-9e412353d6a1.png\">\n > When would you suggest using views instead of inline pages?\n\nViews and Pages are different substances and not really replaceable. Please use Forum for questions in future\n  Are you sure you are using latest version?\n Can't see such issue. Where do you see this?\n Exactly, i can't see it, it works fine. At least in latest Chrome\n You can try to set `myApp.rtl = true` and `$('html').attr('dir', 'rtl')` after you add it. But i would just recommend you to add RTL CSS before the app init\n  There is a Swiper for that. Duplicate of #542\n  Why? Can't see such issue\n  This is because toolbar in Material theme is on top, not on the bottom\n  It is mobile-only framework, and it supports 2-sizes: phone and tablet. You can do column like:\n\n```\n<div class=\"col-50 tablet-10\">...</div>\n```\n\nIt is explained in documentation http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/grid.html\n  What kind of docs are you looking for it? It is just an image, so place it and style it like you want\n  From 4.0, better from 4.4+\n  It will be broken because Swiper became hidden. You need to `stopAutoplay` when tab containing it becomes invisible and `startAutoplay` when it becomes visible again\n Looks correct, no bugs should be there. But i would improve it as:\n\n``` js\n$$('.view.tab').on('show', function (e){\n  var mySwiper = $$('.swiper-container')[0].swiper;\n  if ($$(this).attr('id') === 'view-1') mySwiper.startAutoplay(); //tab with swiper became visible\n  else mySwiper.stopAutoplay(); //other tab became visible\n})\n```\n  Thanks, i think we can add this. But you can actually already specify badge color by specifying its `bg-` class like `<span class=\"badge bg-green\">1</span>` :)\n  Merged, thanks\n  Code looks correct. Do you still have this issue?\n  Looks like you forgot to specify `searchByItem` or `searchAll` methods in Virtual List settings\n http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/virtual-list.html#using-with-search-bar\n Yes, using data-context it is not a bulletproof method, especially for deep and complex data, and you can always get into mess with quotes, which is also depends on quote type (single/double) you use for HTML attributes. This was just for example that it is possible. I would better stick with the calling router's method and passing context there: \n\n```\nmainView.router.load({\n    template: Template7.templates.someTemplate,\n    context: data\n});\n```\n\nor (in case you have enabled template7Pages and you store them in separate files)\n\n```\nmainView.router.load({\n    url: 'something.html',\n    context: data\n});\n```\n As for videos, not really sure what happens, but good practices here (like with YouTube in Cordova apps) is to use some native Cordova plugins or using Vimeo/YouTube API to get the source of the video and add it as <video> tag, try to avoid using iframes\n  Merged, thanks\n  No, not normal, should be ok. Can't see such issue\n Closing due to inactivity \n  Sorry, but this is not an option for few reasons:\n1) Why do you think that `:after` will perform worse than numerous `grandient`s backgrounds? Do you have some proof of this, any performance tests?\n2) Such \"background\"-hairlines will bring huge limitation to styling and make impossible to use backgrounds in addition to hairlines on numerous elements\n  That is how it works, it removes pages from history with the same URL. Is this issue replicable with pure Framework7 or just in your Meteor/React implementation?\n Closing due to inactivity \n  It is by design, look at #690\n  Because Material theme doesn't support `dynamicNavbar`, so you don't need this prop there\n In Material there is no `through` layout, you have to use `fixed` one, where related navbar is always inside of the related page\n  Thanks, fixed in dev version\n  Just added them to custom build. But chips are parts of core, not available as a module \n  Yes, it won't work, as the navbar should be presented for correct routing. I don't know does the React provide such opportunity, but in F7 router's `content` parameter you can pass already rendered DOM not only HTML\n Can you give me a small demo app example, the basic things from what you have set up, so i can play with it and check more deeply?\n Ok, the issue when loading DOM is because of F7 detach it from React thing. So i've found a workaround, need to get back to loading it by HTML string and then render Navbar and Page separately:\n\napp.jsx:\n\n``` js\n$$(document).on('click', 'a[data-page]', function(e) {\n  var link = $$(e.target);\n  if (!link.is('a[data-page]')) {\n    link = link.parents('a[data-page]');\n  }\n\n  var page = link.attr('data-page'); //.replace('/', '_');\n  var view = link.attr('data-view');\n  var container;\n  if(view){\n    if(view == 'leftView'){\n      container = leftView;\n    } else {\n      container = mainView;\n    }\n  } else {\n    container = mainView;\n  }\n\n  $$(document).once('pageBeforeInit', '.page[data-page=\"' + page + '\"]', function (e) {\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n    // Render Page Content\n    ReactDOM.render(Utils.pages.getPage(page.name), page.container);\n\n    // Do the same separate rendering of Navbar Inner using React, e.g.:\n    // ReactDOM.render(Utils.navbars.getPage(page.name), page.navbarInnerContainer);\n\n    // Example with plain HTML:\n    $$(page.navbarInnerContainer).html(\n      '<div class=\"left\">' +\n        '<a href=\"#\" data-panel=\"left\" class=\"menu-panel-btn link open-panel icon-only\">' +\n          '<i class=\"icon icon-bars\"></i>' +\n        '</a>' +\n      '</div>' +\n      '<div class=\"center sliding\">Settings</div>'\n    );\n\n  });\n  // Load pummy navbar + page\n  container.router.load({\n    content: '<div class=\"navbar\"><div class=\"navbar-inner\"></div></div><div class=\"page with-subnavbar\" data-page=\"' + page + '\"></div>'\n  });\n}, true);\n```\n\nSettings.jsx (render only page content):\n\n``` jsx\nrender () {\n  return (\n        <div className=\"page-content\">\n          <div className=\"content-block-title\">Settings</div>\n          {this.renderPages()}\n        </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n Also make sure you have the same page name, you have it \"Settings\" and \"settings\", i guess should be the same case\n > What about the pushState issue when passing DOM in \"content\" property? Please, set pushState:true and you will see the error.\n\nIt is already fixed\n\n> It would be really cool to also handle React out of the box\n\nNot much chances at the moment. I'm not too familiar with it, and there are a lot of different libs that people want to see instead of React, i can't please everyone :)\n > The navbar disappears\n\nI guess this is because double navbar-inner you had there. You need to avoid that\n I don't know then as not too familiar with React. But anyway, it is just a Navbar, do you expect much of data-bindings there? Maybe you can just leave it to F7, like in my example which returning plain HTML that doesn't handled by React\n Also, have you checked this app? https://github.com/philipshurpik/framework7-react-base They use some kind of wrapper for navbar inner https://github.com/philipshurpik/framework7-react-base/blob/master/src/contact/contactView.js#L76\n Ok, cool then ;)\n I guess you have to enable domCache for views\n No, not forever, only for the previous page and while they are set as previous pages, and no any problems with it can happen. Otherwise, F7 will detach it and your React/Meteor implementation will be broken\n Closing due to inactivity \n  It is possible\n\n```\nvar data = {foo: 'bar'};\n$.ajax({\n    url: '...',\n    method: 'POST',\n    processData: false,\n    data: JSON.stringify(data)\n})\n```\n  Ok, will check the typos. As for your navbar, don't enable `dynamicNavbar` to keep it same\n Typos are fixed. I guess we can close it for now\n  I guess it is the same as here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/getting-started:how-to-use-jquery-in-projec\n  You can't do anything with router during it is animation, there is a \"lock\". You need to refresh your page first and then go back. Or do go back with `ignoreCache: true` and `force: true`\n Then do it in after `pageAfterAnimation`\n Yes, this is what i meant in my first comment ;)\n  Not supported by default\n  No, it won't reload in case of `domCache: true`\n  Sorry, but push state is supported only in main view\n  To be able to detach event you need to use \"named\" function:\n\n```\nfunction handleClick() {\n  //...\n}\nelm.on('click', handleClick);\nelm.off('click', handleClick);\n```\n\nThis is how events handling works in vanilla jS\n  This is default Cordova behavior. You need to use Keyboard plugin https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/keyboard take a look at `disableScrollingInShrinkView` and `shrinkView` methods\n  And why it can't show tabs? What is your code or screenshot or better live example?\n `navbar-through` is not supported as well as \"Through\" type layout in general in Material theme http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar-toolbar-layouts.html#through-layout\n  I guess you mean `page-content` not `content-block`.\n\nThe issue is that many devs use transparent/semi-transparent navbars/toolbars, or iOS9 gives opportunity to use backdrop blur (like in native apps). But such padding-to-margin change will break such opportunities\n  Or if your Views are Tabs, then `myApp.showTab('#view-2')` http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/tabs.html#show-tab-using-javascript\n  Or if your Views are Tabs, then `myApp.showTab('#view-2')` http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/tabs.html#show-tab-using-javascript\n I think we can close it as there is no further discussion \n  Please stop flooding with issues which are not issues or bugs. You probably better to keep them all in single thread as they basically have the same subject. Also, don't need to create issues for one-line custom solutions. As this one, you can control alignment using `justify-content` CSS property\n  This won't be implemented by default, because such kind of transitions work very slow in browser\n Anyway, i think this issues is related to/same as #604 \n  No, as it according to Material guide lines, each notification-single action\n  Already discussed here, with solution, can be achieved by using Swiper\n  This feature is also on roadmap\n  Is it somewhere in official Material guide or in some native Material app? It doesn't look like a good UI element and example\n Any progress with this issue?  Bread crumbs is not a mobile apps thing, there is no breadcrumbs in mobile apps. Also, it can be created with few lines of custom styles\n  Ok, this worth to implement\n Already in 1.3.5\n  As for FAB attachement - just set in child of required element - tab, page, view, etc. to get the desired behavior\nAs for Multiple FAB - what or who stops you to add multiple FABs and set required top/bottom position on them?\nAs for FAB - speed dial, will look, probably worth to implement it\nAs for Morph - not really possible to do common solution as it is too specific by itself\n  Again, this is easy to done manually. Just add 2 `item-input` and set required width on them\n  Again, it is just `float:left; width:50%` on action button\n  Will look, probably worth to implement, but again, can be done with few custom additional CSS styles on action sheet\n @J05HI please open a PR  `<a href=\"http://google.com\" class=\"external\">Open Google</a>`\n  Thanks, fixed now in dev version\n  All good, thanks\n  Hi, thanks. But this fix was a bit wrong. I've renamed parameter and added correct fix for that\n  Ok, checked on 5.0 emulator and 5.1 real device. Can't see such issue, it is working normally\n Do you still have this issue?\n  Merged, thanks\n  Push State is supported only by Main view. As for this issue, it is Android-specific. Check the Forum, there were a lot of solutions for that\n  Fixed now, but such usage doesn't have much sense :)\n At the moment parseUrlQuery is not intended to parse such complex queries, just for basics, as such queries usually parsed automatically by server-side language. Anyway, it is better to use JSON.serialize/parse in such case\n Actually, i am wondering do you really use it in this way with deep objects/queries? Can you show me real-life example of such usage? :)\n > Sorry, but if you do not know a real-life example of such usage, why you added this enhancement in serialization?\n\nThere are few real life examples when we need such serialization, basically it is when we need to send GET request with deep data, it is not good but i saw few weird APIs working like that. Also for forms with multiple selects/checkboxes (arrays). \n\nBut i don't know the real life example of parsing such thing on client side.\n\n> Why not in parsing?\n\nBecause it is damned not easy to parse such thing :D I will try it, but can't promise i will succeed in it :D\n  You have to specify also `pushStateRoot` in this case, otherwise F7 can't know root of the app\n > But couldn't that be the default?\n\nIt could, but it is not always the case. Will add it as the default value\n I haven't added this default separator, but better prevented to load such `/t` thing on app load. As this `location.origin` is not a solid solution which won't work for subfolder projects and cordova apps\n  Hi, looks interesting, but for some reason i can't replicate it to see such issue. Maybe you can give me small guide on how can i replicate it?\n Ok, thanks\n Ok, i see what you mean. As for doubled hashes, the additional hash in front of page name was added intentionally. \n\nFor example, with your fix. If i open an app (first time, when there is no any states in history) by url `myapp.com/!#/about`. How will i know, should i load inline page or make Ajax request? Need to think here how to cover such cases. Optionally i can just add parameters to specify full URL rules for such pages, so by default it can be like `#{{name}}`.\n\nAs for `preventPushStateOnLoad`. This parameter is intended for different case. For example in mobile Safari, it fires falsy pop state event for some reason. And setting this parameter to `true` blocks `popstate` event handling until window is loaded to fix this issue. But i understand you, its name is a bit confusing, probably it can do what you purposed and rename the current parameter to different\n I am ok with https://github.com/robert-blankenship/Framework7/commit/35da0584f05d54acff749fc97c5ed7f7a9f5f9f0 . Yes, you can make separate PR for it, or i can merge it manually, just let me know\n  Please, see the README file:\n\n> Framework7' JS and CSS files in Kitchen Sink are temporary linked to build/ to make development process easier on this stage. So to make it work you need to build Framework7 (see Build section) or to re-link JS and CSS files to dist/ folder.\n  Ok, seems to be everything is good. Merged, thanks\n  It is ok, but just `overflow: hidden;` on .item-inner should be enough, can you remove `text-overflow:ellipsis` and i will merge it?\n Merged manually, thanks\n  Fixed\n  First of all, Dom7 doesn't allow to create 'html`elements, as it doesn't create documents during this. And actually there is no much sense in it. Also second`text`(context) parameter in your`$$('p', test)` can be only HTMLElement, as again there is no much sense to use something else there. So this will work:\n\n``` js\nvar test = $$('<div><p>test</p></div>');\nconsole.log( $$('p', test[0]).html() ); // -> 'test'\n```\n\nWhich is also doesn't make much sense :D More strait forward will be this:\n\n``` js\nvar test = $$('<div><p>test</p></div>');\nconsole.log ( test.find('p').html() ); // -> 'test'\n```\n  Thanks, will fix it. But for such issues in future post it in appropriate repo at https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Website\n Fixed\n  You can find few polyfills in the end of this article http://www.sitepoint.com/css-position-sticky-introduction-polyfills/\n I think we can close it as Chrome-specific issue, not the F7\n  Like the idea and looks good. I am only afraid that this `if (dayDate === new Date(range[i]).getTime())` with passed object can throw an error or warning. Let's place `for-to` check in first and i will merge it, like:\n\n```\nif (range[i].from || range[i].to) {\n  ...\n}\nelse if (dayDate === new Date(range[i]).getTime()) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n Thanks, merged\n  Thanks for noting that. I fixed it with a little bit different way not to output mobal-buttons at all when we don't have any buttons\n  It is not a Framework7 issue http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/bugs-and-issues:ios9-fixed-navbar-stays-not\n\nUse cordova keyboard plugin. It has options to shrink view on keyboard open.\n  Thanks for this. I just push a bit different fix to get rid of events at all, and to cover all other cases when it is initialized in hidden panel or popup or wherever else\n  Because Material theme uses image for that instead. You may just add this CSS to your material app:\n\n```\ni.icon.icon-plus {\n  font-size: 0;\n}\n```\n  No, sorry, it is not possible, these are core elements\n If you don't use Template7 and don't enable it in your app, you won't get any conflicts\n Yes, it is disabled by default :)\n  Yes, there is an issue. Actually this method was recently implemented and will appear in next release soon. But anyway `$$('.view .navbar').prependTo('.view .page');` is basically the same as `$$('.view .page').prepend('.view .navbar');`\n\nAs for two of your examples, first method is better (for View) as it set more `global` styles and should be more correct\n > Then this page should be updated to implement the best method, no ?\n\nI guess, will update it\n\n> EDIT: when I use your method it actually add \".view .navbar\" as text. Weird.\n\nThen this:\n\n```\n$$('.view .page').prepend($$('.view .navbar'));\n```\n Ok, checked again, there is no difference for \"...-fixed\" class used on `pages` or `view` so docs is correct\n  Call Swiper's `.update` method when tab your tab becomes visible, otherwise there is no way to calculate swiper sizes in hidden tab, for example:\n\n```\n$('#my-tab').on('show', function(){\n  $(this).find('.swiper-container')[0].swiper.update()\n});\n```\n @ausiuming there is no `show` event for popup, look in docs, it is `open`. And `swiper.update()` will work\n  Can't replicate it. What is your cordova/device OS version?\n I have cordova 5.1.1 and don't see such issue. Will check with 5.3.3 but actually i don't see any reasons for such errors. Maybe problem on your side, how do you add/close them?\n Weird, do you use any Cordova plugins? `WKWebView`?\n > Tada! The bug in webkit appear when the onClose callback (the same used as onClick callback) contains the app.closeNotification.\n\nDidn't understand, problem is solved?\n Did some investigation and \n\n> the event handler is called more than one time\n\nno, it doesn't called more than once, you can sure in it by putting `console.log` there. So issue can be fixed by using none/single-prefixed event. But i won't do it at the moment as it can break a lot of Androids, as many of them reports falsy support of unprefixed event. \n\nSo let's keep it opened for a while as not really an issue, at least it doesn't break and affect anything except warning message in console\n  But you have callbacks in calendar, right? Where you can highlight manually all values between first and last\n  Thanks, chat cleared\n  Sorry, but why? It cannot be common solution and may produce more problems/questions. Default/designed behavior supposed to change status-bar color with opened panel, not moving it. Check for example iOS native Facebook app, and the same is done in Kitchen Sink for example\n Sorry, i can't agree with this as it is highly depends on app design. What we have now is the most common and easiest to change/tweak way: to change background color or to add transform like in your example. Also there is an idea behind the current realization, if you have half white - half black statusbar background (like on fig 3) then status bar itself can be unreadable as it can be only white or black, so that is why it is easier to handle whole status bar. Actually what is on fig1 is fine, have you checked iOS Facebook app? It and many other native apps behave in the way of Fig1\n I know Jawbone UP, they basically hide status bar when panel opened)). Probably we can make your proposed behavior optional, for example with additional class on status bar. I am just afraid that most of users/devs won't know what is happened with status bar and why it is moving, just trying to avoid such questions in future :D\n @mgesmundo if you could update this PR accordingly that would be great  Are there any errors in browser console when you do it from PhoneGap app?\n issue can be only on your server side or with wrong phonegap configuration. Make sure you have whitelisted your api domain\n Closing as no further response/discussion\n  Thanks, fixed\n  Nope, sorry, it is intended as it is used for development purpose and there is a note about it in readme:\n\n> Framework7' JS and CSS files in Kitchen Sink are temporary linked to build/ to make development process easier on this stage. So to make it work you need to build Framework7 (see Build section) or to re-link JS and CSS files to dist/ folder.\n\nBut i will change it for future dist releases/tags\n  As i see in spec it has `1440 x 2560` resolution, so basically yes, should be `pixel-ratio-2`. Probably device or browser reports false `3x`\n @Papipo what do you see when you launch it just in Chrome instead of Cordova, does it also says `pixel-ratio-3` there?\n It is weird as 2560 doesn't divided by 3. You can try to add this code to your app:\n\n``` js\nif (myApp.device.android && myApp.device.pixelRatio > 2) {\n  $('html').removeClass('pixel-ratio-3').addClass('pixel-ratio-2');\n}\n```\n @Papipo nothing bad will happen)\n > are you going to include something on Framework7 so the workaround isn't needed?\n\nNo, as i guess it is current device-specific issue, not the issue for all Androids\n  Right there is a lock which doesn't allow to load new page during animation in same View. As a solution you may also try to use App's `preroute` parameter http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/init-app.html#example-with-preroute\n  Thanks, i have merged them manually and in a bit different moments and with a bit different names :) I choose different moments to differentiate them from basic 'touchstart/move/end` events and to be executed only when PTR container is moved\n  Have you tried it on other devices? Could be device-specific issue\n  Shouldn't be hard:\n\n```\n$$('.accordion-item').on('opened', function(){\n    var pageContent = $$(this).parents('.page-content');\n    var newScroll = $$(this).offset().top - 44 + pageContent[0].scrollTop;\n    $$(this).parents('.page-content').scrollTop(newScroll, 400);\n});\n```\n\nAnd please, use Forum for questions\n  Actually it can work but with this syntax in your case `{{../url_query.id}}` or `{{@root.url_query.id}}`\n  There is no library need for that, it is native JS event, so you can use it like:\n\n```\n$(something).on('touchstart', function (e) {\n  var force = e.targetTouches[0].force;\n  //do something depending on force\n})\n```\n  Closing as there is no further discussion\n  Sorry, it depends on browser performance, not on processor, and Android's browsers can't be proud with their performance. \n  > if I use virtual list, and then use `scrollToItem(index)` to target index, will the Framework7 render previous indexes?\n\nNo, it won't render previous items, it is safe to use\n  Thanks\n  Yes, there are plans for something like new page transition, but later\n There hasn't been a response by the issues owner in 20 days.\r\nThis issue **will be closed in 7 days** if no further response is submitted  Hi,\nAll colour related styles are moved to the separate additional `framework7.ios.colors.min.css` file, so just include this stylesheet after main F7 stylesheet\n  Will be good to see this in English\n I guess it is not actual anymore and i couldn't replicate it\n  Makes sense, thanks\n  Your fix is ok :+1: , waiting for PR\n  No, sorry, these icons are just for demo purpose. You can replace them with your own icons, or add with different colors by changing/copying current icons in CSS\n  Use \"Fixed\" layout type for navbars (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar-toolbar-layouts.html#fixed-layout) in Material theme and disable dynamicNavbar \n  Hi,\nCan't replicate this issue. What is your device and OS version?\n I still can't replicate it. Can you check your `mainView.allowPageChange` property, i guess for some reason it is still `false` at this moment?\n  Real device or emulator?\n Do you still have this issue?\n  It is on desktop on on mobile device?\n Ok, see the issue, will check it\n Closing as fixed\n  Thanks, will take a look at it\n Thanks, i merged it manually as it need to be done for both themes and for colour themes\n  Do you change CSS `overflow` property on something?\n Ok, i will check it more deeply on this weekend\n Ok, finally had time to take a look at this. The solution of this particular issue is simple, just add this rule to your CSS:\n\n``` css\n.views {\n  overflow: hidden;\n} \n```\n  Yes, in this case panel doesn't trigger any events because state of the panel wasn't changed\n  Thanks, but first of all, i can accept commits in `dist/` folder, revert them, as you modify the current release. Also about the issue. I can't replicate it, but i have tried only in home screen webapp and in safari. So is it happens only in Cordova?\n Ok, as i guess, the issue probably because of in webview/cordova the keyboard is not a part of webview. I also don't really like this fix as it is a bit hacky and checking window size during touchmove can be a bit slow. Can you try the following, in this place where we add listeners https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/pull-to-refresh.js#L160-L162 try to add one more event handler after:\n\n```\neventsTarget.on('touchcancel`, handleTouchEnd);\n```\n\nMaybe (hopefully) it will trigger `touchcancel` event in this case?\n Ok, i will have time check it more deeply on this weekend\n @lexaux could you resolve the conflicts please?  Sorry, don't know either how to fix it, it is a long playing FireFox issue. The only fix here will be remove those `:after` borders and replace them with plain CSS `border`\n You know, you can add the following CSS rule:\n\n```\n.list-block .item-title {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nBut i am not sure that it will not break something else\n Just google `firefox position absolute in flexbox` some of the first results lead to FF issues \n  What's the status of this?  You need to use Accordion List View (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/accordion.html#accordion-list-view) with Checkboxes and Radios (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/checkboxes-radios.html#.VdOBn1Ptmko)\n This code can't be valid by idea as you have `label>label>input` You probably need to use the basic structure from docs:\n\n```\n<li class=\"accordion-item\">\n  <label class=\"label-checkbox item-content accordion-item-toggle\">\n    ...\n  </label>\n  <div class=\"accordion-item-content\">\n    ..nested UL here\n  </div>\n</li>\n```\n The problem in `label>label>input` is not the semantic. It is about how the label works. If you click parent label it will check/uncheck all nested inputs. Anyway, is this problem is still actual?\n So i guess we can close it? Reopen if you still have issues with it\n  Sorry, according to styles this is centred and depend on browser implementation. In iOS i see it 100% match which is enough for me to leave it like it is not:\n![s](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/9292888/45781fca-4419-11e5-81ab-b513fad5060b.jpg)\n\nThe first navbar is from native Settings app, and the second one is from F7. The only difference i see is the size if icon, on native app it is a little bit larger\n  No, sorry. According to the guidelines (and you may see it any native app) buttons in button row should be the equal size. If you need such solution for your app, just add mentioned css to your app css, but not for everyone\n  Sorry, i can't see such issue. Do you have a link where i can see such issue?\n  It is but the problem is that navbar and toolbar should be above the page (like in native apps), they are not stacked on single layer. With such chosen layout you can make navbar/toolbar semitransparent (in iOS9 i'll add blurred background), and it can be dynamically hidden/shown. With flexbox layout where they all stack on single level it will be impossible\n  Not by default, but it is not hard to do this using API, for example:\n\n```\n$.get('somepage.html', function(data){\n  myApp.popup('<div class=\"popup\">' + data + '</div>')\n});\n```\n  Agree, thanks\n  First of all it will be good to see how you add it, maybe some code examples?\n  Thanks, but no changes should be committed to the `dist/` folder as it will modify the current release. If you revert changes from `dist/index.html` file, i will merge it\n Thanks\n Yes, it will be already fixed in next release\n  I guess you can use something like this:\n\n```\n<i class=\"icon\"><span class=\"material-icons\">face</span><span class=\"badges bd-red\">5</span></i>\n```\n Closing as there is no further discussion \n  Thanks\n  Thanks\n  These themes use different patterns and logic in many places, it is not just colors and sizes, so yes, it is impossible. This may help you http://www.idangero.us/framework7/tutorials/maintain-both-ios-and-material-themes-in-single-app.html\n  Do you use Lazy Load on it or you have usual media list there?\n Ok, should be fixed now in dev version\n  Sorry, have no idea what happens on windows phone. Maybe you see any errors in console?\n Closing is seems to be not F7-related issue. Reopen if you found out it is F7-related\n  Sorry, missed this issue for some reason. Should be fixed now\n  In this case you should put it inside of subnavbar\n  Sorry, i don't see much sense it - to use picker without picker :) You can just reuse some of the code part when keyboard became opened to add additional padding to page and scroll it https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/picker.js#L437-L458\n Can this be closed?  There is a Swiper for that. Duplicate of #542\n No, they not deprectated\n  For app https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar\nFor web https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android\n\nUse Forum for questions\n  There is a helper `tablet-` classe http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/grid.html#.Vb49cpPtmko\n\nPlease, use Forum for questions\n  I am not too familiar with Angular, but there are a lot of solutions on the web\n\n#35\n\nhttps://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template\n\nClosing as non the F7 issue\n  Sorry, Safari 5 is very old and outdated browser. It is not supported\n  Fixed, thanks\n Sorry but this commit doesn't change anything about data. And as i tested everything works for me\n  Fixed, thanks\n  I got your idea by I really don't like the event name. And I guess it is only for closing swipeout element. Maybe it is better to just close it automatically or configure via dat- attribute?\n  > Where I can see how to apply the events in the documentation?\n\nThe same as in jQuery, using jQuery or built in lib http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/dom.html\n\n> Where I can see where some js code, validate fields, add data .... etc ?\n\nOn the web, they will be the same as for jQuery. There is no specific things for F7\n\nP.S. It is better to use Forum for question. GitHub is for issues\n  Sorry, don't understand what do you mean. Can you explain it more detailed and what have you tried?\n I will consider it, but it should be done without a hassle manually using Calendar API\n http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/calendar.html\n  Can this be closed  Closing as no further response or discussion \n  @J05HI Why?  The same, attributes should be intact (adding/deleting) when using `.data` methods\n  Thanks, i removed these next/prev classes manually. Should be better now\n  Closing as there is no further discussion and not really replicable\n  Closing as duplicate of #671 \n  I think yes, we can close it for now\n  Closing due to inactivity \n  @johnjamesjacoby yes, it is definitely iOS issue, nothing can do with that at the moment. Hope this will be fixed to final release\n  Sorry, but it doesn't compatible with `pushState` because it is not possible to modify browser history\n      What have you tried? It works with:\n\n```\n$$('.page-content').scrollTop(100, 600);\n```\n    What is your code related to closing the popup?\n Can't replicate this error. Need more information about how do you open popup and full popup HTML content\n Do you have a live link? Because with this code, everything is fine for me. Problem could be related to something else\n Issue seems to be related to Require.js. Need to dig a bit deeper, will look when have a bit more time\n  Sorry, i am not sure that i understand what you mean. Can you describe it more detailed?\n  If your virtual list is not on home page, then you have to use page callbacks (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/page-callbacks.html) to init it, for example:\n\n```\napp.onPageInit('somepage', function(){\n  var vl = app.virtualList(...);\n});\n```\n  I think that it is a bit early for iOS 9 specific thinks, as it can be changed in next iOS beta :D Let's wait at least for a month\n already in release\n  Sorry, but i am not fully understand you. Can you describe more detailed what do you mean?\n    No, it is Android, and its browser is that what you see. If you are creating Cordova app, then you may use Crosswalk project to replace bad and slow webview with Chrome\n @nimeso it is a general problem old Androids, i don't that it is possible to do something with it. But in Chrome, as i see, everything is fine\n @aries1980 did you test Framework7 website (http://idangero.us/framework7/) or Framework7 itself (http://idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/)? Because there are no such scripts in Framework7 itself\n @aries1980 ah, yes, that could also be an issue. But, anyway, overall scrolling performance in Framework7 on Android < 4.4 is not smooth\n  Yes, finally they delivered something we can use :) I haven't installed yet to check that, but i am interesting about performance. On which iPad you did test it? Because i think to enable it by default for all bars and modals if it works smoothly on iPad 2\n @FWeinb are you aware this PR has merge conflicts?\r\nIt would be great if you could resolve those and consider @valnub 's points @J05HI we know, this is iOS/Safari ONLY.  Thanks but sorry, i will keep it because it is used in Gulp source builder, also it is harmless and may be required in future\n  That is true, will fix it, thanks\n  You need to init Swiper or call its `update` method when it becomes visible. \nClosing as not related to Framework7\n Cube effect? Not seeing it in the docs. Got a link? So how is the cube effect supposed to work and why do you think it's supposed to be present Right so the docs are [here](http://idangero.us/swiper/api/)  What the Android version and browser version?\n      `formToJSON` method name will not be changed, and it will return JS object, not JSON `string`. Where says that JSON is a mandatory string?\n  What is Android version and what is the version of browser?\n  You have to specify `searchList` parameter\n And, with your syntax it is now fixed and will work in dev version\n    There is a `reload` and `reloadPrevious` options for this in Router, or short `.router.reloadPreviousPage` method\n @braininteractive is this issue resolved?  Sorry, iOS 6, and especially iPad 1 are not supported, they are too outdated\n  The same, iOS 6, and especially iPad 1 are not supported, they are too outdated\n  Screenshots will be helpful\n If you need it on right, then just put it in `.item-after` like on \"List View\" example page\n  Sorry, why your feature is only for modals? Then it should be for every page/component. Also, we don't need to show `jade`, only `html` and `js`\n  I would avoid that for many reasons, for example:\n- It breaks native behavior, as pages in iOS apps are loading in this way. If you want something to pop up from bottom then there is a  `popup` for that case. This is what iOS users are used to\n- swipe back will not work or its logic will be not straight forward for user\n- it can be done manually without a hassle. Animation is based on CSS animation. So if it is really required, developer may add by himself in CSS for selected pages\n  Do you really care what html-spec states about it? I am not, as it works like it should everywhere and will work, it hasn't any cons, and of course - it doesn't affect performance or anything else . Anyway, you can just replace all those `divs` with `spans` if it really matters for you ;)\n > is there any good reason why you use divs instead of spans within label-tags\n\nYes, because they are block elements by default and to keep the same consentient HTML layout through all list-block elements\n\n> it is not valid html. Automated tests would complain such structure\n\nI'll ask again :) Who ever cares about valid HTML? It became not relevant since HTML5 ... and especially for mobile apps\n  > If client code tries to close same modal more than once, modal will not shows anymore.\n\nHow to replicate this issue? For me, everything works fine\n In actual dev version, in Kitchen Sink. Open modals page, click on \"Popup\" button. Then in console type:\n\n```\nmyApp.closeModal('.demo-popup');\nmyApp.closeModal('.demo-popup');\nmyApp.closeModal('.demo-popup');\n```\n\nAfter that you still will be able to open it\n Or even\n\n```\nmyApp.closeModal('.demo-popup');\nsetTimeout(function(){\n    myApp.closeModal('.demo-popup');\n    myApp.closeModal('.demo-popup');\n},150);\n```\n\nStill working\n  Merged, thanks\n  It is not a memory leak. It is how browser's garbage collector works. When we remove element/node from DOM, browser doesn't remove it from memory, but removes it later. So you shouldn't worry about it\n @aries1980 unfortunately we can't control it much in mobile apps/browsers. It also depends on developers, which should remove/destroy components (like Swiper, Virtual List, etc.) on pages removing (when they are not needed)\n  Will answer you on forum\n  I will think about it. Just don't want to add 3 event listeners for each switch, which is not really main element in app\n I'm fairly sure this has been committed to master  Seems to be everything good, merged, thanks a lot!\n  Need to see live example or JSFiddle\n You need to fix block height if you want to make it scrollable. For example:\n\n``` css\n.tab .content-block {\n  height: -webkit-calc(100vh - 44px - 70px - 44px - 56px);\n  height: calc(100vh - 44px - 70px - 44px - 56px);\n}\n```\n Not sure, seem like iOS or YouTube issue\n But you can try to use YouTube API just to get the Video URL and use it as usual embed `<video>` tag\n Cool, thanks :+1: \n  There is a `page.query` object that you can access in Page Data http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/pages.html#page-data\n  Thanks, merged!\n  There is a Dom7.serializeObject method already available http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/dom.html#.VU4MwdN_Oko\n\nYou can also just use `JSON.stringify(data)` to pass in Ajax, because there is no much sense in serializing deep objects and arrays\n  Docs are pretty useful: http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/page-callbacks.html\n\n> Page Callbacks become very handy when you need to execute specific code for specific pages\n\n```\nmyApp.on('pageInit', function(page){\n  var mySwiper = myApp.swiper('.swiper-container', {\n    //...\n  }\n});\n```\n\nKitchen sink could help too https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/kitchen-sink/js/kitchen-sink.js#L478\n  Fixed, thanks\n With this commit https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/a4e78b50d71ef41a66ed2a7efb16394d40a1d3c9\n  Thanks, fixed\n  Not sure about it. It is not required for default/system fonts, and could produce performance issues. So lets leave it up to developer, because it is always easy to add these two lines in custom app's CSS file\n  I am a bit confused, isn't it supported for images in messages? \n So it would be good live example where it is not working\n Be careful. It should be `data-src` on img, not `data-lazy`. With `data-src` it works\n If \"by passing\" you mean insert it into message field, then it will not work. Because you need to reinit lazy loading for page. And there is no much sense in it for user to send message and see lazy loaded image, i think. But if you add this HTML in initial page html, then, on page load it works as expected\n  Sorry, but i can't replicate this issue. Maybe you have live example or JSFiddle where i can see and check it?\n Closing as no further response\n  Yep, seems like a bug. Will fix it\n  I can ask you the same, why it should use `em` or `rem` and not a `px`? I chose  `px` because they are much more widely used and more people understand it much better than `em` or `rem`\n  No need to duplicate the same issue in different repos. Will close this one, and give you an anwer in Template7's one\n  No solutions, Android doesn't support multitouch gestures events\n @boynet \n\n> it possible to detect pinch event in android, i thinking of implement it using hammerjs, I'll submit it as plugin or something\n\nYes, Hammer provides some kind of hacky abstraction on this. Would be great if you can do it as plugin or **something** :)\n Your code uses third-party \"Touchy\" library for that, i'll take a look on it. But if there are a lot of code for it, then i will not add it, because don't want to add a lot of code for none-target platform, becaue Framework7, currently, is designed for iOS\n @boynet \nYou can pass these methods:\n\n```\nhammertime.on( 'pinchstart', pb.onSlideGestureStart );\nhammertime.on( 'pinchmove', pb.onSlideGestureChange );\nhammertime.on( 'pinchend', pb.onSlideGestureEnd );\n```\n\ninto PB's `onOpen` callback.\n\nBut with this  `var hammertime = new Hammer(gestureSlide[0]);` i am not sure. As you may see in code it is dynamic and `gestureSlide` is assigned when gesture begins https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/photo-browser.js#L375\n Maybe instead of gestureSlide, you may try to just use all its slides?\n Hmm, this looks correct. Did you try to `console.log` some variables/steps inside of `onSlideGestureStart/Change/End` methods? Probably hammer could pass there something different\n Should work if you put in in `onOpen` callback:\n\n``` js\n...\nonOpen: function (pb) {\n  var target = pb.params.loop ? pb.swiper.slides : pb.slides;\n  target.each(function( index ) {\n    var hammertime = new Hammer(this);\n    hammertime.get('pinch').set({ enable: true });\n    hammertime.on( 'pinchstart', pb.onSlideGestureStart );\n    hammertime.on( 'pinchmove', pb.onSlideGestureChange );\n    hammertime.on( 'pinchend', pb.onSlideGestureEnd );\n  });\n}\n```\n  First of all i see only two cards in your Code. And i will recommend to separate .col and .card and use the following structure:\n\n```\n.row\n  .col-25\n    .card\n  .col-50\n    .card\n  .col-25\n    .card\n```\n\nTo keep cards inside of columns, and yes, probably, you'll need to remove margin-left/right on such cards\n  You need to call Swiper's `.update` method when tab with it becomes visible, because when it is hidden there is no way to calculate its size. So something like\n\n```\n$('.tab#tab2').on('show', function(){\n  var swiperInstance = $(this).find('.swiper-container')[0].swiper;\n  if (swiperInstance) swiperInstance.update();\n})\n```\n  It is not really designed for panels and popups. And at least in popup, if you have full pages (view, pages, page, page-content) structure, you may try to trigger 'lazy' events when popup opened:\n\n```\n$('.popup').on('opened', function(){\n  $(this).find('img.lazy').trigger('lazy');\n})\n```\n Closing as no further response or discussion\n  Yes, as in any other View:\n\n```\n.popup\n  .view\n     .pages\n       .page\n         ...etc\n```\n\nJust follow Layout types documentation http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar-toolbar-layouts.html\n\nBy the way, as you may see in any demo app/kitchen sink, popups have navbar, look also there\n  It is a security restriction for input file. Look for solution on StackOverflow:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/210643/in-javascript-can-i-make-a-click-event-fire-programmatically-for-a-file-input/210652#210652\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/6974228/problem-using-click-on-inputtype-file\n  Why is that? Single helper could have more than hash. Which template caused you issue?\n @yujinjin is this issue still valid?  They don't required, but i guess they can't make something bad and doesn't depend on any performance.  By default F7 do `preventDefault` for any link that doesn't match to \"external\" condition, you can see it here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/clicks.js#L236\n\nSo it is totally up to you, use them or not\n  It is good to see in live example. But if you use inline picker, then you should definitely reInit Picker too, and in any case, with current page reloading picker will loose its linked `<input>`. Anyway, page reloading is always not a great option\n Closing as no further response\n  Oh man, kudos to you! I guess you spent some time by making this cool picture with pages :+1: \nYes, in this case page query will be lost, because F7 doesn't save/store page data in this case, because when you on Page 3 then Page 1 will be removed from Dom and memory. \n\nIf you don't have too deep navigation, then i can recommend you to enable `domCache` to keep previous pages in Dom, and its data/state should be safe\n @sanks it was fixed here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/674\n @sanks then i need detailed steps on how to replicate it. Also you wrote that you use `pageBeforeInit` - this callback is useless with `domCache` for \"back\" pages, if so, then change it to `pageReinit`\n  I will merge it, and add additional check for attribute. But man, you are the first with such issue for a long time, and i can't replicate it in any way. That is something wrong with browser\n  We may close it\n  If you mean to go back to the first page on your `loginPage` view, then you may do something like:\n\n```\nloginPage.router.back({\n  force: 'true',\n  pageName: 'firstPageName`\n});\n```\n\nwhere _firstPageName_ is the page name of your first (initial) page in loginPage view\n Try to specify url instead of pageName:\n\n```\nloginPage.router.back({\n  force: 'true',\n  url: 'main.html`,\n  ignoreCache: true\n});\n```\n\nOtherwise it will good if i can see at live example\n  Thanks, should be fixed now\n Sure, added it\n  Fixed in dev version\n  That is because it follows Apple design guides. You don't need to change the source file, just overwrite its size in your own CSS file\n I guess we can close it\n  That is because pushState has some blocking mechanism, and because init app with required it is just not unblocking. Try to call `$(window).trigger('load')` right after you init app\n I just pushed new commit where app has new `pushStatePreventOnLoad` parameter, you can set it to `false` and problem should gone\n  Thanks, anyway we need to check the selector, but i'll probably will do its check to compare with `undefined`. Btw, how did you get mentioned issue?\n  I am ok with any 2xx status but not 3xx, they are not really success. They are mostly for browser or direct  request coding on server-side. For example, if you go to `http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/` and type in console (CORS in browser should be enabled):\n\n```\n$$.get('http://idangero.us', function (data){console.log(data)})\n```\n\nIn network inspector you will see actually 2 requests: \n- one to `http://idangero.us` with 301 status (moved permanently) \n- and then browser will do the second request/redirect to `http://www.idangero.us` and respond with data and 200 status\n\nIn this case we even can't catch the 3xx status. So i think it should be removed from \"success\" check, as it can produce unwanted results\n Right, so why we need to deal with it in XHR logic?) So can we keep it as `xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300`? At least, i will feel safe with it\n Merged, thanks\n  Cool with first one, but can't accept this one https://github.com/johnjamesjacoby/Framework7/commit/9bd3f5bed49611bf62e4146f96526d0458b58000\n\nIt is a bit wrong, during touchmove event we still get distance in rendered pixels, not in physical, so you will just highly increase this distance, effects could be unintentional. So i think, it is better to leave it on developer decision, because you can always pass this parameter manually:\n\n```\nnew Framework7({\n  fastClicksDistanceThreshold: 10 * window.devicePixelRatio\n})\n```\n Yep, so will you change the PR or you want me to merge it manually? Btw, do PR only in src/ files, not in dist/\n  Right, because you can't use router methods until router is in progress. So `#` or class \"external\" on link will do its job\n @GuillaumeBiton Can we close this, problem is solved?\n  No, not possible by default. You may create popup with its initialized View, and when you click on this link you need to open popup and then use Router API to navigate Popup view to this page\n Maybe i'll add it, but it is easy for custom use. You may even just do it using custom XHR call:\n\n``` html\n<a class=\"link popup-link external\" href=\"page/about.html\">About</a>\n```\n\n``` js\n$(document).on('click', '.popup-link', function (e){\n    e.preventDefault();\n    $.get($(this).attr('href'), function (content){\n        myApp.popup('<div class=\"popup\">' + content + '</div>');\n    });\n});\n```\n\nAnd that is all, you have permanent working solution :)\n  Yes, but these icons are for demo purpose only, they are not a part of F7, you should use your own icons (SVG or PNG or font) in your app.\n  Ok, will add it\n  Sorry, IE 8 and IE 9 are not supported\n  Thanks, fixed in dev version\n  Googling says that it is pure FF issue https://www.google.ru/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=firefox%20getcomputedstyle%20in%20iframe\n Not sure that here could be a fix. Only if you find out how to replace it and retrieve element styles in Dom7 .css() method\n  Sorry, i don't understand what do you mean with this. If you want to use custom events you also need to trigger them manually like `$$('[data-page=\"index\"]').trigger('show')` I probably should close it as issue not described well\n  Thanks\n  Issue with min/maxDate and year switch just fixed in src.\n\nBut about touchMove and not working onDayClick handler, i can't replicate it. Can you guide me step by step on how to replicate this issue?\n  Yes, already known problem, it is a pure Chrome bug that became broken in Chrome 39/40, and it fine in Safari and in iOS. You may found a lot of information about it on Stack Overflow. And this bug is already fixed in Chrome 42\n  Are you at last version of F7? Textarea is inside of Swiper?\n  It is really really hard to say for me as these fast clicks are driving me crazy a bit. Anyway, just found one issue that is fixed now, probably related, check it\n There were issue with this option when attr tapping something, it still was true and doesn't allowed any programmatic clicks\n Anyway, you can always do stopPropagation or stopImmediatePropagation and handle these links manually\n There is the same thing here, just add \"no-fastclick\" class to such element\n  Looks good, did you tested it well, nothing breaks?\n Ok, just wondering can you give me a real world example where not checking hasOwnProperty can break things here in XHR?\n  Sorry, don't understand what do you mean? Maybe screenshots or video?\n Ok, i see now, will fix it\n  Does work for me. I hope you change `option.mehod`, `option.data`, `url` to real values?) Also if you has JSONP request, then it will not work, because it doesn't use XHR request at all\n jsonp cannot be async because it doesnt use xhr\n  As i remember this code was very important, as on some platforms, it push to history index page without even navigate it, especially on iOS\n  Please, look at change log and new search bar docs\n You probably just need to add \"searchbar-init\" to your searchbar\n    Can you show your HTML?\n I will fix that, but now you should reinit your swiper using pageReInit event for this page:\n\n```\nmyApp.onPageReinit('wonddashboard', function () {\n  wondSliper.update(true)\n})\n```\n This is fixed in 1.0.3\n  Yeap, just rudiment from previous swiper, will remove it as not required\n But this will not resolve it, but you may just use .blur() on elements within onTouchMove callback. I will recheck it\n I think we can close it, as this option was removed, and some improvements were made in Swiper related to inputs\n  Thanks\n  Do you initialize your Chart's code inside of pageInit and when it is in DOM?\n Sounds like something wrong :) Maybe you have a live link or code examples?\n It is very not good, you should know that browser never parse scripts in HTML files that loaded by Ajax, you should move all this logic (and no sense in F7 plugin there) to your my-app.js, something like:\n\n``` js\nmyApp.onPageInit('anayltics', function(page){\n//your code for init charts should be there\n\n    var randomScalingFactor = function(){ return Math.round(Math.random()*100)};\n    var lineChartData = {\n        labels : [\"January\",\"February\",\"March\",\"April\",\"May\",\"June\",\"July\"],\n        datasets : [\n            {\n                label: \"My First dataset\",\n                fillColor : \"rgba(220,220,220,0.2)\",\n                strokeColor : \"rgba(220,220,220,1)\",\n                pointColor : \"rgba(220,220,220,1)\",\n                pointStrokeColor : \"#fff\",\n                pointHighlightFill : \"#fff\",\n                pointHighlightStroke : \"rgba(220,220,220,1)\",\n                data : [randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor()]\n            },\n            {\n                label: \"My Second dataset\",\n                fillColor : \"rgba(151,187,205,0.2)\",\n                strokeColor : \"rgba(151,187,205,1)\",\n                pointColor : \"rgba(151,187,205,1)\",\n                pointStrokeColor : \"#fff\",\n                pointHighlightFill : \"#fff\",\n                pointHighlightStroke : \"rgba(151,187,205,1)\",\n                data : [randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor(),randomScalingFactor()]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\n    var ctx = document.getElementById(\"line_chart\").getContext(\"2d\");\n    window.myLine = new Chart(ctx).Line(lineChartData, {\n        responsive: true\n    });\n\n\n});\n\n```\n You should put to this pageIni everything what related to this page\n  Don't understand. Show live link with issue\n  For example?\n It is not a valid HTML and will be ignored by browser, probably using some data- attributes\n Added in dev with the following use case:\n\n```\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"item-link smart-select\" data-back-onselect=\"true\" data-back-text=\"New Customer\">\n              <select name=\"fruits\">\n                <option value=\"Consumer\" data-option-color=\"red\">Consumer</option>\n                <option value=\"Business\" data-option-class=\"bold-option\">Business</option>\n              </select>\n              <div class=\"item-content\">\n                <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                  <div class=\"item-title\">Account Type</div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </a>\n```\n\n`data-option-color` will be applied as `color-` class directly on item-title in smart select page\n`data-option-class` will add class to `<li>` in smart select page, so to make option bold:\n\n```\n.bold-option .item-title {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n  Merged, thanks\n  LazyLoad currently is not compatible with Swiper, but you may just hide images there and show only for active slide in CSS:\n\n``` css\n.swiper-slide img {\n  display:none;\n}\n.swiper-slide-active img, \n.swiper-slide-next img, \n.swiper-slide-prev img {\n  display:block;\n}\n```\n Fixed in 1.0.3 as swiper support lazy load now\n  I see, the problem not seems pretty hard, but probably a bit confusing because it has a lot of different ways to implement it. Currently i am working on new open-source demo app based on tab bar layout. Will try to cover there such questions\n  In css:\n\n```\n.smart-select-page .list-block {\n  ... copy styles from .inset\n}\n```\n\nor using callbacks\n\n``` js\n$(document).on('pageInit', '.smart-select-page', function(e){\n  $(e.detail.page.container).find('.list-block').addClass('inset');\n});\n```\n  Only with custom solution (for example using Hammer.js library) or use Swiper instead of tabs\n  Look for problem on your side, maybe some problems with caching as for and fi everyone it works fine\n  I am wondering, where do you see such issue? On iOS it is still successfully produces click events\n Missed this part `..with [fastClicks = false]` Ok, will modify it\n   you may try to increase fastClicksDistanceThreshold app parameter\n Time has passed and #444 was merged  It is impossible, that is how HTML/CSS works. If you want to use dynamic navbar, it should be put outside of page itself, otherwise there is no way to work it. But you may use such layout if you'll use Fixed layout type without dinamic navbar\n > Any plans for material with dynamic navbar?\n\nNo, as there is no such feature in Material. Maybe this article will help you http://www.idangero.us/framework7/tutorials/maintain-both-ios-and-material-themes-in-single-app.html#.Vb48t5Ptmko\n\nClosing the issue\n  If you already have JSON with all data, it is better to use Virtual List in this case where you can pass it render items dynamically http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/virtual-list.html#.VOncnVOsXLg\n I guess we can close it for now? Reopen if still have a quiestions\n  Merged, thanks\n  Do you have a screenshot?\n  Yes, that is iOS issues, currently can't see the way how to fix it in Safari browser. And there is no such issue in cordova/home screen app\n Closing as seems to be iOS bug and have no way to fix it\n  You may use page callbacks to modify smart select page, for example on pagehttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs-demos/smart-select-searchbar.html try to add in console:\n\n``` js\nvar $$ = Dom7;\n$$(document).on('pageBeforeInit', '[data-page*=\"smart-select\"]', function (e) {\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n    // Add not found relation\n    $$(page.container).find('.searchbar').attr('data-searchbar-not-found', '.searchbar-not-found');\n    // Add link to add new option\n    $$(page.container).find('.page-content').append('<a href=\"#\" class=\"add-option searchbar-not-found\">Add New Option</a>');\n});\n$$(document).on('click', 'a.add-option', function(e) {\n    //do something to add option here\n});\n```\n Nothing really bad in to write this :)\n\n``` js\nselectUsersUl.append('<li><label class=\"label-checkbox item-content\"><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"' + val + '\" name=\"checkbox-1424113124395\"><div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon icon-form-checkbox\"></i></div><div class=\"item-inner\"><div class=\"item-title\">' + val + '</div></div></label></li>');\n```\n\nProbably i'll add such method, but anyway it will do the same :)\n  Yes, see that too. Seems to be FF bug with wrong flexbox layout that landed in FF 35, so it is because of new borders and item has the following content:\n\n``` jade\n.item-inner\n  .item-title\n  .item-after\n  ::after\n```\n\nIt counts ::after pseudo element which as flex item, but it has position absolute and should be ignored as in other browsers\n Hmm, setting:\n\n``` css\n.item-after {\n  margin-left: auto;\n}\n```\n\nseems to be fix it\n  Currently not sure about it, because IE is not a target browser, and having encoded or base64 background will bring pain if someone will want to change, for example, icon color\n  It is Chrome issue that landed in v 40, should be fixed in Chrome 41 or 42, nothing can do here\n  I also thought about it, but this probably should be left on app developer decision, because, for example in most of native iOS apps with cards (Google Plus, YouTube, Twitter) they are still full wide\n  You describe exactly how it behaves now, new page slide in from right, and swipe back for the left side\n This is possible in RTL layout, not in LTR http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/rtl-layout.html#.VRVQiJOsXLg\n  How do you get this error? On which element or on which device do you call it?\n Closing as it was fixed in 1.0.1 release\n  I have Node 0.10.26 and same Gulp and everything fine for me. Will investigate it\n By the way, it seems like gulp-less updated today 3.0.0, can you try to update your local dep and try it again (in package.json it is 2.0.x)\n Just checked, updated my Node to 0.12 and reinstalled global gulp to latest 3.8.11. Build works fine without issues\n  Yes, it seems to be that it is Safari/iOS issues that doesn't produce click events at all when status bar is visible, so this feature mostly for Cordova apps\n Yes, strange, but it is not related to Framework7\n  Thanks, but those examples are only to show how include icons in navbar elements, they not supposed to work and have any logic\n  Not really sure that understand what do you mean. But if you mean that taps sometimes are not working on iPad, you may try to increase `fastClicksDistanceThreshold` app parameter\n  Yes, it is a Chrome bug: \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28109129/is-this-a-chrome-css-bug\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28203658/chrome-not-properly-overriding-justify-content-for-flex-box\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/bugs-and-issues:tabs-bug-google-chrome\n  The problem is that Android doesn't have awesome \"gesturestart/change/end\" events which are in iOS. So yes, you can steal it from Photo Browser, which is by already realized on Swiper there, but it will not work on Android. If you need it on Android, you probably need to use Hammer.js which has custom cross-browser implementation of gestures\n  You may fork this repo https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Website and translate .jade files to your language. After you done with it, you may upload it somewhere and give me a link, or give me package and i can place it on main website in subfolder\n Closing for now here, if you'll have question or need my help you can email me or open issues in https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Website\n  You are welcome ;)\n  Can you give me a little guide on how to replicate it?\n @MarcGodard wow, that looks super nice! :+1: didn't see flashes in simulator, will update my Xcode and try it on real iPhone 5S and iPad 2\n Not yet, checked, was busy with another project. Will have more time tomorrow and check it\n Ok, it took a while to understand where is the problem. Seems to be it is because of opacity animation on `.page`, for example setting this CSS rule solves the problem:\n\n```\n.page {\n  opacity: initial !important;\n}\n```\n\nBut we loose opacity animation for back page. So i will need to rework a bit pages animation to leave \"new\" page opacity totally intact\n Can you try it now, totally removed box-shadow animation. Now, at least on my old iPad 2, animations perform a much much smoother and without any flashed\n @MarcGodard  can you make a video of that?\n @MarcGodard at least you may record it with another device/phone :smiley: Also, try it with todays 1.0.2 release\n Ok, i think we can close it for now\n  As it not always required, you may use this simple workaround:\n\n``` JS\nif (iPhone6Plus) {\n  $(window).on('orientationchange', function (){\n    if (window.orientation === 90 || window.orientation === -90) {\n      $('html').removeClass('with-statusbar-overlay');\n    }\n    else {\n      $('html').addClass('with-statusbar-overlay');\n    }\n  })\n}\n```\n\nYou may use cordova device plugin or check the screen size to make sure that it is iPhone 6 Plus\n  No, it is not possible, reload is for reload, you may use just .load for this case\n  It is not too sensitive. It is 44px because in most of native iOS apps it is exactly 44px. But i will make it configurable using `data-` attribute\n      Need some improvements:\n1) Parametrised and turned off by default\n2) Should be also with click on statusbar-overlay\n3) If clicked on \"center\" in navbar, need to check is there a link or not. Because there could be a link or tabs or something similar that shouldn't produce scroll top\n4) This should cover all 3 navbar layout types\n5) And finally :) Only currently active page should be scrolled top, not hidden ones\n Just found some time to implement it, should cover all usage cases\n  Merged, but also did some modifications as it didn't work always correctly\n  There is no way to create correct loop without creating duplicated slides, that is the idea of loop. But you just need to consider those duplicated slides, they have additional class and data-slide-index attribute which represents index of \"real\" slide.\n\nSwiper works in the same way, and a lot of devs using it with all possibles MVC frameworks :)\n I think we can close it for now\n  What do you see here?)\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/dist/css/framework7.min.css\n  Yes, it returns calculated CSS width, and it includes padding and border if you use `box-sizing` border-box. Otherwise you may need to use `content-box` or divide paddings\n I think we can close it for now\n  Did you try with latest dev version?\n  Merged, thanks\n  Merged, thanks\n  Merged, thanks\n  I guess this problem was solved on forum, so we can close it\n  Where do you see this? device/browser\n I guess it is Chrome with emulation of iPhone? :) It displays it wrong, look on real iPhone or in Chrome without iPhone emulation\n I think we can close it for now\n  Yes, it is fixed and still there https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/dom7-ajax.js#L207\n  Ok, will add it. But you may also use it like:\n\n```\n    myApp.onPageBack('config-page', function(page) {\n                // Some other code ..\n        var wasActive = $('.tabs.mytab-1').hasClass('active');\n        myApp.showTab('.tabs.mytab-1');\n        if (wasActive) $('.tabs.mytab-1').trigger('show');\n    }); \n```\n  No much chances :) Look at #16 \n  Need to see screenshot or mockup of what do you mean :)\n  I think the only thing could be is the call of .blur in fast click when you click out active element (https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/fast-clicks.js#L244) \n\nTry to disable fastClicks to check is the problem still there?\n\nAlso try to use it without dom lib with, if `activeInput` is HTMLElement:\n\n```\nactiveInput.blur();\nactiveInput.focus();\n```\n > For the messages, when someone clicks on the send button, I have it refocusing on the textarea and the keyboard doesn't bounce.\n\nYou may just prevent blur when you click on messagebar send button:\n\n```\n$('.messagebar .link').on('click', function (e){\n  e.preventDefault();\n  e.stopPropagation();\n  //do your send message logic here....\n});\n```\n  Merged, thanks\n  Was thinking that there could be solution without JS, but seems to be not. So i think there is a better place for it, for example in 'clicks.js' when we may prevent it once on all overlays, like:\n\n```\n$(document).on('touchstart', '.panel-overlay, .modal-overlay, .preloader-indicator-overlay, .popup-overlay, .searchbar-overlay', function (e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n  Merged, but we still need option to have contra-versa logic with new messages on top/first, i will fix now\n Add some improvements to keep option with new messages on top, also fixed animation a bit, so the animation for top messages will be from top\n Why? It is just adds another contra versa permanent scenario when you have new messages on top, old on bottom, and use of infinite scroll on bottom to load older messages\n  Merged, thanks. But i will move sarchIn var inside of `search` function\n https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/70307fe5e88e7dc882c235d4a92dce98d9259280\n  Thanks, added with much simpler way, i guess no need to use here fully separated function/methods\n  How can i replicate this issue? Can't see any errors with the same setup in kitchen sink\n  Merged, about hidden navbar when searchbar is enabled, i thought about it, but it is prertty complicated to consider all cases with all available navbar layouts (Fixed, Through and Static)\n  Hairline pixels for iOS retina devices using :after/:before pseudo selectors\nFixes #329\n  Don't sure that i understand what you mean, but all files are already in UTF-8 encoding\n Closing as no further discussion\n  Merged, thanks\n  If you mean then if you go deeper and deeper, then yes, Ajax pages are become cached while they are in history. What do you mean by \"reInit\"?\n Sure, already added in local version. But currently can't merge it until i complete another big feature. But the fix is simple:\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/5691603/3e457c86-98e1-11e4-819b-c1e86de2e132.png)\n `$(messageContent || '.messages-content')` \nis almost the same as \n`messagesContent || $('.messages-content')` \n\nbut also cover cases when passed messageContent is string CSS selector or HTML element.\n\nBy the way $($($($('.messages-content')))) is the same as just $('.messages-content'), so it is safe to wrap Dom7 result with Dom7 again ;)\n  It is mostly for internal usage, but yes, you it is safe for use. But if you need to disable swipe panels, you may use `f7.params.swipePanel = false` to disable it\n  What if you just add this to `externalLinks` app parameter?\n\n``` js\nvar f7 = new Framework7({\n  externalLinks: '.external, a[target=\"_system\"]'\n});\n```\n\nAnd F7 should skip it\n  It can't work in this case because \"transitionEnd\" event will not be fired. You may use onSlideChangeStart in this case\n Agree, will take a look what can be done. I also have in plans to replace this slider with new Swiper3 in upcoming 1.0 release\n You may just compare activeSlideIndex and previousSlideIndex properties to know the direction ;)\n i got you right :) onSlideNext/Prev in Swiper are just particular case of onSlideChangeStart with the index check inside, like in my previous answer :)\n I think we can close it, right?)\n  Of course it will not work, because you have external requests to idangero.us website\n  Merged, thanks. But probably the value should be Math.floor'ed because there are such devices with fractional pixel ratio.\n  Hi there,\nLazy loading and other improvements sounds great. But what do you think about releasing it as plugin. Because lazy loading could be not only in pages but also in modals, popovers, popups, panels. So i think it would be easier and better to do it as plugin file, where we can keep all related code in one place, instead of adding related parts through the whole lib. The same i think to do with your Ionic Keyboard implementation.\n\nSo what do you think? And we can work together on it\n It is ok about lazy loading. I'll start to integrate it into F7 based on your implementation, it requires for  some tweaks.\nI also have in plans to do Android-look plugin. But that is right after 1.0 release of F7, there is still a lot of work here.\n\nAbout MVC base, i was thinking about it and had some tries, but then i came to conclusion that there is no much sense to \"reinvent wheel\" and it is better to do few plugins that make it compatible with well known MVC libs like Angular, Backbone, Ember, etc.\n Ok, just added and pushed Lazy loader with appropriate demo in kitchen sink. You can check the code, i've made some improvements:\n- Function `isElementInViewport` didn't consider the case when image could be larger than viewport\n- Added `threshold` option\n- Added option to load images sequential to prevent unnecessary loading of images during fast scroll\n- Added fade-in animation by adding \"lazy-fadeIn\" class to image/block with bg\n- Added placeholder image option so image may have size until it loaded\n  These two callbacks onAjaxStart/End are only for internal XHR requests, you may just use this, like in kitchen sink:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('ajaxStart', function () {\n    myApp.showIndicator();\n});\n$$(document).on('ajaxComplete', function () {\n    myApp.hideIndicator();\n});\n```\n Look for problem on your side or provide a link so i can take a look. It works for everyone\n Then i can't say much. Try to look for problem, as it does work in kitchen sink and for everyone else\n Closing for now, if you still have it issue, provide a link or more code examples\n  Right, none of these are possible, will add it\n Now it is possible with both ways\n  Everything is fine for me, it is actually shouldn't be related to os and device\n  No, there is no such opportunity by default, but you can add it manually using page callback, for example:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('pageInit', '.page[data-page*=\"smart-select-\"]', function (e){\n  var pageContainer = $$(e.detail.page.container);\n  pageContainer.find('.page-content').append('<a href=\"#\" class=\"button back\">Ok</a>');\n})\n```\n Closing as no further discussion\n  You are right, there is no such callback/event. Will add it\n  Do you mean this switch?\n![switch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/5592065/ff0bba56-91c1-11e4-85de-e8c5f564d7fe.png)\n\nWorks fine for me on Android 4.0+\n\nThe only problem could be with Checkboxes and Radios, but this related to Android's bad support of SVG background images\n  Merged, thanks\n  Closing as no further response\n  Just back from vacation, will check your improvements during a week\n  Yes, i had looked. And as @johnjamesjacoby mentioned, i am trying to look for a better approach. The biggest problem of such approach is the later custom customisation of such borders. I am sure that there will be a lot of troubles and questions from dev.\n\nI haven't real iPhone 6 Plus device, so i ask you to check it on real device. From what i have tried in simulator:\n- setting CSS border-width to 0.7px gives \"stable\" (not buggy) 2 physical-pixels border width (instead of 3px like with 1px border). This is already not bad\n- setting CSS border-width to 0.67px gives 1 physical-pixels border width. But for some reason, it becomes buggy and such borders disappear during scrolling. And i don't know, maybe it is just a simulator bug. So if it is fine on real iPhone 6 Plus then it could be a \"holy grail\" solution :)\n @MarcGodard i saw your infinite scroll on top. I think this is could be useful, so i will add that code to F7\n @johnjamesjacoby are you sure that you provided correct link to commit? It is about Lazy loading\n @johnjamesjacoby @MarcGodard Did you have a chance to check my proposed solution with `0.7px` and `0.67px` borders on iPhone 6 Plus?\n Just merged #350 based on @MarcGodard pseudo selectors solution\n  Hi, thanks. But this media list should be an option. I'll add this feature in next release\n  It should be mainView.router.back(), also check the forum, there were a lot of solutions for this\n [Look here](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/?android back button)\n\nThe only difference is that you need to use mainView.router.back() instead of mainView.goBack()\n  Thanks, fixed\n  Hmm, you are right. I was sure that iOS should do that by default. Will check it, but meanwhile you can use this JS snippet anywhere in your app's js:\n\n```\n$(document).on('click', function(e){\n  if (document.activeElement && document.activeElement !== e.target) document.activeElement.blur()\n});\n```\n What about contributing. Your addon could be useful for users. I think the better way to bring it to users will be creating it as Framework7 drop-in plugin  using plugins api (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/plugins-api.html). \nOr, if there is not much of code there, you can send PR to main F7 lib\n I haven't real iPhone 6 Plus device, but in simulator, yes, they look too thin, wasn't sure that the same issue is on real device. Anyway, for iPhone 6 Plus border should be set to 0.7px for this case\n Using Transforms/Backgrounds technic is not good to get fraction pixel borders, because it is not straightforward for custom styling and could bring just more problems\n That is true, but it still should be possible with float border values. I'll try to dig it more deeply when i get iPhone 6 Plus device\n Yes, you can also do that just by setting viewport meta tag \n\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=0.5, minimum-scale=0.5, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui\">\n```\n\nand make everything twice bigger. But such approach with scaling has another huge issue, performance will be also slower, especially on iPads ;)\n Ok, thanks. I'll check it when i back from vacation after 2 weeks\n  Could you please try it with just released 0.9.9? If issue is still there, then it would be good to see full layout that produces it\n Ok, as i see it is something wrong with Safari. You can check that in Chrome everything is fine, and i guess this fix could break it in other browsers. For some reason $$('.messages-content').height() and $$('.messages-content').outerHeight() are the same in Safari, but should be different. Will check it a bit more closer on tomorrow\n Merged, thanks\n  Yeah, thanks, i need to reconsider this part as it was made with particular support of old browser. I guess, the same should be done for `.height`?\n  Can you tell me part of your code with fix? I can't see any changes in your PR :)\n Ok, can you give me example on how can i replicate this issue in current 0.9.8 release?\n Thanks, will try to find a fix tomorrow\n Seems to be fixed now\n  Do you see it in browser or in phonegap app?\n  It was discussed many times, it is iOS behavior and can't be fixed in browser/webview in iOS 8+ with pure CSS solution. But if you use it in PhoneGap there is a special parameter `disallowOverscoll` (or similar) that allows to disable it\n I think we can close it\n  To scroll it to top, you may just do `$$('.messages-content').scrollTop(0)`. Also there is an option to layout new messages on top instead of bottom by adding `new-messages-first` class to `.messages` div as explained here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/messages.html\n  Why it is not working? That is the only and correct way: `<input type=\"checkbox\" checked>`. If this doesn't work for you then problem is somewhere else, would be good to see live example or code sample\n No problems\n  Do you have any example of what you have tried? There shouldn't be much problems with it. I saw a lot of google maps in F7\n  So if i get you right, to update smart select, you need to manually update its `<select>` options and then call `app.initSmartSelects(pageContainer)`, where `pageContainer` is the parent .page div of this smart select. This method will update visible selected values in \"item-after\"\n  Can you give a link to example? Or provide JS part of this code?\n And the `.disconnect-button` is inside of panel-right?\n Ok, when you remove and rewrite panel content the disconnect button which you assing event is gone. You need to add this click handler every time after you overwrite panel content, or you may just use live event:\n\nChange this\n\n```\n$$('.disconnect-button').on('click', function () {\n```\n\nto this\n\n```\n$$('.panel-right').on('click', '.disconnect-button', function () {\n```\n  Right, it can't. But it could be done using vanilla js in easy way:\n\n```\nvar div = document.createElement('div'); // create temporary div element\ndiv.innerHTML = ''<div class=\"container\"></div>''; //add there your html\nvar $container = Dom7(div).children('.container'); //and get it using traversing\n```\n  Yes, just make sure that wrapped elements has the same css styles.\n\nP.S. why?)\n I see, in this case, sorry, it is not currently possible. As a solution you may try to change styles for overlays and modals to make them appear on top and in frame of wrapper div\n  They should be a direct child of `<body>`, you probably put them somewhere inside\n  Are you sure? Just did \"bower install\" and got version from November 6. That is probably your bower local cache\n  @GuillaumeBiton That is a not a good way. Because you overwrite not only the whole Navbar but also `.pages` div which is fundamental for View routing. So you can do such thing only once and only before you init main View, otherwise many things could be broken. \n\nAlso if you change some of navbar elements dynamically you need to use `.sizeNavbars` method (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar.html#related-app-and-view-methods) that will set correct position for navbar elements\n Keep only page content in template:\n\n```\nscript(type='text/template7', id='homeTemplate')\n  .page-content\n    ...\n```\n\nAnd JS:\n\n```\nfunction updateHome() {\n    $$('.view.view-main .navbar-inner .center').text(\"myTitle\");\n    $$('.view.view-main .page[data-page=\"index\"]').html(T7.templates.homeTemplate(...));\n    app.sizeNavbars('.view-main'); //update navbar\n}\n```\n  Ok, will check it on a days\n Ok, as i see it doesn't work only in IE, in all other browsers it works properly. Can you try to use this polyfil https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/parapara/master/editor/lib/js/svgClassList.js ? I am not sure about including a lot of conditions for a non-target platform\n  Yeah, but i guess in your case you haven't pages without nav bar, right? So this issue shouldn't be there. Do you have a live link with problem so i can take a look?\n Ok, i'll check it\n This should be already fixed in 0.9.9\n  Let's look at src code together:) Here is this part:\n\n```\n    // Handle XHR\n    xhr.onload = function (e) {\n        if (xhr.status === 200 || xhr.status === 0) {\n            $(document).trigger('ajaxSuccess', {xhr: xhr});\n            if (options.success) {\n                var responseData = xhr.responseText;\n\n                if (options.dataType === 'json') responseData = JSON.parse(responseData);\n                options.success(responseData, xhr.status, xhr);\n            }\n        }\n        if (options.statusCode) {\n            if (options.statusCode[xhr.status]) options.statusCode[xhr.status](xhr);\n        }\n        if (options.complete) {\n            options.complete(xhr);\n        }\n        $(document).trigger('ajaxComplete', {xhr: xhr});\n    };\n\n    xhr.onerror = function (e) {\n        $(document).trigger('ajaxError', {xhr: xhr});\n        if (options.error) options.error(xhr);\n    };\n\n    // Ajax start callback\n    if (options.start) options.start(xhr);\n\n    // Send XHR\n    $(document).trigger('ajaxStart', {xhr: xhr});\n    xhr.send(postData);\n\n    // Return XHR object\n    return xhr;\n```\n - `complete` callback executed each time Ajax request loaded. \n- `success` callback executed when Ajax request loaded and loaded with status 200 or 0\n- `error` callback executed when Ajax request fails for some reason\n\nSo probably 401 is not error in mean of Ajax request, and in your `complete` callback you may just check xhr status using `xhr.status`\n\nDid i got it correct?\n Now it is not, and i guess that logically it shouldn't. So if there is an error, Ajax request can not be completed\n  What about super simple custom code for that?\n\n```\nvar xhr = $.ajax(....);\nsetTimeout(function(){\n  xhr.abort();\n}, 10000);\n```\n  Don't really understand what do you mean by conflict. What is OS version, what is browsers? Also would be good to see screen captured video of this issue\n Sorry, i still don't get it. What is \"Riccarton phenomenon\"? Can you try to capture video of problem?\n Yeah, i got it, but i need more information on how can i replicate the issue to find a solution\n Closing for now\n  There is no way to emulate spacebar keyboard button. But if you use it in Phonegap you may use Cordova Keyboard plugin, it allows to change a bit behavior of keyboard\n  Will think about adding variable for that\n minified versions shouldn't be in build/ as it is for developing of F7 itself. I'll try to configure it so it points to full versions in build/\n  Why it is not available? It is still there. You may use navigation inside of popup, but to make it work you need to initialize View in this Popup\n Sorry, there is no way to prevent Safari default swipe back to switch between history. And of course it is mostly made for apps, not for website\n  Thanks\n  Do you also have this error on Kitchen Sink demo?\n Ok, there is no content at all when you open it second time or it is there but invisible?\n @shaulhadar just checked on Android 4.4.2 device and everything looks fine on online kitchen sink demo. Could you tell me your exact OS and browser version? And by the way do you use it in Panel or in usual View?\n  Do you have a link with example so i can take a look?\n  Right, because 0.9.8 has reworked hide/show navbars/toolbars API which is not related to View anymore like before and be used on any navbar/toolbar/tabbar. \n\nAnd this is correct fix. The same fix is used in current Kitchen Sink\n  Just fixed it, redownload 0.9.8, should be ok now\n  There is a flag: `myApp.allowSwipeout`. In your case (in popup and in panel) opened swipe out element became hidden before it was closed, so this flag is still `false` and it doesn't allow you to open other element. You may use something like:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('open', '.popup, .panel', function () {\n  myApp.allowSwipeout = true;\n});\n```\n  Merged, thanks. But it is actually don't required because any code that you write just after `app.slider(...)` will do the same job ;)\n  No, status bar will not and shouldn't be removed. If you need to show/hide status bar you may add/remove \"with-statusbar-overlay\" on html within pageInit callback\n  Update your F7, it was already fixed in 0.9.7 more than month ago ;)\n  First of all, i see you have `router:false` - this disable ajax request and page loading\n  Didn't think in this mean, but will take a look what is possible to do here\n Sure, feel free to share your code modifications and i'll add them\n  No, it is still here and available\n  Not sure that i understand what do you mean. Can you explain it more detailed?\n You may use JS api or add \"tab-link\" class and required href attribute to related link http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/tabs.html#show-tab-using-javascript\n  The same as #112\n  This shouldn't be here, it is a different fast clicks library\n  That is because multiline flex box layout is not well supported on Androids < 4.4\n Sorry, F7 doesn't mean to be compatible with old Androids. If you need the grid that works for old androids, just look for any CSS grid library, there are a lot of them https://www.google.ru/webhp?q=css+grid#newwindow=1&q=css+grid\n  It shouldn't be there, in css. Just remained from old styles. Now it should be used as:\n\n```\n<span class=\"badge bg-red\">4</span>\n```\n Where did you find it on website?\n fixed\n  Tabs have events, so you may leave other tabs blank and load content there when tabs shown:\n\n```\n$$('.tab').on('show', function(){\n  //load content to tab\n})\n```\n Then you just need for some simple check if this API was already requested on tab show, and don't load it again in this case\n  Sure, docs website is here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Website. So feel free to send pull request to this repo\n  Should work fine, works for me and for others fine ;) Make sure that you don't forget to clean cache before checking new 0.9.7 release\n @shaulhadar can you give me a link to your app so i can take a look?\n You are using old version that doesn't have scroll toolbars, update it to 0.9.7\n  But what is wrong with this code snippet? It looks like usual long poling xhr\n  Doesn't it work by default? Can you give me a screenshot of what you got?\n  Look at Syntax highlighting here https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n Yes, animated tabs are made a bit similar to Slider, so the each tab has the same 100% height. So to make scrolling works you may just wrap tab's content with some div like:\n\n```\n<div class=\"tab\">\n  <div class=\"tab-content\">...</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nAnd add this in CSS:\n\n```\n.tab-content {\n  overflow:auto;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n```\n  Already fixed in dev version\n And fixed in 0.9.8\n  Merged, but it also should be added to actionsPopoverTemplate template\n  My bad, thanks, will fix it\n Fixed\n  Good to know OS version/device. Because as i see on kitchen sink everything is fine\n Still not sure what you mean. Maybe you also need to add:\n\n```\n<div style=\"height: 2000px; overflow-y: scroll; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch\">\n..\n</div>\n```\n Closing as seems to not actual\n  Merged, thanks\n  Thanks\n  That is how JS works, you need to do `myApp.pullToRefreshTrigger(ptrContent)` AFTER you adding \"refresh\" listener, in your code it is for some reason before\n  Thanks, fixed :)\n Damned :)\n @boynet fixed also)\n  Yes, this is restriction, because new version allows load inline pages by same URLs, so \"tab-link\" class should be removed from link to make it work like usual link to load smth\n You can easily use just \"link\" class in this case, instead of \"tab-link\". It will preserve styling\n For me they look absolutely the same if both are used in \"tabbar\". Maybe some small problem with tabbar-label. Just fixed it with last commit\n  Thanks, fixed\n  This check is only to disallow to load the same active page twice. What is JS error do you have, what console says?\n Or tell me how to replicate this issue?\n Thanks George, seems to be fixed now\n  Merged, thank!\n  Sure, will add it. For future issues about T7 it is better to submit them in appropriate repo at https://github.com/nolimits4web/Template7 ;)\n Already fixed it in Template7 repo, so will be in F7 with next update\n Fixed in 0.9.7\n  Thanks for the tip, i've realized it a little bit diffrent by adding additional class to PTR when there is no navbar from JavaScript. About second problem when scrollbar starts not from top, yes it is still there. currently don't see a good way to fix it to save ability to use native scrolling. Because the fix i see requires totally different layout structure. Maybe we can live with it for now, i guess there are not much use cases with PTR and without navbars, right?\n How did you get native navbar in app, you used some of Cordova plugins?\n  They works fine in iOS 6. Just try to refresh browser, because in latest 0.9.6 their layout complitely different, probably cached old css\n  Yes, this is a new caching behavior, look here for solution http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/bugs-and-issues:preloaded-pages-empty-after\n  This is in plans, will be available in next release or release after\n  \u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 pushState?\n \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0435 \u0441 uniqueHistory, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e History API \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u044d\u0439\u0442\u044b. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0449\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438\n \u0422\u0430\u043c \u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0448\u0438\u0431\u043a\u0430, \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c `if (view.history.indexOf(url) >= 0)`, \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\n  Ok, but this is not the issue, right? I guess it breaks nothing, and doesn't depend on anything, right?)\n Such thing was actual in times of IE 8\n But that the problem of IDE/jshint mostly which should/could/may be configured using .jshintrtc https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/.jshintrc\n Anyway, will remove those commas to make your IDE breathe better ;)\n  Right, thanks)\n  The same as #246 \n  Need to ask some Meteor dev, i am not familiar with it :)\n I interested to make them work together. Can you give some kind of step-by-step actions of meteor router, so what it is doing on page load, and where you have conflicts with F7 or where you need some additional F7 callbacks. I am currently working on F7's router restructuring so we may try to bring it in next release\n Also i just note this in stack overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/a/26083997/1923913). I don't know is it related?\n @maytis i guess yes, there shouldn't be much problems, look here for example https://github.com/kaissaroj/newshunt\n  Hi, this check is correct. This check returns true if app is running full screen, in this case it requires status bar overlay. If you want to force to disable it, you may add statusbarOverlay:false app's parameter on intialization\n Width and height of window not always equal to width and height of screen, these are different things. Are you sure that this is a F7's status bar? Maybe it is phonegap? Did you enabled it to full screen? \n You may also check it in Safari dev tools, to see what is that\n Try to install this plugin https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar, it will give you more control over this\n Just checked in Xcode on iOS 7 and iOS 8, everything detects correctly. Just need to be sure that you've set correct related settings in XCode.\nAnd this plugin is not just about hiding status bar, there is an important method _StatusBar.overlaysWebView_ that define its behavior\n  My bad, that is because onSlideChangeStart meaning was changed in 0.9.6 in Slider component. Will fix it\n  You may also need to enable pushState\n What exactly you asking to include in F7 ? :)\n The problem is that this code (with deviceready and backbutton) only workable in PhoneGap and only in Android. But as i see it is just few lines of code, so will try to add it to the core\n @ZanderBrown Vladi sometimes likes to keep tickets open as a \"todo\".\r\n\r\nI think he knows best if this can be closed or not.  Not possible now, that will be in next update. As an option, you may use .loadContent to load content from templates or passed strings without Ajax\n I think we can close it for now, as it is already possible in recently released 0.9.7. Docs are also updated\n  That is on 0.9.9 road map\n By the way, here is a great Split View implementation with F7 - https://github.com/GuillaumeBiton/HackerNews7\n  Alignment shouldn't be done with JS, probably CSS should enough, could you show screenshot of what you have and try to achieve?\n Ok, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0431\u0430\u0433, \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u044b \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\n \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439\n  Currently, there is no plans for IE support, because, unfortunately, it is pretty buggy and has pretty bad support of most used here HTML 5 features, including custom touch events implementation\n  Merged, thanks\n  Right, currently there is support no such custom swipe methods/events. But will be a bit later. For now, you may use this small lib http://hammerjs.github.io/ that exactly what you want.\nP.S. \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432-\u043d\u0430-\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0443? :)\n Any progress on this? @iamsudharshan could you put together a plugin or PR? No it's not currently available   Can't replicate this issue, works fine for me, and this part was intact in 0.9.6\n @johnjamesjacoby there was a fix for this with setting overflow on overlay, but it doesn't work anymore in iOS 8\n  But it works for you in Kitchen Sink http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/? It is 0.9.6 \n Maybe some conflict in your app, do you see any errors in console?\n So you have disabled both swipeBackPage and preloadPreviousPage?\n Ok, the last question, the page where you have smart select link is Ajax page or content page (loaded with .loadContent)?\n Just tried few time in different situations and it works fine for me. I don't understand what happens. Because \"going back\" from smart select's page works in the same way as from usual page, so if you don't modify View's history manually it should be ok. \n\nYou can even check that it is fine in Kitchen Sink, just open http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/ in browser and type in JS console:\n\n```\nmainView.params.swipeBackPage = false;\nmainView.params.preloadPreviousPage = false;\n```\n\nAnd go to Form -&gt; Smart Select, you will see that everything fine\n Ohh, i've understood you wrong, i thought you can't go back to previous page from Smart Select page. Now i see what you mean :) Will fix it\n  Just refresh browser's cache:) It was just updated with new 0.9.6 Release, it has new swipeout syntax\n  Your thoughts are a bit complicated. That is right, View is a pretty complex thing, but it is also a usual `<div>`. \nSo you may just:\n\n```\n$$('.some-view').show();\n$$('.another-view').hide();\n```\n\nBefore app init. \n\nThe same in iPhone, think about it like about usual `<div>`, so you may hide/show it using JS, or with CSS (media queries), anything you like\n  I changed it intentionally to keep selector not too strict, it works fine on defaults and it still easy to rewrite it with custom styles if required:\n![icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/4260466/04d22a5e-3b3e-11e4-8753-a1a26e366f99.png)\n Or did i missed something?\n That is because \"i.icon.icon-camera\" selector is more strict (or equal) than \".tabbar i.icon\", and it is lower in code. There is no bulletproof rule here. You may just add to your app's css:\n\n```\ni.icon.icon-camera {\n  height: 30px;\n}\n```\n  That is a bit wrong approach: \n- \"tabbar\" class should be only on tab bar, otherwise you can have unexpected results when \"tabbar\" is also on views, view or page\n- this also should be add only for tab bar with labels, because usual tab bar (with icons only) has the same 44px\n\nSo it should be something like \"with-tabbar-labels\" class (maybe with better name). Or if we put tab bar before page-content, we can just use the following selector:\n\n```\n.tabbar-labels + .page-content {\n  padding-bottom: 50px;\n}\n```\n Just fixed it with bd08923153584e82b6f93e7c1af89ce528c3fe70 by adding tabbar-labels-fixed/through classes that may be used instead (or together) of toolbar-fixed/through\n  Yes, you can, you need to enable domCache app parameter http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/init-app.html\n\nAnd please, use Forum for questions\n  No, there is a button click callbacks for that where you may do .loadPage method to load page. Use Forum for questions\n  You also need to add \"hidden-navbar\" class to its parent View, and \"hidden-toolbar\" for toolbar/tabbar\n > Is there any way to load pages (HTML) for tabbar links? Currently if I place href=\"somefile.html\" it slides it from right instead of switching page without an effect like default tabbar behavior.\n\nRight, that is because you do load a page, not switch tabs. You may use \"no-animation\" class on link to load it without sliding animation http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/linking-pages.html#load-pages---go-back-with-out-animation\n same as in previous post:\n\n```\n<div class=\"navbar navbar-hidden\">\n\n<div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page no-navbar\">\n```\n  Right, thanks\n  @ourcd look here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/views.html#access-to-view's-instance-with-other-ways\n\nSo you can access it like $$('.view.active')[0].f7View:\n\n```\n$$('.tab.active')[0].f7View.loadPage('...')\n```\n  Interesting, will take a look\n Fixed now in dev\n  You may just omit data-search-list and data-search-in attributes and implement your own search\n  No support for so old Android, 4.0 + only, and better on 4.4\n  I guess the problem is that pageInit occurs before new script loaded, so you may just use \"onload\" attribute/event on added script tag, no?\n @GuillaumeBiton  could you share a part of plugin's code so i can take a look what you are trying?\n Ok, you probably should modify load function to something like that:\n\n```\nvar load = function (name) {\n        var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n        script.onload = function () {\n            if(app.plugins[name]) {\n                app.plugins[name](app, app.params[name]);\n            }\n        };\n        script.src = name + \".js\";\n        script.id = name;\n        document.body.appendChild(script);\n    };\n```\n\nand remove pageBeforeAnimation callback\n Oh, you are trying to load F7's plugins with this plugin :) I thought you mean some other JS scripts\n Maybe you can call it here only in lazy plugin because as i see it doesn't use pageInit hook, so just:\n\n```\nvar load = function (name, page) {\n        var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n        script.onload = function () {\n            if(app.plugins[name]) {\n                app.plugins[name](app, app.params[name]);\n                app.pluginHook('pageInit', page);\n            }\n        };\n        script.src = name + \".js\";\n        script.id = name;\n        document.body.appendChild(script);\n    };\n```\n Ok, the final try:)\n\n```\nvar load = function (name, page) {\n        var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n        script.onload = function () {\n            if(app.plugins[name]) {\n                var _plugin = app.plugins[name](app, app.params[name]);\n                _plugin.hooks.pageInit(page);\n            }\n        };\n        script.src = name + \".js\";\n        script.id = name;\n        document.body.appendChild(script);\n    };\n```\n  Fixed now in dev. But i think it is not very good usage case when you may have multiple popups opened. Reconsider it in favour of using initialized view in popup where you can just load another page inside of popup\n  No, it is iOS behavior, no chances to control it in webapp. Only in phonegap with Keyboard plugin\n  Can you show your panel's HTML structure?\n Ok, didn't check yet, but could you try to use view/page layout there like:\n\n```\n.panel\n  .view\n    .pages\n      .page\n        .page-content.pull-to-refresh-content \n          ...\n```\n\nYou may not initialise this View, but such structure provides required overflow context, so this could help. And in this case you will not need to use `myApp.initPullToRefresh( $$( '.panel-left' ) );`\n That is iOS 8 right?\n On iOS 7 it is ok, I already have found fix for iOS 8 but it is a bit hacky and don't really like it, but anyway, if I will not find something better it will be in next update\n Hmm, just checked, on iOS 8 in panel and in the page-content it works fine for me, it doesn't move whole app down. Can you capture a video of what you mean? Maybe we are talking about different things\n I see now, thanks, will fix it tomorrow\n Hmm, what is your iOS 8 version? Just checked on latest iOS 8 GM Seed release, also in simulator and it works fine\n Here is a video, you can also see there required HTML structure: https://www.dropbox.com/s/emb3mg4jd0xorhh/ptr-in-panel.mp4?dl=0\n Hmm, looks the same. Do you use any other JS components/plugins there?\n By the way i see in data attributes `{snip}`. Do you use some templating there, or modify content with JS?\n This issue is last thing that holds me from new 0.9.6 release :) Maybe you can send it to me privately so i can look?\n I see, as a workaround you may use this instead:\n\n```\n.panel .page-content {\n  padding-top: 44px;\n  margin-top: -44px;\n  box-sizing: content-box;\n}\n```\n  Can't replicate issue, link with example or Fiddle would be helpful\n  Because IE doesn't support CSS pointer-events and there is no plans for IE support in framework. But you can fix it by adding this in CSS:\n\n```\n.searchbar-overlay {\n  display:none;\n}\n.searchbar-overlay.searchbar-overlay-active {\n  display:block;\n}\n```\n  Already in dev\n  Fixed for all icons in dev\n  It is a Chrome issue http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=chrome+37\n  Hmm, i missed one event in docs. There also should be called .updateClasses which updates active classes\n I will add one method, like just .update() that will include these 3 ones :)\n Already in dev version\n  Can't replicate it. Can you give a link so i can take a look?\n Which pageEvent/Callback do you use?\n Sorry, but how do you retrieve \"id\" then?\n Closing, as fixed a while ago\n  They are not yet ready, still in progress. And right, there will no be backwards compatibility \n By the way, what do you mean with `Text is not centered through-out the entire animation` ?\n Should be much much better now with new additional overswipes feature\n Released in 0.9.6\n  Thanks, it is fixed now. That was mostly browser rendering issue, so this https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/7047d0c98703962d28a0cc8cc7823f8c077a5eed fixed it even without calling .slideNext method\n  Yes, I know about it, and it will be in next release. By the way, this is the first you may read on this page http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/action-sheet.html (in red box) :) But the problem is that popover should be also converted to action sheet on iPhone, and this is the problem because popover could contain anything inside. So i guess I will add additional method, something like .actionsPopover, where app will decide what to show depending on screen size\n Yes, there is an error, will push fix with new update now\n Fixed and implemented in 0.9.6\n  Please, use Forum (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/) for question, it is not F7 issue. And you can do it like:\n\n```\n$$('input[name=\"sex\"][value=\"male\"]').prop('checked', true');\n```\n  Because Android less than 4.4 doesn't support background-size with SVG images. You can replace it with required png icon\n  That is by desing, if you click \"back\" than you should go back, and user expect to get previous page, not something else, right? Otherwise, if you want to replace/reload back page, there are few solutions, for example #188, #116. And look at forum http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/, there were a lot  of same questions there\n As solution you may add custom classes for required pages, and rewrite animation for them in CSS\n  Yep, will fix it\n  It is impossible, you just do something wrong, probably there is no \"#logintip\" element in your document. \n Then you should do your ajax request also within onPageAfterAnimation callback, when this element is on the page\n Can't say anything about it. Looks like problem on your side. Live example would be good so i can take a look\n  You can add link directly in HTML:\n\n```\nmyApp.addNotification({\n        title: 'Framework7',\n        message: 'This is a simple <a href=\"#\">notification</a> message with title and message'\n    });\n```\n\nOr like @SniperGER use `onClick` callback.\n\n> and on android the close button not show.\n\nAnd will not. Android doesn't support SVG backgrounds well. You can change it to custom png image\n  Hi, i appreciate your efforts, but it was removed intentionally. First of all, it seems like you've dropped its Rails gem support/updates. Secondary, you have to understand that there shouldn't be backend-platform specific code in this repo, i mean at least for only one specific server language. Otherwise it looks like we ignore other languages. So the better place for it will be the different repo\n  Only with using any third-party slider plugin. Default HTML range input (which is in current implementation) doesn't support dual range\n You can try this http://refreshless.com/nouislider/ for example\n If you do totally custom JS slider implementation, that you could be used only if required, then yes, i will accept it, but not a third-party plugin\n  ```\n$$('.list-block input:checked').val()\n```\n  Make sure that you use latest 0.9.5 version\n @aydin1918 then it seems like you are trying to access it before it was loaded\n  Yes, this was by design to keep modal elements with default styles to match system's styles. But if you need to change its styles, you can easily do it in css with few rules\n  Yes, this was discussed many times. It is Android/iOS predefined behavior. Nothing can do here. But if you use it in PhoneGap, then you may use this plugin to prevent it https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/keyboard\n  Great, thanks, will add it. I am also was looking for sultion\n  There is no such thing as jumping to other View. If you want to load page in other View in JS, you can do:\n\n```\nanotherView.loadPage('somepage.html');\n```\n There is no such thing as \"jump\". If you want to hide/show views, just use Dom7's/jQuery's .hide()/show() method on selected View's HTML element\n Closing as no further discussion\n  Hmm, you are right. They trigger now in the begin/end of any transition. Will fix it\n  Right, it doesn't trigger init event again, because the previous page is always sit in dom to keep ability of doing swipe back. So there are few approaches here:\n\n```\n//For example you have navigation  Page1 -> Page2 -> Page3. \n//And when you back from Page3 to Page2 yo need to refresh Page2.\nmyApp.onPageBeforeAnimation('page2', function (page){\n  //right before animation from page3 to page2\n  if (page.from === 'left') {\n    //update here page2\n  }\n});\n```\n Other approach is you can remove Page 2 from the dom after page3 becomes visible:\n\n```\nmyApp.onPageAfterAnimation('page3', function (page){\n  //Page 3 arrives, we may remove Page 2 from dom and it will \n  //be reloaded when you click on back link\n  $$('.page-on-left').remove();\n})\n```\n\nYou also need to add page2's url to ignoreCache array, so it should be reloaded with updated data with each request\n Already possible in 0.9.6 by adding `data-forceUrl=\"true\"` attribute to back link or using goBack with forceUrl/ignoreCache options\n  That is ok, but could you change:\n\n```\nif (sliding.hasClass('center') && oldNavbarInner.find('.left .back .icon').length > 0 && !oldNavbarInner.find('.left .icon-only').length) {\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nif (sliding.hasClass('center') && oldNavbarInner.find('.left .back .icon ~ span').length > 0) {\n```\n\nand i will merge it.\n\nIt is because we actually looking for span. And this will also prevent case when we have just icon but haven't \"icon-only\" class\n Merged, thanks\n  And it shouldn't, at leat in current implementation. F7 always keeps previous page in dom so user can always do swipe back gesture\n First of all you may disable swipeback on index page:\n\n```\n<div class=\"page no-swipeback\" data-page=\"index\">...\n```\n\nAnd you may remove register page manually and clear view history:\n\n```\nmyApp.onPageAfterAnimation('index', function(){\n  $$('.page-on-left').remove();\n  mainView.history = ['index.html']; \n})\n```\n But anyway, there is a Login Screen overlay component that should be used to prevent such issues\n You can put the View inside of Login Screen element, initialize it, and you should be able to load Register page inside of Login Screen as usual pages\n As as i said you need to put the View's structure there: .view>.pages>.page, etc\n  Sorry, but this method is not for this and it shouldn't clear search bar text field. If you need to clear it you may just do this:\n\n```\n$$('.searchbar input').val('');\n```\n ```\n$('a.searchbar-clear').trigger('click');\n// will emulate click on on this link\n```\n Ok, what is wrong with this??? `$$('.searchbar input').val('');` It is used when you click on clear button\n Ok, then like this: `$$('.searchbar input').val('').trigger('change')`\n $('.searchbar-overlay').removeClass('searchbar-overlay-active')\n Try to do that after destroySearchbar\n Sorry, these are basics. This mean that you do something wrong. Try to use web inspector and look there what and why this happens\n  That is native Android window. Framework7 doesn't related to this issue\n I am talking about that this popup window doesn't related to F7, it is Android's system window. And i am not sure that \"hidden\" attribute is applicable here at all\n  Please provide Android version, browser, and screenshot will be helpful\n Hmm, can you also show your buttons html?\n It seems like they are cropped in your app, and i just checked on Android 4.2 and buttons looks fine. Try to set fixed size on buttons-row, like:\n\n```\n<div class=\"buttons-row\" style=\"width:120px\">\n```\n  As you may see your PR is failed Travic CI test. Where you have:\n\n```\ncontainer = $(this);\n```\n\nChange to:\n\n```\n/*jshint validthis:true */\ncontainer = $(this);\n```\n Thanks!\n  Wait, that is not a good idea to use .each here. To make it work with multiple PTR's, it should just enough to redefine container inside of handleTouchStart:\n\n```\nhandleTouchStart(e) {\n  ...\n  container = $(this);\n}\n```\n\nTry it. Because all other methods supports multiple dom elements including \".on\" for adding event listeners\n Sure, send it\n  Yes, they should be reworked, at least swipeouts, but I haven't ios 8 on real device, so I can't even see it :) Maybe you can capture video of this new swipeouts?\n Looks very cool, so of course, let me know when it will be ready. By the way, I think you should keep such ios 8-like swipeouts as default behavior\n By the way, how you create such nice and smooth gifs?:)\n Nice, didn't even thought that it is possible to open .mov in PhotoShop )) Thanks will try it\n @SniperGER that close button which becomes full size on over swipe, on iOS 8 this works in the same way, or it is just your idea?\n Such swipeouts are already in dev version.\n > These are now in 0.9.6.\n\nSwipeouts yes, but the popups, which i am not sure about. Because it requires transition/transform on View/Views, which really slows down app performance\n @SniperGER CSS transitions are fast, but with complex DOM layout, anyway, it becomes very slow.\nAbout swipeouts, that will not be simple, because their behavior and layout is totally different now. As only possible solution i see to disable swipeouts at all with related app option and grab code from previous F7, everything from swipeout.js\n @MarcGodard not sure what do you mean. Can you explain it more detailed? Or some example\n I think we may close it\n  If you did everything correct it can't just fails, it works on any Views, just make sure that you have initialize it and don't try to load the same URL\n Please refer to docs (or getting started guide, or split view example app) and to the basic View HTML structure, it will not work like that. Each View should have the following structure to load pages:\n\n```\n.view.view-left\n  .pages\n    .page(data-page=\"menu\")\n      ..default menu page content\n.view.view-main\n  .pages\n    .page(data-page=\"main\") \n      ..default main page content\n```\n\nAlso look at the required ajax loaded file structure, your structure is also wrong, it should contain `<div class=\"page\">...</div>` element\n Ok, right, now i see where issue is. F7 has a flag that doesn't allow to load page during another page animation/loading. Will rework it to make this flag related to View instead of entire app\n  Wow, thanks for pointing that. Because it is not always required, i guess we can leave it to developer, Let's keep it opened for a while, should be useful for others who looking for this solution\n @johnjamesjacoby didn't test it, but problem could be in `window.navigator.standalone`. Try to check F7's `app.device.webView` instead\n @trafnar yes, this is iOS bug and, unfortunately, iOS 8 home screen apps web view has a lot more of nasty bugs\n\nP.S. Your Flinto service looks really great, amazing job!)\n I think we may close it\n  Yep, this method is exactly for this\n  Hi, it is similar but not fully. The loop option is not presented here, probably will add it later, it just requires a lot of code. But as for now, you may use Swiper instead of built in slider\n  Hi Martijn,\nCan't see such issue. What is your OS, is it with mouse or touch?\n Agh, i see now what you mean. Will fix it in next update\n  It works fine. You need to escape such strings in LESS:\n\n```\nheight: ~\"calc(100% - 20px)\";\n```\n Look here for reference https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/less/modals.less#L375\n That was not the best idea :)\n So, if everything is fine, closing issue\n  Fixed in dev version\n  It does save data in this way, but not to data- attribute\n I guess we can close it, right? :) Reopen if issue is still not resolved\n  It could be totally prevented by setting \n\n```\nbody, html {\n  position:fixed;\n}\n```\n\nBut on overscroll it looks now not very friendly\n You can try this snippet:\n\n```\nvar prevTouchPosition;\nvar startScrollTop;\n$$(document).on('touchmove', '.page-content', function (e) {\n    var touchPosition = e.targetTouches[0].pageY;\n    var pageContent = this;\n    startScrollTop = pageContent.scrollTop;\n    if (typeof prevTouchPosition !== 'undefined') {\n        var direction = touchPosition - prevTouchPosition > 0 ? 'to-top' : 'to-bottom';\n        var pageScrollTop = pageContent.scrollTop;\n        if (startScrollTop === 0 && direction === 'to-top') {\n            e.preventDefault();\n        }\n        if (startScrollTop === pageContent.scrollHeight - pageContent.offsetHeight && direction === 'to-bottom') {\n            e.preventDefault();   \n        }\n    }\n    prevTouchPosition = touchPosition;\n}, true);\n\n$$(document).on('touchend', function(){\n    prevTouchPosition = startScrollTop = undefined;\n});\n```\n\nJust add it to your JS\n At least with this it is a way better. But still can't prevent/intercept very quick swipe gestures\n  Can you explain what you expect from them that you not enough in current realisation?\n @petarov are you using it to request `JSONP`?\n But as you may see in code, JSONP request is not XHR request at all, it is just loading JS using `<script>` tag. I may try to emulate these callbacks using `.onload` script callback but there is no much sense in it\n  iOS?\n Yes, there is bug (or such new default behavior) with overscroll in iOS8, need to see what will be in next update\n Swipeout and panel conflict is fixed in dev\n Closing as panels/swipe outs conflict resolved in 0.9.5\n  Why you get that it should be dispatched in this case? \"change\" event doesn't work like that. If you need to catch something during typing you need to use keyboard events 'keyup', 'keydown'\n Closing issue as no further response\n  Yes, it is pure CSS solution, look here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select\n  The same as #111 and many similar. Sorry it is iOS/Android default behavior, can't do anything with it. But if you use it in PhoneGap look at its plugins where you may find solution for that, maybe this plugin will help you https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/keyboard\n  Look at this solution http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/bugs-and-issues:scrolling-is-not-fixed\n Still not sure what you mean, but F7 doesn't use some special bounce effect, all you see is the default iOS behavior and not sure is it possible to disable it \n Closing as no further response. Reopen issue if you still have this problem\n  I am not really understand, do you have an issue with PTR? Just checked on Android 4.1 - 4.4 and seems to be works fine.\n Or how can i replicate it?\n Ok, thanks, will take a look closer. By the way, I see you use Opera browser, in default browser it is also exist?\n Fixed in dev version now, with similar approach\n  Not sure why you get it, Android 4.0 - 4.3 supports old flex box syntax, which is also used by Framework7. So checkboxes and radios works well on Androids 4.0 +\n @roshanca if you have this issue on Android 4+, tell your Android version and browser, and reopen issue\n Ok, i see now. But it is not because of flexbox. It is because of Android < 4.4 doesn't support CSS \"calc\" function. You may add this CSS rule for androids in your CSS:\n\n```\nhtml.android label.label-radio input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked ~ .item-inner, \nhtml.android label.label-radio input[type=\"radio\"]:checked ~ .item-inner {\n  background-position:90% center;\n}\n```\n  Closing for now. @ourcd reopen issue if your question was not answered\n  Framework7 is manly iOS specific, it is for iOS apps, so you shouldn't expect much from Android\n  Just checked, everything works fine. Provide more details, at least android and browser version\n Closing issue as no further response, details\n  > PS: How do you start the kitchensink locally? I guess you use a LAMP server because of the .php?\n\nLAMP server is only required for demo with infinite scroll. Otherwise, you can call built-in local server, in Kitchen Sink's folder:\n\n```\ngrunt build\ngrunt server\n```\n\n> One more thought: if the page name isn\u00b4t unique (the data-page has to be unique for the collection of pages, not for other views) we probably should also use the date or view name as suggested to you in the url...\n\nI guess we can restrict it to unique name for current View. That will be on developer\n\n> One limitation I\u00b4ve found when testing mixed environments: The push state is limited to the main view (in general, with or without this change). \n\nYes, it is limited to main View, that was by design, because watching all other views that may use different layouts, they may have dynamic content or ajax content or domCache like now. \n\n> I\u00b4ve had a look and it seems feasible to store the current view with the state, what do you think?\n\nI guess you mean on app refresh? Yes, it is possible, but it is not so easy to restore full history, i think we can restore last page, like now push state does for Ajax pages. By the way, good note, i need also to add restore for Dynamic content.\n\nAlso about restoring state. I was thinking about adding new feature like App State, which will remember state for all app views and popups with ability to restore full history on app load. Because as you may know push state on iOS is useless in home screen web apps and in phone gap apps, and i actually don't like how the push state works at all. So i am thinking about to store app state in local storage and drop Push State itself at all\n About your improvements, i will have more time tomorrow or day after to test and check it \n Trying to test it. The first thing that i see is the issue with default dynamic content (.loadContent). Issue seems to be in after go back. First of all it doesn't remove previous page, but adds \".cached\" class to it. Just check the default Dynamically Generated Content demo in Kitchen Sink, something goes wrong after you click on \"back\" link in navbar\n The following is also brings issue:\n\n```\nHome Page -> .switchContent('.about') -> .switchContent('.services') -> .switchContent('.about')\n```\n\nAfter this, the active page totally disappears and app becomes blocked because of allowPageChange is false\n The same with this\n\n```\nHome Page -> .switchContent('.about') -> .switchContent('.about')\n```\n This works:\n\n```\nHome Page -> .switchContent('.about') -> .switchContent('.services')\n```\n\nBut this not:\n\n```\nHome Page -> .switchContent('.services') -> .switchContent('.about')\n```\n Maybe you can make such fork, or make a different brunch in your fork so i will be able also to merge changes to your fork?\n Finally have found time to implement it, thanks for your help, it is already in dev version!\n  Sorry, but it is also not really correct, because it will not work if tab-link is not inside of tabs, right? And could break if we have tabs in tabs (nested tabs) :)\n Old structure worked fine with nested tabs, I'll write here correct code tomorrow and we'll close it)\n Just haven't much free time now, but as a solution we need to get previously active tab (oldTab) and then find its appropriate tab link in the same way like from lines 39 to 47\n Ok, i've just merged fix for that. This should cover any case of tab-link usage https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/dee878a0151563437130c5035dab0fdc7b81d4b3\n  Can you give me screenshot of this?\n I see now, that is because PTR uses css transform to move content down, and these titles use position:sticky. I guess its more iOS bug, it handles them not really correct. But will take a look how to fix them\n As a temporary workaround you can use item dividers (`<li class=\"item-divider\">Divider title here</li>`) instead of titles\n @ampyx as almost 3 years have passed can this issue be closed?  Looks nice. But i have some notes about this commit: https://github.com/thomasf1/Framework7/commit/8784843ae3d55da1095e62b9e50fb4b891927b44\n- Not really like that pages and navbars are connected by \"class\"/selector. So it looks like it may have pretty common class name that could be used for styling by other dev. Maybe its better to link them by data-page?\n\n```\n.navbar\n  .navbar-inner(data-page=\"index-1\")\n  .navbar-inner(data-page=\"about\").cached\n  .navbar-inner(data-page=\"services\").cached\n.pages\n  .page(data-page=\"index-1\")\n  .page(data-page=\"about\").cached\n  .page(data-page=\"services\").cached\n```\n\nAnd we can pass in JS just a page name:\n\n```\nmainView.switchPage('about');\n```\n- Also, i didn't test it yet, but i am wondering what will be with View's history and pushState?\n- Need to make sure that it will not break old domCache Ajax logic when it just keeps previously loaded pages\n- Need to make sure that it will work with all default layout types: http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar-toolbar-layouts.html\n With default domCache when it stores previously loaded pages, it just uses order of links in history and it can't be breaked. But in this case, need to look, it is more similar to how the loadContent works, so we probably can try to use something like `'#' + pageName + '-' + new Date().getTime()` as a page link to make it unique for each state: `#about-123123123`. The same will be for pushState\n  Right, docs are external http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/. If you want to modify docs, let me know and i'll update it\n I have in plans to put docs on github in near future, but definitely not in this repo, i'll put it to personal repo \n @lihongxun945 sounds cool, but don't hurry up, i will put F7's website to GitHub on this weekend, it also uses jade, so it will be much easier for you to work with\n Ok, docs are here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Website\n@lihongxun945 i see that work goes on http://framework7.cn Let me know when it will be ready so i can link it\n I see, I guess this is the author https://github.com/binggg\n  No, it is highly depends on layout, and pushState works only for main View. You can just add custom event listener to popstate event:\n\n```\n$(window).on('popstate', function(){\n  myApp.closeModal('.popup.modal-in');\n});\n```\n Closed due to no reaction by issue author after several months Well, on iOS this definitely is not a bug because there is no such behavior for pop-up (as there is no physical back button on the device).\r\n\r\nOn Android, yeah one could argue that this needs more refinement.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can create a plugin or pull-request to fix this.  It works, just make sure that you have correct View layout in popup and don't forget to initialize it\n  Hi there, i like this idea, and actually i have started to implement it couple of days ago, and man you guessed its file name https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/less/framework7.themes.less :) \n\nBut there will be small difference from your approach:\n- There will be themes and colors. \n- Themes will define whole app/view/page/component look, for example dark, white and default. In \"dark\" theme  all pages will have dark look, like in side panels in Kitchen Sink\n- Colors will define colors of links, buttons, icons. That is what you have called themes in your example. There will be iOS's default color shemes: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/ColorImagesText.html\n\nSo it would be syntax similar to this:\n\n```\n<!-- to apply theme and color to whole app -->\n<body data-theme=\"dark\" data-color=\"pink\"> ...\n\n<!-- to apply theme and color for page -->\n<div class=\"page\" data-theme=\"dark\" data-color=\"pink\"> ...\n```\n\nSuch syntax allows to use different combinations of themes and colors. Themes are already available in dev version, colors are on the way\n Hmm, i got some serious problems with themes. Maybe someone knows how to solve it?\nThe problem is that in CSS now we have:\n\n```\n.theme-yellow {...color rules...}\n.theme-orange {...same color rules...}\n.theme-pink {...same color rules...}\n```\n\nAnd with the following HTML structure:\n\n```\nbody.theme-pink //global theme\n  ...\n  .page.theme-orange //local page's theme\n```\n\nThe page will be still pink, not orange, because in CSS \"pink\" rules are after \"orange\" and i can't see way to rewrite it. Any help on how to solve it?\n Right, important useless here because all themes will have it. Anyway, seems to be I came to acceptable solution where will be themes and colors, which is already in dev\n There shouldn't be problems, new updates is based on classes, not on data-attributes.\nP.S. It also allows to colorize switches/checkboxes within 10 default colors\n Closing for now as color themes released in 0.9.5\n  If would prefer this in consistency with other methods (.pullToRefreshDone):\n\n```\napp.pullToRefreshRefresh = function (container) {\n    container = $(container);\n    if (container.length === 0) container = $('.pull-to-refresh-content');\n    if (container.hasClass('refreshing')) return;\n    container.addClass('transitioning refreshing');\n    container.trigger('refresh', {\n        done: function () {\n            app.pullToRefreshDone(container);\n        }\n    });\n};\n```\n\nOr maybe app.pullToRefreshTrigger or app.pullToRefreshStart :)\n Sure, will add it\n  Yep, this is very annoying thing :) It is hard to get correct keyboard size, since it has different size on different devices and also depends on orientation, so if we will count that it always open and consider lowest size in landscape orientation then messagebar could be really short :) \n\nSo i've added custom \"data-max-height\" attribute for messagebar to have instrument to limit it. It also could be useful in PhoneGap apps where you may detect panel open/close and its size using plugins and just set this attribute depending on that\n  Can you give me at least a screenshot of such alert?\n Closing issue as no further response, details\n  Merged, thanks\n  @cherokiie should be fixed now in dev\n  Merged, thanks\n  Already fixed in dev\n  There is a \"navbarTemplate\" parameter that allows flexible customisation of this. But it is ok, could be useful and faster way. There is only note is that you've forgot the spaces around \"of\". Add them here:\n\n```\n</span> ' + pb.params.ofText + ' <span\n```\n Ok, merged, thanks \n  It is possible, but i guess, you shouldn't include Login Screen (.login-screen) in popup. Use \"Embedded\" in popup's page or use Login Screen component instead of popup. For example with Standalone login screen, you need to have the following HTML structure:\n\n```\n.login-screen.modal-in\n  .view.view-login\n    .pages\n      .page(data-page=\"login-page\")\n        .page-content.login-screen-content\n          ...\n          <a href=\"register.html\">Register</a>\n```\n\nNow, to make this .view-login work for pages loading(like in main view) you just need to initialize it in js:\n\n```\nvar loginView = myApp.addView('.view-login');\n```\n\nThat is, should work\n Yes, to make any View to load pages it should be initialized\n  Where did you get \"allowClick\" ? It is not for a usage, mostly for internal work:)\nSlider prevents \"click\" event on \"slider-container\", not on each link to prevent adding a lot of additional event listeners. Try this:\n\n```\n$('.slider-container').on('click', 'a', function(){\n  alert('something');\n})\n```\n Ok, by the way, there is also \"onClick(slider, e)\" slider's callback, which does all necessary checks before firing, and you can get clicked element from e.target\n preventClicks works, but i'll try to explain it more detailed. Slider prevents click event during swipes and its click event handler is set on \"slider-container\". This is made to prevent clicks on default HTML elements like <a> and disable F7's clicks handler when required.\n\nYou have to understand that if you add your custom click handler on something that is inside of slider, then slider's preventClicks will not intercept it, because your click handler is deeper in DOM than slider's one.\nSo if you want to add your custom handler that should be also prevented by Slider you may add it on element that is parent to slider-container, for example, using live event:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('click', '.slider-container .something', function (){...})\n```\n About pagination buttons, they shouldn't switch slide by default. And i guess you'll agree that they are to small for fingers:) If you want to disable their fade you may set \"paginationHide\" parameter to `false`\n\nIf you also want to change slides by clicking on pagination buttons, there is a 'indexButton' parameter, where you can pass, for example: '.slider-pagination-bullet'\n That is really strange :) Because it is actually pass that parameter for you in the same way from attribute, here is from source code how it passed if you init slider from attributes:\n\n```\n...\npaginationHide: slider.data('paginationHide') && (slider.data('paginationHide') === 'true' ? true : false),\n```\n Oh, try not to use both attributes (with \"slider-init\" class) along with JS initialization, or Slider could be initialised twice\n  How you expect this should work? \n\".trigger\" just calls the function that was defined inside of this callbacks, this instrument is mostly intended for home page, because not all understand how to make callbacks for it.\n Ok, can you give me code example that you use for any of these pages and i show you how to handle it correctly in this case\n I think we can close it\n  That is because there is no support for \"inset\" on content blocks. But ok, let's add it, could be useful for someone else :)\n  They are not big problems, i think you shouldn't worry much about it.\n2) Re-paint on scroll\nIt is because of overflow:auto page containers. It doesn't scroll body, but just a container with page. That is why it repaints it. Nothing critical\n1) pull to refresh endless rendering\nIt is simple, it is because hidden \"preloader\" element that has animation. Again, nothing critical here\n\nNote, that these repaints are the most easiest operation for browser and doesn't affect much on performance\n Need to try, but many uses custom preloaders in this place and their animations will become broken. As i remember i have also tried to hide it (with display:none), but there is an iOS bug with combining it with -webkit-overflow-scrolling when it doesn't become visible later. But will try something\n Closing as continuous rendering solved in 0.9.5\n  Merged, thanks\n  Will you fix it so i can merge it?\n  Looks nice, but no, there is no chances for that on HTML\n Thanks, but this is absolutely different approach\n @murliatdure i know this lib. As for me such implementation is overkilling for mobile app, look how it works, it just duplicates whole! html content to each of faces. No chances to see such implementation in F7, and unfortunately there is no other approaches to achieve it\n  Thanks\n It is absolutely fine for me in iOS 7-8 if i pin KS to homescreen. If you pin it using iframe, then probably could be issues, but they are not F7-related\n  Yep, problem in mas-box-image, but for me it doesn't work at all at least in iOS 8 beta 4 simulator, it just crashes if i try to open Messages page. And it seems to be also beta's bug, hopefully it will be fixed in upcoming betas\n Just installed Yosemite beta and it seems to be that desktop Safari also crashes on messages page, nice :)\n Ok, seems to be fixed now in dev version, small refactoring of those svg masks seems to be prevents crashes and gives correct bubbles look\n Closing as fixed in 0.9.5\n  Looks very nice, but could you please make it so it doesn't affect dist/ files, just src/ and kitchen-sink/. Because it has some yesterday updates that are not tested yet and shouldn't get into stable release for now\n Ok, merged, thanks!\n  Yes, grunt builder with tutorial will be available on this week\n The only problem with it now, is that .less files, because they are imported in .less by .less, not by grunt. Probably need to rewrite main less file with grunt, but it is kind of hacky solution\n Already available in 0.9.4 http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/custom-build.html\n  Now, in dev, will be included in upcoming release\n It is included in just released 0.9.4 release:\n\n```\n<i class=\"icon icon-plus\">+</i>\n```\n  Hi, i am not sure that i understood what do you mean? Can you explain it more detailed if problem is not solved yet?\n Ok, i guess you are looking for a solution on how to hide tab bar. Look at these forum threads, there were some solutions http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/?hide tab bar\n  This already fixed in dev version\n  Hi, can you show what you mean by \"each pull-to-refresh must bind different element\"? This could be useful for anyone else\n Agh, yes, i though you mean something else :) It is ok, thanks\n  You should keep full structure inside of popup .view -> .pages -> .page ->.page-content. Otherwise you will have this iOS bug\n What do you mean with \"inactive background\"?\n @sbryfcz look here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/109\n @sbryfcz just make sure that your popup has full structure, like .popup > .view > .pages > .page > .page-content\n Closing for now, reopen issue if you still have this problem\n  Make sure that when you add your event listeners your '#list-1' element is already on a dom and not on some other page. \n That is something wrong. It should work on \"a\", as you may see it works fine in kitchen sink. Also all links handler done in the same way, so everything should work.\n\nNot sure what you mean about status bar color but it wasn't changed in update\n  Look here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/questions:preprocess-index-page\n  Yes, it is in the progress\n It is already in 0.9.3 update\n  Nope, not sure. What do you mean with \"When he pulls nothing\"? :)\n  Sounds cool and this is pretty requested feature. Checking it right now\n 'Captions! Woohoo!' :)\nMerged, thanks! \n No, not yet, some support for custom external links here... :)\n Yep, just wanted to wrote that such link will not match to .is() selector. \nAlso let's replace this:\n\n```\nif (clicked.hasRel(app.params.externalLinks[i])) {\n  return;\n}\n```\n\nwith just this:\n\n```\nif (clicked[0].rel === app.params.externalLinks[i]) {\n  return;\n}\n```\n\nAnd will remove .hasRel() method from DOM. I just don't want to introduce many non-standard (that people are not familiar with) Dom methods, cause in future i want to add ability to disable/remove Dom7 lib that could be relplaced with jQuery or Zepto for these libs fans :)\n\nAlso let's rename \"domObject\" photo's property to just \"object\" because it can be a bit confusing for someone, it looks like it expects for HTMLElement but not for string with something like '<video>'\n That is it! \"html\" sounds much better :) Will you change it again to \"html\" please ? Sorry :)\n\nAbout \"photo\" vs \"slide\", let's keep it \"photo\" because it doesn't affect usage api for end-users. And for us, developers, i think it would be easier to keep it \"photos\" to divide such terms as \"photo\" in a mean as Photo Browser slide, and \"slide\" as just a Slider's slide\n Awesome, thanks!\n What i also thinking to modify in captions. But these mostly questions:\n- Probably they shouldn't be a part of slide, so they will not move during slide, but just fade in/out for  appropriate slide. \n- Also should they have inverted style for light/dark layout? Or maybe make separate option to set light/dark layout for captions?\n- Should it be also hidden in expose mode, or to add option for this?\n\nWhat do you think?\n >  Are there already light/dark switches elsewhere?\n\nYep, there is a \"theme\" parameter on PhotoBrowser that allows to switch its color theme to dark or light. Yes, it is very simple CSS change, but developers/end-users sometimes don't know how to change CSS.\n\nOk, i will have more time tomorrow, will try something\n  Good note, thanks. I will add support for this in next update. I will add configurable \"found\" and \"not-found\" container via data- attributes, otherwise it will search them in pageContainer like in your example\n  Yes, you need to remove it from history and also remove it from Dom manually so there shouldn't be 'page-on-left' like:\n\n```\n//before you click back button on login page you need to remove details-page and modify history. \n//remove details page from history\nfor (var i = 0; i < mainView.history.length; i++) {\n  if (mainView.history[i] === 'details.html') mainView.history.splice(i,1);\n}\n//So when you are on login page, details page sit on left:\n$$('.view-main .page-on-left, .view-main .navbar-on-left').remove();\n```\n\nNow when you click \"back\" button on login page it will bring you to search results. But the problem is that search results page will be reloaded so results will be lost. For this you can enable domCache that will keep all pages in dom. In this case you need to rework a bit code above, but i hope you catch main logic\n Closing this as no further discussion, and there is a lot of new nav features with new router in 0.9.6. Reopen if you still have this issue\n  Merged, thanks\n  It is not so easy with domCache to jump through pages. But the main logic is should be the following: you need to remove from dom pages that are between actual page and target page and clear/modify View's history. Here is a simple example: http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/questions:the-view-goback-method\n Closing, as 0.9.6 has reworked router that allows such back \"jumps\"\n Reopen if you still have this issue\n  Hi,\nThanks, see this issue too, will look in how to fix it\n Wow, that is almost perfect Russian ;)\n Ok, should be fixed in dev version\n You mean Photo Browser? Do you see some errors in console?\n  There is a problem with this, like you have mentioned \"it is only fired at the end\" and touchmove also don't fired during inertia scrolling. So there is no way to do something during native scrolling on iOS. To make it work perfect we need to realize custom scrolling, but i am not happy with idea of custom scrolling\n Scroll also successfully triggered during touch move, the problem is in continuous scrolling when nothing is fired. So it is no sense to realize it with touch move. But it is seems to be that iOS 8 finally triggers scroll event even during inertia scrolling, so it can be easily realized using default scroll event\n  Hi there, it is iOS's bug and it can't be fixed in Safari browser, at least i didn't find any solution yet. But it could be fixed in PhoneGap app using appropriate options in config.xml\n @xthilakx can you share with this hacky approach?:)\n Closing it for now\n  This looks bad:) Any advice on how can i debug it with web inspector on Android simulator?\n Thanks, will try to fix it tomorrow\n Ok, that is seems to be no way to fix this. Checked with weinre all possible solutions but still no luck. Seems like Android's Chrome bug\n @tsachyg not familiar with Android's bug tracking system. If you can report it, please report it )\n @tsachyg thanks\n Closing it for now\n  Hey there. You can try to add this css rules to your css file:\n\n```\n.pages {\n   overflow: 'auto';\n   -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n.page-content {\n   margin-bottom:1px;\n}\n```\n That is right. This CSS fix should do its job. Try to add it and remove your touchmove listener\n Work for everyone here http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/?margin-bottom\nBy the way, this fix requires that you content should be wrapped with full page layout: .view > .pages > .page. \n Oh, sorry, <code>overflow: 'auto'</code> should be without quotes : <code>overflow:auto</code>\n And it is for iOS, don't know about Android\n Ok, let me know if you find suitable solution\n Just for note. Main point of this solution is to make your .page-content at least 1px larger than .page to always keep that bouncing effect which requires for scrollable content\n You can see that it works on default Kitchen sink:\nBefore this css fix:\n![08 2014 23 18 03 ios](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/3515322/cc26b71c-06d4-11e4-94a5-f686dc57dbf5.png)\nAfter this css fix:\n![08 2014 23 18 40 ios](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/3515323/cc4f2fee-06d4-11e4-8e15-f54a4cc8dcb3.png)\n  Can you show me a part of code related to Action sheet loading and initializing (opening)?\n It is still not pretty clear for me, but what can i guess is that on moment when you add callback for this button it is still not in the DOM. So just try to change it to live event:\n\nInstead of this\n\n```\n$$('.demo-actions').on('click', function () {\n```\n\ntry this\n\n```\n$$(document).on('click', '.demo-actions', function () {\n```\n This code is ok, but actually in most of cases movie.html?id=123 and movie.html?id=456 are different urls because these GET parameters can be handled by server and response with different content.\n\nBut idea is good, i think i'll add some option to ignore these GET parameters if needed\n  No chances for that, and i really not recommend you to use such DOM ready event, because it is useless and just adds extra delays. But if you need such event, you can just do it with pure JS:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('DOMContentLoaded', function(){\n  ... your document ready code here...\n});\n\n```\n  Can't say for sure, but not in near feature\n Yes, i saw it. Looks nice. But i can start to implement it after i have a real device with it or at least in usable emulator. But seems like system will be released only in Autumn\n Closing it for now, as i am going to implement materials theme/plugin/fork in different repo\n  Try to open your app in iOS simulator, or connect your iOS device to Mac. Open your app/website and look at Developer tools in desktop Safari. Are there any errors?\n Not sure that it will work on Windows, at least there is no recent Safari version for Windows.\nOk, there one thing is came to my mind. If you use it as Phonegap app, don't forget to check whitelist url's, probably requested URL is not allowed by your app settings.\n\nP.S. How you are going to debug and release iOS app without Mac, it would not be easy ;)\n It has not any restrictions or rules. Just like you always did it. By the way default routing and navigation between pages works on the same methods, and i guess it works for your right?\n\nBy the way, one more thing i see right now is that you use getJSON and expect 'false' string in data variable. But it is impossible, data will be JSON object, so make sure that requested file answers with correct JSON. \n And one more thing to check, make sure that requested host is the same as your webapp's, it is prohibited to use cross domain requests with getJSON, only JSONp request is allowed\n  There is no built-in icons, only few default ones for navigation. Yes, you may that icons library or use any other you like\n  He Greg,\nI am watching on this PR for a long time :) I see that was a huge work, but why? I am personally not fun of single line declaration of all variables because it really reduces code readability and bring some problems to debug process\n  Merged, thanks\n  How did you fixed it?\n As on option what comes to my mind, if you have server-side localization, you could, for example, modify XHR headers to add some custom header with language\n Thanks! Let's keep it opened for a while, should be useful for others\n Or, as an option by modifying global XHR header for all requests:\n\n```\nvar language = navigator.userLanguage || navigator.language;\n$$(document).on('ajaxStart', function(e){\n  var xhr = e.detail.xhr;\n  xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Request-Language', language)\n})\n```\n  Strange, but can't replicate this issue, at least on 7.1. Can you try to add this code and look maybe it would be better for you:\n\n```\n$('input[type=\"file\"]').on('touchstart', function(e){\n  e.stopPropagarion();\n})\n```\n Or you can try to disable fastClicks to see may be it causes problem\n  By tablet size you mean iPad or Android tablets?\n That is because android tablets with hi dpi screens scale viewport. Try to play with viewport meta tag, for example try to set:\n\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"target-densitydpi=device-dpi\" />\n```\n Closing it for now\n  Yep, broken in demo because syntax recently changed. In the docs they are in Form Elements section.  @youssefdetovernickr show correct example :+1: \n  Merged, thanks\n But i will rename it to \"searchClear\" and also add \"searchEnable\" and \"searchDisable\" events\n No, i will not rename it:)\n  I think autocomplite attribute should be \"off\" to disable native browser's autocomplite in favor of custom JS one by google (it is also \"off\" here:  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete?hl=ru)\n\nWhy it is not working it is hard to say. Do you see any errors in console, or do you have a live links so i can take a look?\n Ok, i figured this out. The autocomplite popup just appears below F7 views and pages add this css rule:\n\n```\n.pac-container {\n  z-index:20000;\n}\n```\n That something wrong with events in google widget. Try to add this JS for appropriate page, or when this block appear in DOM:\n\n```\n$$('.pac-container').on('touchend', function(e){e.stopPropagation();})\n```\n No, this part doesn't related to that. It is about when you select text on page. Try to move this fix:\n\n```\n$$('.pac-container').on('touchend', function(e) { \n            console.log('touchend');\n            e.stopPropagation(); \n        });\n```\n\nTo the end of page name condition, after this line: <code>google.maps.event.addListener(autocomplete, 'place_changed', placeChanged);</code>\n This means that on the moment when you add these listeners the '.pac-container' is not in DOM yet. So you can try to use google api's and add these listeners when this container appear in DOM or you can just try this live listener instead:\n\n```\n$$('body').on('touchend','.pac-container', function(e){e.stopImmediatePropagation();})\n```\n  Everything this is already possible. You just need to have from wrapped with .page (and more better with .pages and .view). And you can use separate views in popups and panels from very first F7 version. Just look at the Right panel in kitchen sink\n I guess i can close this issue, cause everything this is realized. Reopen if you still have this issue\n  You can hide it for example by adding \"hidden-toolbar\" class to \"views\":\n\n```\n//to hide toolbar\n$$('.views').addClass('hidden-toolbar');\n\n//to show toolbar\n$$('.views').removeClass('hidden-toolbar');\n```\n You can also add this CSS rule:\n\n```\n.views {\n  overflow:hidden;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: auto;\n}\n```\n  The problem here is that on the moment of preprocess we haven't any pages in DOM, it is just HTML string. You can use such tips:\n\n```\npreprocess: function (content, url, next) {\n  var query = $$.parseUrlQuery(url);\n  //instead of page.name you can use search in string:\n  if(content.indexOf('data-page=\"about\"')>=0) { ... do something for About page }\n}\n```\n  Such links with external protocols require additional \"external\" class\n ```\n<a class=\"external\" href=\"mailto:someone@some.com\">Mail</a>\n```\n  Yes, it was released since 0.8.8\n  Thanks, my bad:) Will fix it\n  Yes, it is already there in 0.8.8 release\n  Yep, it was removed out there. Now with 0.8.8 i returned it back\n  Hey there,\nBut this is a prompt modal (myApp.prompt), no?:)\n Here it is how it looks like by default: \n![prompt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/3348845/76e9e1ae-f944-11e3-8324-44bd346a97fa.png)\n Now you can do it with custom .modal() method. But new modalLogin and modalPassword modals will be in next update that should be released today or tomorrow\n  Nice feature, also was thinking about it, but was thinking about to name it like \"next\" instead of \"callback\" like in many JS routers. Anyway PR should pass build process to merge it. Look at this errors in build:\n\n```\nbuild/js/framework7.js\n  line 963   col 19  Missing space after 'if'.\n  line 963   col 51  Missing space after ')'.\n  line 966   col 14  Missing space after '}'.\n  line 966   col 18  Missing space after 'else'.\n  line 970   col 30  'callback' was used before it was defined.\n  line 970   col 39  Missing space after ')'.\n  line 1315  col 27  Missing space after 'if'.\n  line 1315  col 56  Missing space after ')'.\n  line 1318  col 22  Missing space after '}'.\n  line 1318  col 26  Missing space after 'else'.\n  line 1322  col 38  'callback' was used before it was defined.\n  line 1322  col 44  Missing space after ')'.\n```\n\nJust run local <code>grunt build</code> to make sure that you have not this errors anymore, and i will merge it\n Merged, thanks\n  You can do it by passing url query\n\n```\nmainView.loadPage('about.html?id=5&foo=bar');\n\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function(e){\n  var page = e.detail.page;\n  console.log(page.query.id); //5\n  console.log(page.query.foo); //bar\n})\n```\n  You can just add this css rule:\n\n```\n.button {\n  text-overflow: clip;\n}\n```\n Closing issue as no further response\n  It works properly only in mobile Safari\n Check these demo examples from iOS Safari and you will see\n  Ok, will be there in next release on a days\n Added in 0.8.7 release\n  Fixed in dev\n Fixed in stable 0.8.7 release\n  Thanks, George.\nYou should not do loadContent again, you just need to replace content manually. For example:\n\nYou have some page with loader:\n\n```\n<div class=\"page\" data-page=\"page-with-preloader\">\n  <div class=\"page-content\"> .. just preloader here ...</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen page is loaded you do custom Ajax request and just replace page content with new one:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('pageAfterAnimation', function(e){\n  var page = e.detail.page;\n  if (page.name == 'page-with-preloader') {\n    //Make custom Ajax request\n    $$.get('something', function (data) {\n      //And replace page-content\n      $$(page.container).find('.page-content').html(data)\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSo you don't need at all to load another page, do everything here\n Closing as seems to be solved\n  Hi there,\nThere is no any strict rules here. You can use whatever you prefer and like. I personally don't really like modular stuff in custom App's code, for me much easier and faster to split code on separate small functions. Someone using it with Angular, someone with React, so you are free to go here\n  Merged, thanks!\n  It is possible. If you want to just load any page as a new page you can use View's .loadPage method. If you need to go back to the custom page, it is a bit complicated. But you can just remove previous page from DOM:\n\n```\n$$('.view-main .page-on-left').remove();\n//And now call goBack with URL\nmainView.goBack('custom.html');\n```\n  Agree, and this is already on the go, i will make different overlays for popups/modals/action sheet and popovers in next release \n Fixed in 0.8.7\n  That is cool. Right now downloading new XCode with iOS 8 preview. If this is true, of course, will add it\n Added for iOS 8 in 0.9.4\n  Closing as seems to be solved\n  Popup cannot be closed automatically on Ajax calls because there are a lot if situtations when you need these calls and transitions inside of popup. So if you need to close popup when you load page in main view, just add \"close-popup\" class to any link within it\n Still not really clear for me what you tried to achieve. It would be good to see more code, at least structure where is this link in structure and where you need (in which view) to load page.\n\nHere is more info on how linking works\nWhen you click any link (&lt;a&gt;) here is what happens:\n1) First of all F7 checks does it have additional \"external\" class. If link has this class, then F7 doesn't do anything with this link, and it works like usual browser link, so it just reloads browser window to new URL if you don't have custom event handlers on this link.\n2) Otherwise, if link's href is not '#' it will try to do Ajax request and load new page with transition in View.\n3) Now the question is in which View new page should be loaded. Here, F7 search first link's parent div class=\"view\". And if this found view was initialized with <code>app.addView()</code> page will be loaded here\n4) Otherwise if there is no any parent View or there is no parent initialized View, F7 look at link's <code>data-view</code> attribute which could point on another view. And if there is no this attribute new page will be loaded to main view\n Closing for now as no further discussion\n  Thanks, will fix it\n Ok, fixed in dev version\n Fixed in stable 0.8.7 release\n  That is seems like rendering issue. Just try to add such CSS rules to your popup navbar:\n\n```\n-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\nbackface-visibility: hidden;\n-webkit-transform-style:preserve-3d;\ntransform-style:preserve-3d;\n-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);\ntransform: translate3d(0,0,0);\n```\n Closing as seems to be fixed. Reopen if you still have this issue\n  Yes, it is possible. Look at this forum thread http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/#!/questions:the-view-goback-method\n Closing, as no further discussion, if you still have this issue, reopen it\n  Yes, this is correct syntax for that\n  Hi, there is a <code>modalPopupCloseByOutside</code> app parameter (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/init-app.html) which allows to control it.\n\nAnd you can toggle it with JS in any moment:\n\n```\n//disable\napp.params.modalPopupCloseByOutside = false;\n//enable \napp.params.modalPopupCloseByOutside = true;\n```\n i think i need to rename it to  just <code>popupCloseByOutside</code>\n Yes, note that in next release this params will be renamed https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/7d86c450e536032af5007b3d3b5bb8b730a8399b\n  All good, thanks\n I also add navbar init for \"goBack\" https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/e846093caaeb264761bf9634ee70db4255b95749\n  Hi @SidneyS \nWork in this direction is already in progress. I promise that to version 1.0 it will be possible to use it with MV\\* frameworks without a hassle  \n @tbergeron i guess no, seems to be something went wrong\n @articobandurini it should arrive in 0.9.7, around in 2-3 weeks\n @jackson-sandland of course, that what is made for. Check the show case section http://www.idangero.us/framework7/showcase/\n @DustinJSilk yes, potentially 0.9.7 update already allows to use any 3rd party framework or data-binding library. I will make some new demos for that, just need to get some time\n @DustinJSilk maybe you can provide some code examples or snippets so i may create new demo app on how to combine Marionette with F7?\n @DustinJSilk thanks\n F7 is already compatible and can be used with many MVC frameworks, but not from the box. At least i see that many people using it with Angular and Meteor without problems. So i am closing this issue\n  I am not sure what iOS Safari issue/bug do you mean. But changing viewport scale to 0.5 is absolutely not, it will bring much more problems and inconvenient development process because you will need to use everything in double size: images, fonts, borders, backgrounds, sizes, etc. It will also significantly reduce app performance \n Closing it for now\n  No, it can't at the moment. Probably this will be in next release. If you really need it, you can use Swiper instead of built in slider idangero.us/sliders/swiper/\n  Could be. F7 has internal fast clicks lib that is optimized for iOS. Need to look. But for now you can disable this lib by passing <code>fastClicks: false</code> parameter and using third party fast click library like this one https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick\n  I am not sure that something in F7 will work on Android 2.3. It works better from 4.0 and very good on 4.4. No chances for 2.3 :)\n I think i can close this issue, right?:)\n  You shouldn't worry about garbage collection, It is Browser's job. In this part this event will be triggered only once when new page came to DOM. And after it will be removed and then added again your #test element will be other DOM element, not those you attach event before, so everything will be fine here. \nIf you worry about your event listeners and you want to help Browser to remove them when elements removed from DOM, you may use additional 'pageBeforeRemove' callback where you can detach your event listeners from removed page\n I think we can close this issue, right?:)\n  No, there is no such search bar at the moment, it is on the road map. But even when it will be added i am not sure that i will implement \"automatic\" search through tableview\n By the way, it is already arrive in 0.8.7\n  @BelinChung i can't say like that. It will be good to see live example, or JSFiddle, or maybe video screencast of problem\n @matthewball do you still have your issue?\n Everything is correct. Because you load page in inactive tab, you just need to switch tab manually:\n\n```\n$$('.logout-button').on('click', function(){\n  //Emulate click on first tab-link to switch tab\n  $$('.tabbar .tab-link').eq(0).click();\n});\n```\n But you should probably do that not on login-button click, but in your Confirm callback\n Ok, you can do it then like that:\n\n```\n$$('.logout-button').on('click', function(){\n  //Emulate click on first tab-link to switch tab\n  $$('.tabbar .tab-link').removeClass('active');\n  $$('.tabbar .tab-link').eq(0).addClass('active');\n  $$('.tabs .tab.active').removeClass('active');\n  $$('.tabs .tab').eq(0).addClass('active');\n});\n```\n @matthewball That is somewhere problem on your side, because it can't just stop working. And i can't help you much because you don't post any example ;) As you may see in kitchen sink and in all examples it works fine :)\n Ok, i opened it. So everything seems to be works great. What i do:\n1) From Home tab i go to Firmwares tab\n2) I click, for example iOS 5, \n3) On iOS 5 page i click Back link in navbar\n4) Then i switch to Home tab again\n5) I switch to Firmwares again\n6) And links here are still working as expected\nWhere is the problem?\n Closing as seems to be problem is gone \n  Can't say for sure because i don't know how this plugin works from inside. Can you show your code and what you already tried?\n I mean that i don't know how it works from inside. Probably this plugin watch for scrolling on &lt;body&gt; element which is not applicable for F7, in F7 scrolling element is .page-content, not &lt;body&gt;\n  Right, will fix it in update. Now you can just add in CSS:\n\n```\n.button {\n  -webkit-appearance: none;\n}\n```\n  \u0414\u0430, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c pushState \u0432 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445: http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/init-app.html\n \u0413\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e)) \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043a \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\n  Hi,\nBut the current behavior we can see in lot of most popular iOS apps like Facebook and Twitter. As about your behavior, the only app is on my mind with such behavior is only Mail app, which else?\n Yes, i see it only in Mail app. So if such behavior will have more requests, i will realize it\n  Yes, that is what i am avoid. I just don't want that all html classes looks like f7-panel, f7-views, f7-view, f7-pages, f7-page, .etc:) Of course i will make main classes configurable via app parameters a bit later\n Ok, view classes are now configurable via parameters like:\n\n```\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n  viewClass: 'my-view',\n  viewsClass: 'my-views',\n  viewMainClass: 'my-view-main'\n})\n```\n Closing issue as this already realised\n  Everything is ok with custom alert. Your code logic is a bit wrong and produces infinite loop. \nWhen you click on alert's \"ok\" button it produces \"blur\" event. This is not a good idea to use such kind of logic with alert, even with native alert it is bad because app stays unusable until input stays empty. Maybe it would be better if you will use some notification text message somewhere near with input, or adding some specific styles to it\n With native alert it works because native alert window is not part of document/dom so clicking on it doesn't produce another \"blur\" event. But anyway even with native alert you can't do something else until input is empty:)\n Hey @morer did you handle this problem?\n  Answered in #47 \n Ok, i came to conclusion that i will not implement such option because there is a lot of such protocols http://wiki.akosma.com/IPhone_URL_Schemes . So such links will just require for additional \"external\" class\n  Hey, good catch, will fix it.

It is framework for ios, not for ff and especially not for IE:) Unfortunately ff and ie don't support \"appearance\" css property well, and to make it look like on WebKit requires a lot of additional code. And at the moment I will not do that for not target browsers\n Thanks, that is what I am afraid of - additional element:) I will check tomorrow, if this ok with fast clicks library and works good on Android and iOS 6+ then I will merge it.\n Fixed in 0.7.5\n  Hi there, yes, you can do that:\n\n```\n// Events for specific pages when it initialized\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function (e) {\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n    // Handle Modals Page event when it is init\n\n    if (page.name === 'ticket') {\n        $$(page.container).append('----- HERE ------'); // will work\n        // Get parameters\n        var id = page.query.id; // here should be your 101 id\n        // API call \n        // gen dynamic contnet\n    }\n```\n Sorry, one line wrong, it should be:\n\n```\n$$(page.container).find('.page-content').append('----- HERE ------'); // will work\n```\n Did it worked for you?\n  Yep, my is 0.9.0. Just updated, so will fix rails dist with upcoming update\n I didn't check yet. But ok, already change it to \"assets\"\n Ok, i think it is fine now, so closing issue\n  Thanks!\n  I see, but how this is related with Framework7? Maybe some server problem?\n Ok, do you understand that my-app.js script is not a Node script, right?:) It is a front-end script file, for browser. Your node code (where you try to include node modules) should be in other server-side script file\n Yes, it is possible, but you should do it on your server side\n  Thanks, that a lot of changes!:)\nDo you think it is a good idea to keep rails pipeline in this repo and not in your repo at https://github.com/twss/framework7-rails ? I am afraid that people may ask questions about rails from me, but i am not a rails pro:)\n  Init function triggers when page is loaded to DOM, so on home page, it will work on first load of app, or if go in navigation deeper than 3rd page.\n\nIf you want to handle it on app first load, then in kitchen sink example it will not work because it triggers before you add event handler $(document).on('pageInit'), so to make it work you need to add your event listener before you init app, before <code>var myApp = new Framework7()</code>\n\nBut actually on app load you don't need it for home page, just write code that you need to do with home page after <code>var myApp = new Framework7()</code> without any events\n Don't need to remove, you can just keep it empty:\n\n```\n<div class=\"navbar\"><div class=\"navbar-inner\"></div></div>\n```\n\nAlso add to your home page div additional \"no-navbar\" page:\n\n```\n<div class=\"page no-navbar\" data-page=\"index\">...</div>\n```\n\nAnd finally, add \"hidden-navbar\" class to your main view:\n\n```\n<div class=\"view main-view hidden-navbar\">...</div>\n```\n  Hi there,\nI personally not familiar with Angular, never used it, so there will no be much help from me:) But I am looking to add such drivers here for common MVC libs like Angular, Ember, etc.\n\nI think we need an Angular pro here to answer your question;)\n Hey guys, can you try to explain me (as a non-angular user) why you need it here and how you use it, what for? F7 is already has pretty solid routing. If you need angular as template engine (for example to parse your JSON and create content dynamically) it is already possible, you can just include your favorite template engine lib and use <code>view.loadContent</code> method to load dynamically generated content.\n\n@MathiasTim as for me, unfortunately ionic is pretty far away from ios 7 look and behavior:)\n @fabiobiondi are you going to make Framework7 work with Angular?:)\n I am thinking about that. I think about to add option to disable built-in router, so you can build your own with totally custom animations and transitions. Also i will try to expose methods for page transitions which also should give opportunity to use it with 3rd party routers\n Hi, that sound good and seems to be just three new lines is all you need to realize it. So ok, i will add this callback in upcoming release. By the way, i'm going to add Plugins API to framework, that will be based on many hooks, they will give you more flexibility\n @yoorek by the way. I am also thinking about to add option to disable built in router, so you can create your own (for example with Angular) with own transitions (probably just with duplicated logic from F7's code) where you just need to call methods like app.pageInitCallback, app.pageAnimCallback to init framework's components. What do you think? \n Guys, thanks to @cnjsstong2 'navbarInit' event is already in dev version: https://github.com/cnjsstong2/Framework7/commit/ac5530e6829fb114339889bdd53fed92e062500c\n @cnjsstong2 @yoorek can you guys tell me on which \"page loading\" parts (or any code parts) you would like to see plugin hooks callbacks? You will be able to use these hooks instead of event listeners in your angular plugin\n Hooks are similar to callbacks, your Angular plugin structure could look like:\n\n```\nFramework7.prototype.plugins.myPluginName = function (app, params) {\n  ... do any safe scoped code here\n  ... and return hooks\n  return {\n    onPageInit: function (page) {},\n    onNavbarInit: function (page) {},\n    onAjaxStart: function (xhr){},\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo the cool part is that F7 will call your plugin's local hooks function\n Ok, guys, from new 0.8.6 release there is a new Plugin's API. \n\nI've made demo plugin with main plugin structure with hooks https://gist.github.com/nolimits4web/2a7e3b597bd2d8dbaf01 \n\nThis plugin does nothing, just console log each hook with arguments. So you can already try to make it like Angular plugin. At least it would be better than using event listeners. There are not much hooks at the moments, now they mostly like 'pageInit' callbacks. But let me know or PR if you need more hooks \n @yoorek @cnjsstong2 guys, do you have any success/progress with using plugin hooks and Angular? Is it more convenient than using page events listeners?\n Hey there,\nYes, as i see now, navbarInit happens when page is not yet in DOM but it is available, it just detached. But you got it right, i will make its call a bit later when page is already avaiable in DOM. And will take a look to add navbar to pageInit\n\nThanks for sharing a code, it is a dark forest for me :), but i am sure it could be useful for Angular users\n @kevincobain2000 i am not strong in Angular, but i see that many already use F7 with Angular, so yes, you can use it with Angular\n  Right, good catch. Will add this feature. \nAt the moment you can add it dynamically to body and call app.popup() method. Or you can put it inside of page and within callback move it from page to body, that should make a trick:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function (e) {\n   var page = e.detail.page;\n   var pagePopup = $$(page.container).find('.popup);\n   if(pagePopup.length>0) {\n       $$('body').append(pagePopup);\n       // if you need to open it right now:\n       myApp.popup(pagePopup);\n   }\n});\n```\n Ok, it is already in dev version, but you have to pass full popup html, you can use it like\n\n```\nmyApp.popup('<div class=\"popup\">Hello, <a href=\"#\" class=\"close-popup\">close me</a></div>', true);\n```\n\nthe last boolean parameter is removeOnClose, if true (by default it is true) popup will be removed from DOM after you close it\n Ok, closing the issue. Reopen if you'll have problems with it\n  Right, i came to such solution instead of change navbar height for few reasons:\n- first of all, you probably should just color this statusbar-overlay with the color of navbar\n- what to do on pages without navbar? In this case status bar text will overlap page content. But with this solution it always will have bg color\n- and the most important part is that you can change its color dynamically. Try for example to open http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/ in Chrome, in developer tools in Emulation section enable Emulate screen and set it 320x480 and reload page. You will see that this black overlay will appear. And then open left side panel and you will note that it change color to gray from black:) This feature used by many native apps. The closest example is a iPhone's Facebook app - status bar overlay change its color when you open panels\n <blockquote>Btw, device.webview = !!navigator.standalone; returns false in UIWebView. But I able to detect UIWebView by checking User Agent. What do you think?</blockquote>\n\nDidn't note that, then you are right, it should be changed to User Agent check. Share your solution please:)\n Ok, with latest updates everything fine, overlay appears?\n Ok, great;)\n  Ok, problem again:) As i understand you already merged latest 0.6.8 release, so can you just tell me which files i need to get from your fork at https://github.com/omerduzyol/Framework7/tree/master/src ?\n As i understand it is just only pages.js, views.js and navbars.js, right?\n Ok, i just merged dom cache manually, but made few fixes:\n1) In this part in _load function\n\n<pre>\n} else {\n            app._tempDomElement.innerHTML = '';\n            $(app._tempDomElement).append(<b>content</b>);\n        }\n</pre>\n\nYou had here content[0], but i don't understand why? As i understand this case is when we pass HTMLElement, so if we do something like:\n\n```\nvar page = document.create('div');\npage.className = 'page';\nmainView.loadContent(page);\n```\n\nIt will not work, so i revert it back without <b>[0]</b>\n\n2) In afterGoBack function in this part:\n\n```\n    // Check current page is content based only\n    if (!view.params.domCache && view.url.indexOf('#content-')...\n```\n\nWe need additional check of view.url, because on app load, view may have not url like with view in right panel, so i add:\n\n```\n    // Check current page is content based only\n    if (!view.params.domCache <b>&& view.url</b> && view.url.indexOf('#content-')...\n```\n\n3) I add .page.cached{display:none}, because during swipe back gesture we may see a lot semi transparent pages:) But i am not sure can it affect something or not\n\nAlso, it has some bug with navbars somewhere, especially if there is a page without navbar in navigation chain. But let's keep for a while. I want totally rework part with navbars/toolbars changing.\n\nBtw, can you guid me about subEvents, what is it and how does it work. I see that this is for iframes but can't understand without example :) And why you use it only in _load and not in _preload function?\n Ok, i've merged your webview detection. But we can't detect it based on this rule: <code>device.statusBar = iosNative && parseFloat(device.osVersion) >= 7;</code>\nYour app when in webview may be not in full screen, for example when you add webapp to home screen with <code>meta(name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\", content=\"black\")</code> or also in XCode/PhoneGap it also possible to make view chopped by status bar. So as i see it can be detected only based on window width/height.\n\nAnd i just checked latest build in phonegap and homescreen webapp and status bar overlay appears when required.\n By the way, remove your fork from github and refork it again, because as i understand all your pull requests will not merge automatically\n Ok, everything is merged, closing)\n  Wow, thanks!:) \n\n### Swipe back\n\nThe most performant problem here is because of animating box-shadow on \"right\" page. Now it is possible to disable it by passing appropriate parameter. I may force to disable it on iOS 6, but think it is better to give opportunity to user to decide should he disable it or enable\n\n### Slider\n\nThis part is really fun, because it is actually 100% default input:range with no single line of JavaScript:) Don't event know what can be done here\n\n### Swipe to delete\n\nI think that now i will add fallback option to simply open/close it with simple swipe without smoothing move below finger/mouse\n\n### Pull to refresh\n\nThat is the problem, yes. Because as you note, first pulls are made by setting translate on page container while native scroll unavailable. Need to think here...\n\n### Form inputs\n\nYep, i will not merge FastClick lib into Framework7. It has own similar system. As you see it is already ok for any links and buttons. Just need to improve it for inputs\n\n### Switch\n\nThat is probably unfixable problem:) Switch is made with single input:checkbox element, and unfortunately iOS 6 doesn't support animation/transition on pseudo elements like :after, :before\n\n### Scroll\n\nYes, problem exist, it is because live event handlers, already work on improvements\n Guys, don't worry:) No one trying to make it compatible with all devices. But it is also good to understand why it works slow on some old devices OS, because some improvements for old devices  also improve overall framework performance ;)\n I think we may close it for now\n  This looks interesting. Can you make another PR with it? This one can't be merged automatically for some reason\n What am i thinking. As i see such behavior and problem is related mostly to forms, right? So maybe it is easier just automatically serialize and store forms data in the view object, and then just parse it on related form page during init event, what do you think?\n\nI am thinking about that, because anyway we need something like automatically form saver, because in native iOS apps there is no \"Save/Submit\" buttons on forms, they all work automatically\n Of course i still need it:) Just make another PR, this one seems to be non merge able \n  Yes, good catch, this is because of translates. Will fix it with devicePixelRatio condition cause it also affect desktops. \nOf course, if you have time open another issue with more bugs/slow things you will find there. Will try to fix everything that is possible. Cause it also important for iOS 6 and all its devices, not only for 3GS\n Closing as it is already fixed\n  Right, pageInit method called only when we chaning the page and new page comes to DOM. So for home page it will be triggered only on the app first load and when you go deeper then 2nd page in navigation. You may use pageBeforeAnimation callback, it will be triggered everytime page is changed its position\n If you need that pageInit callback on first app load, you need to write $$(document).on('pageInit', ...) handler before you init app with <code>myApp = new Framework7()</code>\n Right, $$ will not be available before app init, so here are all ways to achieve this:\n1) Before app initialization:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener('pageInit', function (e) { ... })\nvar myApp = new Framework7();\n```\n\n2) Using callback instead of event listener:\n\n```\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    onPageInit: function (page) {\n        ...\n    }\n});\n```\n\n3) Init app manually:\n\n```\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    init: false // prevent app from automatic initialization \n});\nvar $$ = myApp.$;\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function (e) {\n    ...\n})\nmyApp.init(); // init app manually after you've attached all handlers\n```\n Oops, i was wrong, none of this methods work for index page:) Working to fix it\n Ok, now my examples will work in dev version\n Ok, closing issue as it was fixed. If will have problems with it, reopen it\n  Wow, that is a lot of changes:) By loading static content you mean that now we can just do something like <code>mainView.loadContent('&lt;div class=\"page\"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;') </code> to load new page, right?\n If yes, then it is awesome) I am just thinking about realizing such feature. Just a quick question before merge. Doesn't it break history when we navigate back for example in such kind of route: <code>home page -> generated page -> real html page -> one more generated page -> another html page</code>?\n Thanks to you for awesome improvement! Let's add ability to load it from string and need to fix goBack functionality. It just need to work with any combination of routes like generated page -> loaded page -> generated page, loaded page -> generated page ->  generated page, etc:)\n Works super awesome, thanks!)\n About loading/parsing JS, good question, for one side we probably need it, but from other side isn't it better to keep app's logic in single (main) script file?\n @omerduzyol by the way, any idea/solution on how to parse/load scripts in Ajax loaded files?\n If you did nice extra features don't hesitate to push or show them:) MVC lib sounds interesting, and this what I actually aware of on first stage, but of course this would be useful for those who familiar with them. Can you show me usage example of such MVC addition with this lib?\n I think i can make MVC support pluginable in separate single script file, so if user need use marionette he just add additional script file like framework7.marionette.js and everything works. This will allow to keep main script from grow and would be useful if we want to create other drivers for Angular, Ember, etc. But to make pluginable structure i need to see changes that will be made in pages.js/views.js etc.\n By the way, found a small bug, in afterGoBack function:\n\n```\nif (view.url.indexOf('#content-') > -1 && (view.url in view.contentCache)) {\n```\n\nshould be changed to\n\n```\nif (view.url && view.url.indexOf('#content-') > -1 && (view.url in view.contentCache)) {\n```\n\nBecause by default, view may have no url, like in side panels, so after you go back there it throws error here.\n Already pushed fix\n  Yes, this is because Android's browser is incredibly slow:) Just commit some degradation that should improve a bit transitions on Android.\n  This piece of code contains two superfluous <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> in the end\n At least the example in your post you have 8 opening divs and 10 closing:) You can post full code of HTML page\n Ok, now it looks correct. And it should work. Don't you forget to initialize this view? Show me your JS related to Framework7 where you init app and views\n At the moment, when no other support resources it is ok with new issues here. I will try to launch cloud forum today evening\n Just launched the forum at http://www.idangero.us/framework7/forum/\n  Thanks:)\n  Thanks for catch. I am not sure about using additional DOM wrapper, it is already pretty deep:) It also can be fixed by just adding <code>overflow-x: hidden</code> to html element.\n I've added overflow-x:hidden to html element in 0.6.2. This should be enough to avoid additional wrapping div. Closing this issue for now. But if this will produce any errors, reopen it\n  Did you test it? Try to set slow transition duration for pages and check, is box-shadow animating in this case? As i remember it had troubles with FF, and prev webkits. There was a bug with this because browser don't understand how it should be animated from \"none\" to \"0 0 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\"\n No, of course no old IEs) Only latest desktops, iOS and probably Androids because as i see many will use it as a web app. I mean that is there no problems with animating from \"none\" to \"0 0 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\" in these browsers?\n I just can't test it right now. If you approve that it is ok, i will merge it with a pleasure:)\n No, not only the edge version, just a few actual recent versions. iOS 6+ (Is already ok, except messages), recent versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera seems to be pretty ok. Don't know about IE and Android, can't test it at the moment. But because of F7 web usage, i think we should support them, of course 100% probably will not be possible because of performance and support issues (like on Android) but i think that F7 at least should be usable on these platforms\n Checked and seems to ok everywhere, thanks!\n  @ptb everything is correct.\nI will also add my explanation\n@rex \n1) Server is required for Ajax requests only, because Browser doesn't allow them from local file:// protocol. And of course it could be any HTTP server (Node, Ruby, Apache, etc.) About querying app, you actually shouldn't worry about, everything is required for dynamic loading of pages is already there. As @ptb said all you need is just a correct link to required HTML page. But of course if you need to do some custom Ajax calls, then you are free to use any lib you like.\n\n2) Also as @ptb answered it is just a native HTML, CSS and JS, so you can use it as a mobile website, webapp or wrap it with Phonegap to native app. But keep in mind that on the current stage it has some problems with support on none Webkit browsers and Android.\n Guys, thanks for your kind words. We can make it much much better together;) At the moment i really really need help with two things:\n- docs, i can write docs about JS api, but it is pretty problematic for me to describe HTML layout well, and its different combination, especially because English is not my native language:)\n- demo apps. We need ready to use demo apps, like local business app, travel app, hotel app, news app, company app, e-store app, etc. So developsers/users can have fast start with it, just download and start to restyle and fill up with their content\n Hey @xthilakx! \nDon't have such apps but you can search on appstore for apps of your largest local retailers. But i guess it should be simple:\n1) Page with product categories (list view/media list)\n2) Page with list of products in selected category (probably also media list with thumb, title, price)\n3) Page of single product, custom layout - photo, maybe like picture carousel (could be easily made with https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper), price, availability, description, add-to-cart button, product properties/tech spec\n4) Shopping cart page, also list view?:) with swipe-to-delete list elements to remove from cart\n5) Something like user settings page, where he can fill his personal and delivery data\n6) News and Offers pages - list of news and offers and detail page for each one\n7) And few static pages with info about Shop/Company (custom layout, simple text page), delivery terms & conditions, info about payment methods, contacts page (with google maps)\n I think i can close it for now because all docs are already released\n  Good catch, will add it today\n  Hey\nThanks, i know that it is highly required feature, but because F7 uses native scrolling it is not so simple to make it. But hopefully i'll release such feature on a week\n Any JS scroll will be not so cool as native one, and could produce a lot of problems. I want to realize it with native scrolling:)\n Ok, it is done, need to cleanup code a bit and hopefully will release it today\n Ok guys, it is there!:) Here is an updated live demo http://idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/ , look for appropriate link. And don't forget to clean cache\n Thanks guys, but i still see some issues. If page is long (with scrolling) that sometimes when we release it to refresh, page is blinking/flashing, do you see this? On iPhone it is rare but as see on iPad 2 it is really annoing\n Ok, it is fixed now. Seems like iOS bug, when we try to change opacity (like on arrow and preloader) during scrolling it does some kind of repaint that produce this blinking. Changing opacity to visibility seems to fix it\n @jeka5555 http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/pull-to-refresh.html\n  Thanks!\n  Thanks\n  This is a killer feature of iOS 7 ui, so we definitely need it:) \nAny thoughts on how realize it, perfectly with CSS only. \n\nI discovered pure CSS solution using CSS regions, it works perfect on desktop Safari, but super slow and buggy on iOS, so we need something different. \n\nIt is also possible do it with JS by duplicating content, but it is not an option because we will have a lot problems when we need to update content there (in duplicated layers)\n Here it is http://jsfiddle.net/3SyzN/11/ \nOpen in desktop Safari\n As you may see it looks pretty cool:) The same \"frosted\" bars are used everywhere on iOS. The problem in fiddle is that scrolling doesn't work on iOS. And if i add -webkit-overflow-scrolling to .page-blur-content then everything just disappear on mobile Safari))\n Closing for now as there is no good way to realize it at the moment\n Nice article, but you are right, it sounds like two impossible things :) But will see, i still hope that they stabilise css regions API in iOS 8, and it would be possible without a hassle\n  There is actually exist more beautiful solution in Less, we can show rules depending on arguments, on example of align-items:\n\n```\n.align-items(@ai) when (@ai = flex-start) {\n    -webkit-box-align: start;\n    -moz-box-align: start;\n    -ms-flex-align: start;\n    -webkit-align-items: flex-start;\n    align-items: flex-start;\n}\n.align-items(@ai) when (@ai = flex-end) {\n    -webkit-box-align: end;\n    -moz-box-align: end;\n    -ms-flex-align: end;\n    -webkit-align-items: flex-end;\n    align-items: flex-end;\n}\n.align-items(@ai) when not (@ai = flex-start) and not (@ai = flex-end) {\n    -webkit-box-align: @ai;\n    -moz-box-align: @ai;\n    -ms-flex-align: @ai;\n    -webkit-align-items: @ai;\n    align-items: @ai;\n}\n```\n But i am not sure that we should drop -moz-box syntax. Firefox start to support new syntax only about a year ago (in FF 20+). It is not so old. I know that F7 is of course mostly for iOS7, but as i see most will use it as a web app, where people can access with FF and mobile (Androids) FF where i not 100% sure it support latest syntax\n Didn't know that. Then sure, we should drop it, with such behavior it will be useless here:)\n Can you please make \"Add .box-shadow\" and \"Remove @-moz-keyframes\" with other PR so i can merge them separately? Or let me know if you going to rework flexbox mixins to what i suppose with \"when\" guard then i will wait, if no, i can change them by myself later\n No need to undo them, merged all together, thanks!\n  Merged, thanks\n  We need to get closer to iOS animation curves and durations, especially on transitions between pages. Anybody know where can we get correct values or how can we track it?\n Yep, as i remember i tried that and get super weird easing))\n @johnjamesjacoby you mean custom timing-functions? \n  Merged, thanks a lot!\n @ptb i just rearrange a bit navbar/toolbar with less padding on sides, but now it requires icon image to be the same size as icon element size. I mean now it is:\n![icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/2558649/22dbafb2-b753-11e3-88a3-103a3c4ec2b0.png)\nWe need this:\n![icon2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/2558651/3ee02422-b753-11e3-9dd3-404fb7b620b9.png)\n\nAt the moment i've managed it with background size, but don't think it is perfect solution. Could you please make back and bars SVG icons without extra space?\n Thanks:) By the way what software do you use for creating/drawing of SVG icons?\n  Try\n\n```\ndocument.location = 'http://google.com'\n```\n You probably mean that you need to change page dynamically. Then you need to call .loadPage method on created view. If you call it \"mainView\"  (when you used mainView = myApp.addView) then:\n\n```\nmainView.loadPage(urlHere)\n```\n  Hmm, looks good, but don't match to iOS one. Where you look at the source one? I relied to preloader that we can see in Mail app, just pull messages down to see it, here is screenshot:\n![preloader-example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/999588/2493611/fceafc5e-b29d-11e3-8623-bae9d562fea0.png)\nAnd here is your ones:\n![preloader svg](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/999588/2493616/29bf5572-b29e-11e3-872e-43216435b270.png)\n\nAs i see, size don't match (28px in iOS), the same with color (opacity), and animation not so smooth. Also as you see on iOS screenshot opacity between first and last bar are pretty linear and goes from 1 to 0, so the bar next to \"active\" is invisible:)\n Agh, i see you physically rotate it by steps, but with such approach we can't get smooth animation\n But Mail one looks the best:) Anyway, it is ok then, great work! ;). I just make it a little bit darker, cause it looks pretty transparent on page's grey background and inside of modal. I also set size to .preloader, and 100% to :after. So we don't need to touch :after and its bg size, just change size on preloader will enough\n What i am thinking, is it not confusing that by adding \"dark\" class to preloader it is actually white?) Maybe it will be more transparent if we call preloader for dark bg \".preloader-white\"?\n By the way, your SVG preloader looks really good on non-retina ipad/iPhone, previous css based was pretty choppy)\ud83d\udc4d\n No, i keep animation in :after, i mean that i set size to .preloader element and add to :after \"width:100%; height: 100%; background-size:100%\". In this case if need to change its size we can just change size of .preloader, no need to change size on :after and no need to change its background size :)\n  Merged, thanks!\n @ptb Could you please take a look at messages in iOS6. Do you know what happen?:)\n Yes, i am thinking about that too. I think anyway Framework need something like app.device object that will contain information about device, os, browser, etc. I will implement it on a days. And based on this internal lib i will add classes to HTML element like Modernizr do\n By the way, we need contra-versa logic here. Now you adding mask only when we in iOS7 only, but we need different, we need to remove mask when it is iOS6 only, because our SVG mask also looks good in desktop Safari, Chrome and also, i was surprised, but on Android 4.4 it is perfect too:)\n Why you use <code>:root</code> instead of <code>html</code>?

We have used a bit different technics with you, you add this \"tail\" as a colored SVG image, but i've tried to achieve something like mask. The problem with your technic is we can't add such tail to image. Images are already supported, you can try to  type this in message field and hit Send:\n\n```\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BixUKelCAAEX4qM.png\">\n```\n\nBut at the moment it has no \"tail\". With your technic we can't do that. So what i see now:\nYour pros:\n- we can easily colorize it\n- it don't depends on messages container background, so we can change it without problems\n\nYour cons:\n- Can't be applied to image\n- Paddings and border radius looks a bit over, but this probably easily configurable by changing SVG curve, right?\n\nMy pros:\n- potentially could be used with image, but we will need to use a lot of :after/:before pseudos\n- we can change background of message without changing inline SVG color, and we can use image backgrounds for messages\n\nMy cons:\n- png image looks not clear and smooth\n- by changing messages container background we also need to change this \"masks\"\n\nSo we need somehow to get the best from our solutions. I was thinking about using -webkit-mask with SVG masks, but i am not sure that it is possible\n\nWhat do you think:)\n About flex box. I think you mean fallback syntax for older browsers. Yes, please help!:) These flex-box differences drive me crazy)\n @ptb that is fantastic!) Exactly what we need, the only thing need to be fixed is a border radius. I mean when have for example one character in bubble, bubble should look like a circle\n Hmm, just checked, you are right, for some reason i was sure that they are round as circles:) Ok, so now they are perfect. Will you make a PR or you want me to merge it manually?\n Ok, by the way, could we unescape svg's url or it is required? I checked and seems to work fine, and it saves almost half size:)\n I agree, let's keep it unescaped and without base64\n Anyway, each bubble size is around just 200 bytes. Base64 will not help us a lot here, so let's keep it plain\n Looks great, right? I think you can pull it\n It is simple. We can't use &lt;p&gt; tag for a few reasons:\n1) It is a pretty common tag that dev probably will use in text/content formatting, and we always have some default styles for such tags in css like:\n\n```\np {\n  color:red;\n  font-size:20px;\n  margin: 1em 0;\n} \n```\n\nAnd the worst thing here is that many still use such things:\n\n```\np {\n  /* Hmm, for some reason color was not applied, let's do this important: */\n  color:red !important;\n  font-size:20px;\n} \n```\n\nAnd such thing could broke many things. And i guess no one will do such commong css rules for just &lt;div&gt; tags\nSo from this point usage of DIV tags is more safe.\n\n2) We can't put anything inside of P tag except inline elements. We do framework and we don't know what user will want to put there, it maybe UL list or few P tags inside. With P for bubbles it will not work. So using DIV tag also allows flexible layout inside of bubbles\n The same could happen with short classnames as \"sent\" or \"received\", and i sure that someone could use \"pic\" class in their custom layouts. So using such scoped classes is also more safe here\n I think we can close this issue for now\n  Yes, i know about it and it was there for a while. But it has strange buggy behavior, try for example, to add it in kitchen sink, load page in portrait orientation, then rotate device to landscape and scroll down. Do you see this strange huge white space under the app?\n \u0414\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438?) \u0412 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0441\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0448\u0430\u0444\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e, \u0441\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0434\u044b\u0440\u0430, \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0435\u0440 <body> \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445 \u0431\u0443\u0434 \u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445. minimal-ui \u0448\u0442\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u043e \u0431\u0430\u0433 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\n \u0414\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435, \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0436 \u043f\u043e\u0434 2 \u0442\u0443\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0438\u043d\u0442 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u044d\u0439\u0430\u0443\u0442, \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442))\n \u0411\u0440\u0435\u0434, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u0441\u0442, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e body, \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 scrollTop \u043d\u0430 -64px. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c scrollTop \u0443 body \u0432 0 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442\n \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0432 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u0447\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439 scrollTop \u0432 0\n  Ok, it is fixed in dev version.

Hi, I have a text box on a custom modal that I want to enable Android submit button on it, and I know this is available when wrapping the text box with a `<form>` element and adding a submit button, the native keyboard will interact with the form submitting event.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I have this custom modal that needs to click on the button to do a long code :\r\n\r\n```\r\n$$('.open-modal').on('click', function () {\r\n  myApp.modal({\r\n    title:  'Native submit test',\r\n    text: '<input type=\"text\">',\r\n    buttons: [\r\n      {\r\n        text: 'Submit',\r\n        onClick: function() {\r\n          myApp.alert('Submitted!');\r\n         // I have a very long code to do here <-----------[!]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  })\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried adding the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$$('.open-modal').on('click', function () {\r\n  myApp.modal({\r\n    title:  'Native submit test',\r\n    text: '<form method=\"post\" id=\"form\"><input type=\"text\"><input type=\"submit\"></form>',\r\n    buttons: [\r\n      {\r\n        text: 'Submit',\r\n        onClick: function() {\r\n          myApp.alert('Submitted!');\r\n         // I have a very long code to do here <-----------[!]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  })\r\n});\r\n\r\n$$(document).on('submit', '#form', function(e) {\r\n      e.PreventDefault();\r\n      //do the same very long code again  <-----------[!]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n![whatsapp image 2017-03-28 at 1 27 57 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17817239/24381540/7ce9d4b0-1359-11e7-999f-e08a44994db2.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in this way, I will have to do the long code twice, once in the form submitting function and the other in the onClick function of the modal button.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there is a better way to do this, as I can't add my code in a separated function.\r\n\r\nThanks.

Hi, I was looking for a way to know if the user is now in the main Index page after he gets back from other pages, so I tried `onPageAfterBack` and `onPageBack` to get the page name, but it seems they return the current page name not the target one.\r\n\r\nI need to fire up a function every time the user gets back again to the index page, as `onPageInit('index', ..` doesn't work for this.\r\n\r\nis there a way? Pretty sure `onPageInit` is only called when the page isn't in the cache, so you would need to use `onPageReinit`.\r\n\r\n`onPageBeforeAnimation` and `onPageAfterAnimation` would also work I think.\r\n\r\nHaven't actually tested this though... `OnPageReinit` and `onPageBeforeAnimation` actually worked, thanks.  This was asked several times, and you even gave a response here https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/530. I have also searched throughout the entire forum and found nothing that worked. I am using preprocess with Template7 data and I tried to call `mainView.router.refreshPage()`. This does not solve this issue, which is why I am wondering if there is a bug with the version I am using (1.5.2). I can post my coding example if necessary, but I'm really thinking it's a bug if this is not working correctly. Hey Zander, thank you so much for your response. I tried all of the 3 of these methods for callbacks on initial page with several different scenarios, but still no success somehow http://framework7.io/docs/page-callbacks.html#callbacks-for-initial-pages.

Thank you but I do not understand where to start. What means:\r\n\"First you need to have gulp-cli which you should install globally.\"\r\nWhere I can find \"gulp-cli\" ? Also, what means \"Then install all dependencies, in repo's root\"\r\nI have 10+ years experience in Windows desktop programming (Visual Basic) and I just started on HTML/JS world so those instructions are strange to me. If there is no chance that someone post compiled version with Data Table, I will wait. I just asked - if someone built it already to post it somewhere.. Yes I am. I have installed it into C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\ and there is node.exe and some other files. When I run node.exe it show me DOS command prompt and that's all. I searched for \"gulp\" and there is no such file. How to start? Look, if it is problem for you or someone to build data table, I will wait. I will not to disturb you or someone else if you have no time to build it.. I just asked if someone already did that - if not, OK.

I've pulled the latest down from master and can't reproduce on Chrome or Safari.  I'm currently developing a web app and I've run into an issue trying to implement the F7 swiper. If I insert the swiper to the home page it works fine but when I insert it into one of the tabs it becomes glichy and doesn't slide as it should. \r\n\r\nOn the docs it says \"Note that Swiper container should be in DOM on a moment of initialization. So if you use slider not on home page, you need to initialize it within page:init event\". I've tried doing this and the event is not being triggered. I've tried the event for all pages and also for each page and neither is being triggered.\r\n\r\n### What I did\r\n```\r\n$$(document).on('page:init', function(e) {\r\n    console.log('Event triggered');\r\n });\r\n\r\n$$(document).on('page:init', '.page[data-page=\"about\"]', function (e) {\r\n    console.log('Event triggered');\r\n});  \r\n```\r\n\r\n  Fix error _\"Unable to get property 'split' of undefined or null reference framework7.js (13461,17)\"_ if using the device detection on windows phones.  Hi there,\r\n\r\nIm currently developing a project using Framework7 and it is actually at the very first stage. I have implemented a [login-screen modal-in] view along with the main view in my index.html page (to handle the Login screen)\r\n\r\nEverything works fine actually, the first screen that pops up is the login screen as expected, and as soon as I click on login it pops down and the index screen (main) shows up.\r\n\r\nI've noticed a strange behavior which is, as soon as the index page is loaded, if I click on the home button (which is a link with href to the index.html page) it performs the ajax call to the index.html page even though it is actually the page that is currently being displayed.\r\n\r\nI've been reading some articles here and could be something to do with the framework initialization, perhaps I've tried the proposed hints and could not overcome this issue.\r\n\r\nObs.: If I click on another link, which will refer to another page, then go back to index page I can click as many times as I want that the ajax won't reload it.\r\n\r\nMy index.html and app.js are attached.\r\n\r\n[index.html.txt](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/files/855902/index.html.txt)\r\n[app.js.txt](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/files/855904/app.js.txt)\r\n\r\nFramework version is v1.5.3\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need more details.\r\nAny help is more than appreciated.\r\nBR,\r\nGui It would be more useful if you would show a sketch of what you want to apply Well,\r\n\r\nI guess it's more like what I want to avoid. Need to understand why at the first time the index.html page is loaded, if I click on the option that will refer to itself, it recalls the same page while next times I click it won't.\r\n\r\nPlease check the code for further details. I think this is because Framework7 is using the full URL of the page to identify it.\r\n\r\nSo when you first load your app the page it's on is `http://path.to/page/index.html` and when you click your link with `href=\"index.html\"` the new page is just `index.html` with no path. Since the url (`index.html`) doesn't match the original page url (`http://path.to/page/index.html`) it makes a request to the page.\r\n\r\nQuick test of this:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozgnowj--MA\r\n\r\nSo the easiest fix would be to just replace your index button with a full path link. Thanks @jdf221 your solution works (not really charming) more like a workaround. This situation I think it's really linked with this thread https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/28#ref-commit-4c47ac5\r\n\r\nI tried initiating the API manually perhaps I get the error that $$ is not a function.\r\n\r\nWould this might have changed again in latest releases (regression bug) ?

Neither in device API nor support API I found something. For example, IE 11 does not support Web Apps, Google Chrome does it well. So there should be any variable with true/false to use and show alerts according the status. Regards, Dennis @ZanderBrown - If I open an Framework7 app in IE 11, I have a black page with small grey menu on top - but no more. Open the same in Chrome, there is no issue. Dennis @ZanderBrown - Please find attached my result for Internet Explorer 11.0.9600 on Windows 7\r\n\r\n![screenshot 001](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19615586/24146412/e429c17c-0e35-11e7-9501-cadaf1b2d71b.png)\r\n Thank @nolimits4web - Did you test on IE 11 - or, should it even work in IE 11?  This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* Framework7 Version: 1.5.3.\r\n* Platform and Target: IOS\r\n\r\nIn photobrowser when multiple images are presented, try to manually zoom in on any single image. While image is zoomed in, try to pan the image [move it to right or left] and the whole page would instead slide to right or left instead of the expected behavior.  This bug appeared for me on IOS. I don't have an Android device currently to confirm whether it also happen on Android. Best example is the photobrowser component in the kitchen sink at http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-ios/ No, I don't mean the swipe back functionality. Also, the problem occurs in Cordova, not in any browsing app.\r\n\r\nWhen the picture is zoomed in, try to swipe/pan the image to view the different hidden portions of the zoomed in image and you will notice that instead of the picture moving, the whole page slides to the right or the left.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm unable to reproduce the problem on my iPhone right now.  This problem was definitely occurring yesterday. I'll report back and come once I can reproduce it. @nolimits4web Please view the video at the following link. The problem appears at the end of the video. Please note how an attempt to pan the image is made but photobrowser slides the whole page instead.\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6B6qgK4e41XckdtY214TnBYSUE/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThe problem appears randomly, but sometimes it appears a lot and it's very annoying.

Also you can manually scroll the tabs to jump to a new one etc... Please see below.\r\n\r\n![videotogif_2017 03 17_11 38 34](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1933841/24051222/da2c5b16-0b07-11e7-8237-cbe9fe5e6b07.gif)\r\n\r\nCurrently the tabs always try and justify into one width no matter how many you have. I can imagine this is a bit of a brain ache to figure out. Would need some kind of minimal width flag perhaps before tabs overflow.\r\n\r\nThis would be really awesome feature to have and adds great user experience. Doesn't need to just be for material theme.\r\n\r\nCheers @nolimits4web \r\nNice feature :)  @ZanderBrown can we label this iOS Theme too? This featured shouldn't just be for the material theme if possible. This is what YouTube currently have on their iOS version. I admit it is a custom implementation but if the component is built we should be able to use it and style it how we deem fit on both themes. It is a very handy UI feature.\r\n\r\n![videotogif_2017 03 22_08 16 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1933841/24197521/55e49dda-0ed8-11e7-89a8-facd8b05704c.gif)\r\n\r\nThe current kitchen sink versions are here for reference. \r\n\r\n![current_swipeable](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1933841/24198055/8efb72d6-0eda-11e7-8acf-d903a1fa12de.jpg)\r\n I am not saying it should look that that example as yes that would not match the iOS theme at all. Just implying that even top companies deem it a worthy UI feature across both iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nAn idea for the iOS theme tabs could be to scroll the tabs within the bordered grouped button container perhaps. Half showing one tab would indicate more and as the user wipes left or right they will see them animate etc.  This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n**Unable to switch**\r\n* Framework7 Version: EXACT RELEASE VERSION OR COMMIT HASH, HERE.\r\n* Platform and Target: PLATFORM CLIENT YOU ARE TARGETING SUCH AS CORDOVA, IOS, ANDROID, ETC.\r\n* Live Link or JSFiddle/Codepen: PREFERABLY _(IF YOU WANT YOUR ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED ASAP)_.

If I select 3-10-2017, the `onDayClick` function returns 2-10-2017\r\n\r\n Thanks for the response.\r\nFor anyone else who runs into the same issue, the date can be adjusted with momentjs:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n      onDayClick: function (p, dayContainer, year, month, day) {\r\n        console.log(moment([year, month, day]).month(month).format(\"LLL\"))\r\n      }\r\n```  The idea is to create a Timeline having the date and some text as input using a form. Now save this Detail in the local storage and display the same in time line. \r\nCan anyone guide me as how I can achieve that. A code piece example will be more than useful. @nolimits4web \r\nA virtual list timeline would be great :)  ```\r\n<ul>\r\n    <!-- Text inputs -->\r\n    <li>\r\n      <div class=\"item-content\">\r\n        <div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon f7-icons\">compose</i></div>\r\n        <div class=\"item-inner\">\r\n          <div class=\"item-input\">\r\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"title\" placeholder=\"Title\">\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <div class=\"item-content\">\r\n        <div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon f7-icons\">document_fill</i></div>\r\n        <div class=\"item-inner\">\r\n          <div class=\"item-input\">\r\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"achievement\" placeholder=\"Describe\">\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </li> \r\n    <!-- Date -->\r\n    <li>\r\n      <div class=\"item-content\">\r\n        <div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon f7-icons\">calendar</i></div>\r\n        <div class=\"item-inner\">\r\n          <div class=\"item-input\">\r\n            <input type=\"date\" name=\"date\" placeholder=\"Birth day\" value=\"2014-04-30\">\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  </form>\r\n  <div class=\"content-block\">\r\n  <p><a href=\"#\" class=\"button get-storage-data\">Get Data</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nJS Code-\r\n```\r\nvar $$ = Dom7;\r\nvar arr = [];\r\n\r\n$$('.get-storage-data').on('click', function() {\r\n\t\r\n  var storedData = myApp.formGetData('my-form');\r\n  arr.push(storedData);\r\n  console.log(arr.length);\r\n // var title = [];\r\n for(var i = 0; i<arr.length;i++){\r\n  //if(storedData) {\r\n    //alert(JSON.stringify(storedData));\r\n\t\t\tlocalStorage.setItem(arr[i],JSON.stringify(storedData));\r\n  //}\r\n  //else {\r\n    //alert('There is no stored data for this form yet.

Can anyone suggest what changes can be made ?  It is sometimes really useful to detect when an image has been loaded via lazy load.\r\n\r\nThis adds this functionality.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\r\n     onLazyLoad: function (el) {\r\n          console.log(el.attr('data-src'));\r\n     }\r\n});\r\n``` I did think that but from testing the following just never gets called. Perhaps a timing thing?\r\n\r\nNote* my pages are Ajax loaded hence the need for $$(document).on to support newly added content.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myApp = new Framework7({});\r\n\r\n$$(document).on('lazy', 'img', function () {\r\n    console.log('Image Loaded');\r\n    console.log($$(this));\r\n});\r\n``` I am a fan of a callback function defined in the initialization. But I agree no need to edit the core if there is an event we can listen for. But I just can't get it to work. Correct me if I am wrong, but if I moved the code I added into onLoad() function it would fire when the image has actually fully loaded which is very beneficial in some cases. (slow connections)\r\n\r\nListening to the 'lazy' event would fire before the image has fully loaded? Perfect cheers!

Version: february\r\n* Platform and Target: desktop browser, both safari and chrome\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nGoing 3 levels deep, then swiping back 3 times back to main view. The main view is displayed with a black area on the right side. It seems to have an extra class that should not be there: page-on-left.\r\nPS I am using domCache:true at each view instance. \r\nWhen using the back button instead of swipe back, everything is normal.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nShould not have black area on right side. \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nBlack area on right side. The div data-page has a class called page-on-left. When I remove this class, the black area disappears.\r\n Maybe you are suffering the same: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/1338 It happens even with 2 levels deep page (without swipe) navigation. To reproduce: just go to the second page and click back to the first page very quickly, repeat few times, you will get black area on right side. I too see an extra \"page-on-left\" on the first page when the black area appears on the right.\r\nI am using domCache:true\r\n\r\nThe workaround I did was to delay the level2 page rendering a little bit, it seemed to work. But it's a hack. Need a fix.\r\n\r\n  setTimeout(function() {\r\n    myview.router.load({\r\n      pageName: \"level2-page\",\r\n    });\r\n  }, 70);\r\n\r\nI am on mobile browser (cordova). When using the swipe back and 3 levels deep, I always get the black area. It happens every time.\r\nI will try the workaround. A proper bug fix, would be the best solution though.  Hi Guys, I've found a bug in inline Datepicker, using your kitchen example for android material.-\r\nIf you click on a day, it select another next to the one clicked.\r\n\r\n Hi!

In fact Ive released this app using Cordova and Framework7. But, trying the same app on an Android Emuluator or even device is yielding unexpected/broken behavior. Ive elaborated a bit more on SO before I realized that I probably should post it here. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42749797/framework7-popup-or-page-with-dynamic-content-does-not-work-on-android\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nExpected behavior is that dynamic popup and pages should act same on Android, i.e. open/load.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nNothing happens from what I can see. E.g. I do enter the code where the popup is created but it does not seem to fire.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to resolving this. Thanks. iOS theme. Do you think that is the cause? Didn't think theme could be the cause either but its tricky to tell sometimes. So, I assume you've not come across this before? I've at least not found references to issues such as this. Sure. Game as webapp can be played here, http://34.250.179.3/ (just make sure to set your browser to emulate phone/tablet) or downloaded from app store https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/push-penguin/id1210906366?mt=8.\r\n\r\nSample of a page that works on iPhone and web (Chrome) but not on Android device:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nvar userHTML =\r\n    '<div class=\"view\">' +\r\n    '<div class=\"pages\">' +\r\n    '<div data-page=\"user\" class=\"page navbar-fixed toolbar-fixed\">' +\r\n    header +\r\n    '<div class=\"page-content\">' +\r\n    '<div class=\"content-block\">'+\r\n    '<div class=\"list-block inset\">' +\r\n    '<ul>' +\r\n    '<li>' +\r\n    '<div class=\"item-content\">' +\r\n    '<div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon f7-icons\">person</i></div>' +\r\n    '<div class=\"item-inner\">' +\r\n    '<div class=\"item-input\">' +\r\n    '<p style=\"margin:0; padding:0;\">' +\r\n    userInfo[\"username\"] +\r\n    '</p>' +\r\n    '</div>' +\r\n    '</div>' +\r\n    '</div>' +\r\n    '</li>' +\r\n    '</ul>' +\r\n    '</div>' +\r\n    user1to5Place +\r\n    myPosition +\r\n    '</div>'+\r\n    '</div>'+\r\n    footer +\r\n    '</div>' +\r\n    '</div>' +\r\n    '</div>';\r\n\r\n     mainView.router.load({\r\n    content: userHTML,\r\n    animatePages: true\r\n     });\r\n```\r\nWhere e.g. the header variable is constructed as such:\r\n```\r\nfunction userPageHeaderFunction() {\r\n    var header =\r\n\t'<div class=\"navbar\">' + \r\n\t'<div class=\"navbar-inner\">' +\r\n\t'<div class=\"left\">' +\r\n\t'<a href=\"\" class=\"navbarGear\">' +\r\n\t'<i class=\"f7-icons\">gear</i>' +\r\n\t'</a>' +\r\n\t'</div>' +\r\n\t'<div class=\"center\">Me & I</div>' +\r\n\t'<div class=\"right\">' +\r\n\t'<a href=\"\" class=\"navbarIcon\">' +\r\n\t'<i class=\"f7-icons\">info</i>' +\r\n\t'</a>' +\r\n\t'</div>' +\r\n\t'</div>' +\r\n\t'</div>';\r\n    return header;\r\n}\r\n``` Hmm, several things seem a bit shaky moving over to Android dev compared to iOS here. The welcomescreen plugin fires a bit randomly, the admob ad dismiss also closes open popup in the background and the animation is significantly more laggy. Is it simply a bit more tricky to get things to work on Android than on iOS? Ive previously used Cordova with goratchet but dont remember it being such a leap to get Android up and running. Any tips on what I may be doing wrong? Or is simply Framework7 \"better\"/easier towards iOS?    Hi, sorry, seems its a programming bug from my end! Was disguised under a gradle issue on Android Studio under path issue on Android under findIndex (which works on Safari but not on Chrome mobile). The really really tricky thing here is that it worked sometimes, very confusing. Im still not \"done\" but I dont think it has anything to do with Framework7 at this point.

Copying the CSS will result in losing the previous styling I made.\r\nIsn't there anything else I need to do? I also tried it, but still not working. I've the same problem but it's not very often. \r\nDon't know when and why It's in the boilerplate too if you enable push state.  Could you elaborate please? Closing this issue as there was no support yet, and seems like I'm gonna have to search for an alternative way to make that back button works.\r\nThanks anyways. I didn't mean it this way, and I truly appreciate what you're doing guys, and I'm not even allowed to judge!\r\n\r\nMy point is that I have to figure out a solution asap, and I don't have the right to bother you and ask you for it, so I decided to look around hopefully I might be able to fix it.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding @nolimits4web 's message, can you explain it please? I'm new here, I haven't build mobile apps before, this is my first time using F7, and I adore how it makes it easier for us to make a stunning mobile app.\r\n\r\nThe popup, and the login screen are in the index file, right after the closing tag of the page-content, where shall I put them?\r\n\r\nAnd how is that affecting the back navigation after going to the third page?\r\n\r\nSorry again. Thank you so much! It's not an issue at all, it was my bad!\r\nSorry again and thank you so so much!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nIt's working perfectly! And why is the bug in the kitchen sink too? \r\nI can't be the layout  @nolimits4web \r\nOnly with push state and navigation with browser back button.  I can make a video   I am able to select the dropdown of autocomplete. But that selected element is not rendering in input.\r\nMay i know the reason? May i get your attention? Please @edukondalu123 please follow the issue template and you will get a better response.  \r\nHi i want remove bounce overscroll effect in ios (On android this does not happen)\r\n\r\nI have another project in my ios using materalizecss And it does not have that effect.\r\n\r\nI believe it's something in css but I did not find anything related in the files.\r\n\r\nIf I remove this part of the project \r\n\r\nlink rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/framework7.ios.css\"\r\n\r\nit loses all the styles and continues with the scroll and the bounce effect disappears Inobounce no work 100% What I mean is that I do not think the bouce effect is native to ios, as I said earlier I have other projects running on ios that do not appear in the bouce effect  Hi,\r\nI'm using Framework7 & AngularJS for my seed application.\r\nashvin777/framework7.angular using this I'm able to build application using Angularjs & Framework7.\r\nIn my application,  I want to create a layout of Anonymous users and Authenticated users.\r\n(I'm not using any Inline-views, all views are from ajax calls.)\r\nFor anonymous users, index.html has main view, when user get authenticated successfully, I need to make dashboard.html as my main view.\r\nHow can I dynamically initialize Framework7 main view ?\r\n\r\nCould any one help me out in fixing the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPhaneendra\r\n\r\n  when I use Smart Select on Chrome\r\ncode:   \r\n            function watchChangeState(e) {\r\n                /*jshint validthis:true*/\r\n                var i = $(this), value = i.val();\r\n                var type = i.attr('type');\r\n                if (notInputs.indexOf(type) >= 0) return;\r\n                var els = i.add(i.parents('.item-input, .input-field')).add(i.parents('.item-inner').eq(0));\r\n                if (value && value.trim() !== '') {\r\n                    els.addClass('not-empty-state');\r\n                }\r\n                else {\r\n                    els.removeClass('not-empty-state');\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\nerror:\r\nframework7.js:8301   Uncaught TypeError: value.trim is not a function js Fiddle:/dist/js/material-inputs.js\r\nhttp://material.framework7.cn/   \r\nthen open Form->Smart Select\r\nwhen select car option, you will see the bug.\r\nThe interesting thing is that if iOS doesn't happen Yeah, this is reproducible. The `watchChangeState` function is getting called twice. The first time it fires `value` is a string to `trim` works then the second time `value` is an array where `trim` does not exist. @ZanderBrown yeah confirmed. The hack would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (value && value.trim && value.trim() !== '') {\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I don't understand why it fires twice so far and now I'm off to lunch and will probably forget about everything. Have you committed the fix?  * [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* Framework7 Version: 1.5.3\r\n* Platform and Target: in Browser\r\n* Live Link or JSFiddle/Codepen: -Nil-\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nI have Website(for mobile) with 7 pages. When i click main menu to go another page, in my Browser URL is like this (http://localhost/index.php#!/about.php) or (http://localhost/index.php#!/services.php) and i have pageInit functions for each pages.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe website loaded with index.php and my url is (http://localhost/index.php).\r\nI click About Us (http://localhost/index.php#!/about.php)\r\nthen i click Services (http://localhost/index.php#!/services.php)\r\nthen i click Contact Us (http://localhost/index.php#!/contact.php)\r\n\r\nevery thing Working Fine, Now i am in Contact Us page, and if i click Browser Back Button, its showing the content(html) of services.php in browser. Now it should trigger page init function for services.php.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nBut instead Trigger Services page's Page Init function, its trigger about page init function. Yes, they have unique data-page values. i have tried with this also.\r\n\r\nHome -> Services -> Contact Us -> About Us, Now if i click Back, Contact Us Page showing, but Services page Init event is triggering. http://f7.hyperlinkinfotech.com/ I have uploaded for you with simple navigation. please have a look. Before you test, Please Open your Browser Console. because i have added console.log() on pageInit events.\r\n\r\n**index.php**\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui\">\r\n    <meta name=\"mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\">\r\n    <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\">\r\n    <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style\" content=\"black\">\r\n    <meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#2196f3\">\r\n\r\n    <title>Framework 7 Test -

Instead its trigger About Page and loading its Content.\r\n\r\nHow this is as Feature???\r\n\r\nor Atleast it should not trigger About Us page Init Function while we use Browser Back button. @ZanderBrown After spending many hour i found one thing When i click Browser Back button `app.router.back` & `app.router._back` functions are triggering twice, check the console now (http://f7.hyperlinkinfotech.com/)\r\n\r\nAnd Browser's Forward Button its working perfect.  This allows us to rerender the page with other data.\r\nHelpful if the data has changed. With this you can easily rerender the page and musn't reinit the complete page nor change any data manually with .html()\r\n\r\nSee: #751 (I've updated it to be ready to merge) Okay then I'll close it.   Fixed the bug with the morph to popover animation for Chrome on Android.\r\nFixes these issues: #1088 , #885 \r\n\r\nTake a look at my old request: #1155  @nolimits4web @valnub @ZanderBrown \r\nAnyone can review and merge this?  Okay let's see. \r\nI ask because there are other open merge requests which are very old and noone cares.  Zander and me usually just review PRs but we do not merge them. @nolimits4web has to do that if he decides that it's worth it since he is the repo owner. Unfortunately he cannot dedicate all of his time to this, since he also has work to do for living. If you want to support, feel free to donate via Patreon and he will have more time to care for F7: https://www.patreon.com/vladimirkharlampidi @nolimits4web \r\nThe look & feel is nearly the same but the animation will be much smoother then. @nolimits4web \r\nI've tested it again with the newest Chrome Beta (Google improved the 3D engine) and now it's smooth as hell!\r\nNo need to fix/merge this.  Hi, I need to append the RTL style without reloading the page, I use:\r\n\r\n`$$('head').append(\"<link rel='stylesheet' id='rtl-style' href='http://mywebsite.com/css/f7.rtl.min.css' type='text/css'>\");`\r\n\r\nBut a lot of problems appear with animations between tabs and on search bar and so on.. I tried using `myApp.init()` and `myApp.params.rtl = true` after appending the style but it didn't help, how do I tell F7 that I did append the RTL style to interact with it?\r\n\r\nThanks. I tried `myApp.rtl = true` and saw it changed in the developer toolbox DOM viewer, now page animations and tabs direction are good, but search bar still adds `margin-left` to the `Cancel` button instead of `right` (as example). maybe there is another parameter I should change too?\r\n\r\nWhen RTL style added on page load:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-03 at 12 02 08 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17817239/23544795/192676ba-0001-11e7-9406-3f7597a02dbe.png)\r\n\r\nWhen RTL added dynamically and triggered `myApp.rtl = true`:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-03 at 12 02 53 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17817239/23544802/1ced1ca4-0001-11e7-8cc5-59f4b598c735.png)\r\n  Adding in a .editorconfig file to cut down on issues when indenting and trailing whitespace when accepting PR's from other devs. Should make it easier to review PR's in the future. @ZanderBrown this many: http://editorconfig.org/#download Love this a lot !

I also see another problem in the date picker. When I click on a day, it will not always select the day (nothing happens). Sometimes I have to click multiple times on a day and then it will select it. I remember that someone posted about a change in Google Chrome that breaks clicking behavior in F7. Don't remember that post tho. This problem does not exist in other browsers, e.g. Firefox. Other users also reported similar issues with components not always reacting when clicked. I can reproduce it as well but I haven't discovered what the magic combination is. The first few date ranges I select work fine then eventually the date range stops highlighting the last day. Was about to post about this issue, Happens for me on windows 7 64bits, chrome 56.0.2924.87 and on firefox 51.0.1. Also I can reproduce it on iPad pro v10.2 & a Samsung Note 5 running android 6.0.1\r\n Try a range from 15 to 31 march 2016 or october 2016. My environment:\r\n- http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/\r\n- Chrome 56.0.2924.87 (64-bit)\r\n- macOS 10.12.3\r\n- No emulator\r\n\r\nMake sure to follow the steps exactly:\r\n1. Open kitchen sink (Material)\r\n2. Select Calendar\r\n3. Scroll down to select range\r\n4. Click on 15\r\n6. Click on 30 This seems to affect march and october only I think I found the cause: whenever daylight saving dates are in the selected range the issue happens. \ud83d\ude02 That would be funky but sounds plausible since Vladi is in Russia. Do you have daylight saving time over there? OMG! Another thing we can blame on daylight savings time.

Very weird, seems to be a WebView engine rendering issue. If I remember correctly there is an option to switch to a different WebView engine which behaves more similar to Safari but I don't remember how it was called.\r\n\r\nMaybe @macdonst knows something as this is Cordova-related? Also, I think the problem might be because Swiper has to calculate the size of the image being displayed based on the space available. If this space has not expanded yet, it will calculate the wrong size. That might be the reason why lazyloading option helps because it will do the calculation later when the correct parent width/height is available.\r\n\r\nJust a guess tho @valnub I have lazy loading Active but I still have the same problem.\r\nYou are right about it is Cordova problem as I don't see the issue on CrossWalk webView on Android, the advanced webView for Cordova on iOS \"WKWebView\" was having a bug and I couldn't test it, seems they finally made a fix 5 days ago and I will try checking this with the WKWebView engine.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine I don't remember if this relates to Cordova but I heard from others that it's possible to switch from UIWebViewController to SFSafariViewController if this is the problem. @valnub I'm already using SFSafariViewController in the example video I'm showing above.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-07 at 8 30 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17817239/23669430/ceaf6b86-036c-11e7-90ad-7851a85c6781.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller\r\n\r\n`A nicer / cleaner UI which is consistent with Safari and all other apps using a SFSafariViewController.`\r\n\r\n @valnub Maybe just adding the same lazy calculation to non-lazy images will solve the problem?\r\nThanks I rather think that it needs to be waited until the parent container has fully expanded to its final width/height and then render the image. I'm also suffering from the mentioned bug. I am using WKWebview by the way.

This issue applies to all autocomplete fields, but I use the Language field as an example.\r\n* If I position the field at the top of the screen, the dropdown appears correctly (please see 1.jpg and 2.jpg attached).\r\n* However, if I position the field at the middle or bottom of the screen (which causes the entire screen to be pushed up after tapping the field - i.e. keyboard appears from the bottom of the screen), the dropdown appears far below the field - below POPUP STANDALONE AUTOCOMPLETE (please see 3.jpg, 4.jpg and 5.jpg attached).\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nDropdown appears right below the Language field.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nDropdown appears far below the Language field - below POPUP STANDALONE AUTOCOMPLETE.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nThis issue seems to be specific to Cordova iOS (tested using PhoneGap developer app). I can't recreate the issue on Cordova Android nor browsers in various different platforms. Upon further investigation, it seems that the offset() function called in positionDropDown() returns unexpected \"top\" if the page got pushed up because of the keyboard appearing (only under PhoneGap developer app in iOS). The offset() function also returns other unexpected \"top\" for landscape layout (i.e. different pattern from portrait layout). Please let me know if I can help you further.\r\n\r\n1.jpg\r\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1920298/23447989/9a3fee26-fea2-11e6-84a5-9e23ceb998ba.jpg)\r\n2.jpg\r\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1920298/23447988/9a3f3cec-fea2-11e6-8448-15dd5a4356de.jpg)\r\n\r\n3.jpg\r\n![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1920298/23447990/9a404808-fea2-11e6-847d-48c91ca2c51b.jpg)\r\n4.jpg\r\n![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1920298/23447986/9a3eb59c-fea2-11e6-9138-7a64ff41e58c.jpg)\r\n5.jpg\r\n![5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1920298/23447987/9a3f182a-fea2-11e6-80bd-9afefc10d5ca.jpg) Hi @ZanderBrown ,\r\nI think it's different as the .page-content class is present in dropdown, but the offset() calculation is not correct. @ZanderBrown You're right :) @kurni can you reproduce this in cordova-ios but not in the PhoneGap Developer app? I would like to rule out that the Dev app as the root cause. If it is a dev app issue we can handle it over on it's repo. @macdonst Yes, I can reproduce this issue in the resulting compiled ios app if that's what you mean.

If an li in a sortable's ul contains li elements within, sortable tries to sort the parent li (or a different li entirely) within the child li. Fixes bug by only looking one level down for li elements.

I've written a small app in vuejs and framework7 (directly, without framework7-vuejs).\r\nIt was working fine, until I've upgraded to 1.5.0/1.5.2. Since then the showPreloader(), picker and all modals in general don't seem to work anymore!\r\nAny idea what could have happened? \r\n\r\nNote: I've reverted back to 1.4.2 and everything is back working fine!  Yes, better use official framework7-vue lib response? still waiting for a reason why it's broken\r\nof course there's framework7-vue, but that doesn't answer the original question\r\n\r\nps: just to clarify, framework7-vue works fine, but in some circumstances it's too limited vs the original How do you think F7-vue is limited? Maybe we can use your feedback to improve it. zanderbrown: you are right, I'll try to replicate on jsfiddle\r\nvalnub: well any slightly complex mix of functionalities ... for example virtual list + swipeout elements + infinite scroll is giving me some headache (ie swipeout events handling); ps don't get me wrong, it's a great effort as I'm an avid vuejs fan here's the test code: https://github.com/xdadda/testapp\r\nif I use framework7 1.4.2 then an alert box will be displayed at startup (see component Home.vue, mounted() hook)\r\nif I upgrade framework7 no alertbox (or any other modal) is displayed\r\n\r\ncan't figure it out I ran your app but there is no alert box popping up at startup although F7 1.4.2 is used. There must be an error somewhere else in your code. valnub: ehm ... my code doesn't use F7 1.4.2\r\nto use 1.4.2 you need to change package.json from \"framework7\": \"^1.4.2\" to \"framework7\": \"1.4.2\"\r\n  I don't know if this bug is related to Framework7, but I consider you shoud know about it.\r\n\r\nThis is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* Framework7 Version: 1.5.3.\r\n* Platform and Target: Cordova iOS (UIWebView), iOS Theme.\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nWhen I change too fast between pages (ajax pages), sometimes (it is totally random for what I see) the entire WebView it becomes frozen.\r\n\r\nWhile I was debugging, I found the UIWebview throw an Exception.\r\n\r\nI post the link about that and includes a potencial fix, but I'm not sure if the issue is completely solved.\r\n[The link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25894173/uiwebview-throwing-exception-for-webactiondisablingcalayerdelegate-setbeingremo)\r\n\r\nThe changes I did, which I found from the link I posted, are:\r\n\r\nIn the style of body, I added this line: **-webkit-transform:translateZ(0px);**\r\n\r\nI hope this can be helpful for somebody.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention and for this great framework.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n Hi, can you tell us more about your dev environment?

It seems to work.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCristian I create a Cordova app with iOS theme. \r\nI would like to upload a recording showing the bug, but I still cannot reproduce it exactly because it's a random bug and it's happening in a different pages. I'll keep trying to record it and if i succed I'll post here.\r\n\r\nThe facts I recognized when I was debugging are:\r\n - If the UIWebview is\"freeze\" and I change the orientation on device then it work again\r\n - Even the UIWebview is\"freeze\", the javascript still working, this is because I throw an alert and it appears, and if i trigger the clicks from javascript still working.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention Hi, based on this information it is very hard to find out what's going on. I recommend to create a codepen example and try to make the bug **_reproducible_** so it can be debugged. Yeah, if we can get a reproduction scenario and it is a Cordova problem we can get it fixed.

We tried with _blank, _system and only URL, but I couldn't get it to run. @ZanderBrown  Solved the issue using InApp Browser Plugin. In JS have mentioned the device On Ready function and in the button Href tag, have opened the URL with window.open and keeping target as blank.

Navigate to Framework7 Kitchen sink example\r\n2. Click Pull to Refresh\r\n3. Pulling down the page and new value is added (Total list is 4)\r\n4. Click Back (Not the browser's back)\r\n5. Click Pull to Refresh again\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI expect the old page with the 4 list to be cached and loaded again when I re-click the Pull to Refresh button\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe Pull to Refresh was back to it original state with 3 list.\r\nI have tried to modify the kitchen-sink.js like this, but it's doesn't work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\r\n    modalTitle: 'Framework7',\r\n    swipePanel: 'both',\r\n    material: true,\r\n    pushState: true,\r\n    reload: true, //I changed this to false but still doesn't work\r\n    reloadPrevious: true,\r\n    force: false,\r\n    ignoreCache: false,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n It doesn't work, when I go to Pull to Refresh page it still reset to default value, my alternative way is making a page as popup element in the index.html\r\nBut, it will make my index.html more bigger and more complex..\r\n\r\nThe problem is just same when I fill value on Forms->Form Elements, go back and open again.. F7 doesn't have any built-in data storage, you should use your own implementation (DB, FireBase, LocalStorage, etc.) what is fit best for you and your app  how can i use search bar autocomplete extender for asp.net web application ?\r\ni tried to use that search-bar with AJAX Autocomplete Extender,but it is not displaying any results.\r\nso if you have any solution please let me know.I'll be grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks hello,\r\ni have query displaying DIV in different devices.\r\nso is there any css class in framework7 that will hide my DIV in Desktop and display in Mobile view ?\r\n\r\nthanks  Looks good, but can you somehow revert commits to `dist/` files?  This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* Framework7 Version: 1.53.\r\n* Platform and Target: IOS and Android\r\n\r\nI'm attempting to focus on the search input field in the standalone autocomplete component so that the user can start typing right away as soon as autocomplete page opens without having to tap on the search input field. \r\n\r\nTo implement the above, I attempted to use the following when the autocomplete is defined. \r\n\r\nonOpen: function (autocomplete, value) {\r\n\t\t$(autocomplete.page).find(\"input[type=search]\").focus();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThe above code works. However, it seems that the input is focused before the page animation is complete. This results in having a half empty page with black background when standalone finishes the opening animation. \r\n\r\nPossible solutions to the above are:\r\n- Have a custom callback function \"afterOpened\" which is called after the page finishes the animation. I would then place the above code inside 'afterOpened' instead of 'onOpen'.\r\n- have an option to open standalone autocomplete without animation (not the best, but should work) Thanks. However, is the animation time always fixed among all devices on IOS and Android ??\r\n(60ms as in the timeout function you provided ) It works for Android, but not for IOS. The problem is with the keyboard not opening. I remember I had a similar problem in the past. The only solution I could find was by disabling the animation for popups using CSS. This allowed me to focus on search input field in the opened page/popup which opens without any animation.\r\n\r\nAgain, it would be nice if F7 has native support for autofocus which works on both IOS and Android AND triggers the keyboard to open on both platforms. That's great. Thanks. Do the modifications you made apply to both 'page' and 'popup' ? Are the pageAfterAnimation exposed for the user now ? @ZanderBrown @nolimits4web \r\nAlso, can we have an option for opening standalone autocomplete in popup/page **without** animation ?? @ZanderBrown \r\nI just tested your solution and on Ios, the search input is focused correctly. However, the keyboard does NOT show up. This has something to do with manual input focus on IOS. The only way this would work is by disabling animation. Do you have an idea how this can be achieved ?

When the autocomplete page is triggered to re-open again, it displayed the previously selected value which is nice. However, when the user re-chooses the previously selected item, the page does not close. If he wants to go back, the only option he has is to select the Back arrow key in the top corner of the autocomplete page. This is inconvenient for many users. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior: if a user selects a previously selected item when backOnSelect is set to true, the autocomplete page should still close.  On the Index page I have hidden the Toolbar div and have used the accordian list view in the page content. But there is a blank space that has popped up above the accordian.

It is driving me crazy :( Here are more details:\r\n\r\nI have a normal iOS example that consists of an index page (LEVEL 1), it has some links I use to open other pages  (LEVEL 2).\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar mainView = myApp.addView('.view-main', {\r\n\tdynamicNavbar: true,\r\n\tdomCache: true\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn those Level 2 pages, I have a button that opens a photo browser:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$$('.ad-popup, .ad-images img').on('click', function() {\r\n\t\tvar photos = [];\r\n\t\t$$(\".ad-images .swiper-slide img\").each(function() {\r\n\t\t\tphotos.push($$(this).data('full'));\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\tvar photoBrowser = myApp.photoBrowser({\r\n\t\t\tphotos: photos,\r\n\t\t\tlazyLoading: true,\r\n\t\t\tloop: true,\r\n\t\t\ttype: 'page',\r\n\t\t\tbackLinkText: _t('Close'),\r\n                        ofText: _t('of'),\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t\tphotoBrowser.open();\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter clicking, a LEVEL 3 page will show up with the photo slider, for now everything is normal.\r\nIf I click back to page LEVEL 2, everything is normal also, but when I get back to the Index page, the navbar get disappear! when I try to inspect the navbar element, I see the strange thing is that navbar-inner has a new class called `navbar-inner navbar-on-left cached` and the `center` class has another `sliding` class which is stuck there with a style element `style=\"left: 0px; transform: translate3d(-122.5px, 0px, 0px);\"` ... looks like the JavaScript sliding method get stuck and never continues the animation!\r\n\r\nHere is a GIF video describing the issue again!

Probably it could be changed to padding, need to check won't it be a breaking change I just checked and Media Lists will not be affected by this change since the margin-left property is kept due to rule of `.list-block .item-media + .item-inner`.

You can start from forking one of the templates: Material [Material Kitchensink](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/), iOS [iOS Kitchensink](http://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-ios/)\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nOpen the page. No coding modifications added.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe page should render properly like in WebKit-based browser (Safari, Google Chrome, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nBubble/Notification Tag (such as 'NEW' text on list) does not aligned properly, The bottom part of page is hidden by footer. This can be shown under the 'Messages' example.\r\n\r\n### Further reason to file this bug\r\nSome people are still using Mozilla Firefox, whether they are developing an app using Framework7 or visiting a mobile site powered by Framework7. As this issue happens in Android, I think that the issue also exist in desktop versions of Firefox. In case a regression in Firefox is confirmed, it may take months for the fix to be released, as it passes through many testing channels. F7 is a HTML Framework targeted for iOS and Android, as advertised on the homepage \"Full Featured HTML Framework For Building iOS & Android Apps\"\r\niOS and Android don't use Firefox as internal browser, so I dont think bugs in FF are a concern. I use FF daily in Android as my primary browser. \r\n\r\nIf F7 is targeting only hibrid apps really it should not care about FF, but if is targeting web apps os reasonably to support it. Since FF is mostly web standard compliant should have no big issues. > I use FF daily in Android as my primary browser.\r\n\r\nYour primary and the internal browser are not the same, so F7 will work fine no matter what browser you use for surfing  This is a :\r\n* [x] bug\r\n\r\n* Framework7 Version: 1.5.0\r\n* Platform and Target: Cordova\r\n\r\n### What you did\r\nCreated a hybrid app using framework7 of version 1.5.0 and cordova  version 4.2+.\r\nThe applications contains of 4 tabs and each tab content has two containers called `.js-grid .js-grid-loose` and `.js-grid .js-grid-condensed`. I implemented a grid view toggle that toggles data list between loose and condensed views.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWhen user clicks on toggle button, I save the view mode in localStorage. After that each tab being clicked, I find the relative tab content, remove `active` class from all `.js-grid` elements and add `active` class to the `.js-grid-${mode}` element inside the tab content container. Consider a case that user clicks toggle to change view mode to *loose* mode. After that he clicks on `recent-news` tab, the content is inside `#tab-recent-news`, It should remove active class from all `.js-grid` elements and add active class to `#tab-recent-news .js-grid-loose`. I'm using DOM7 and no jQuery!\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nIt seems that DOM7 removes active class from all `.js-grid` elements but can't add active class to the active tab on `tab:show` event. but when I wrap the dom manipulation function inside `setTimeout(function(){...}, 0)`, It works as expected!\r\n\r\nI guess the actions are being implemented simultaneously so when DOM7 is busy working with tabs, can't do any dom manipulation in sync.\r\n Would be good to see code example of how you are doing it or live example (or JSFiddle/Codepen) with the issue @nolimits4web  I'll try to create a fiddle for the case and permalink it here.

I would contend that both behaviors are desirable when clicking the already selected date.\r\n\r\nI propose removing the line above and adding a condition around the p.addValue call as such:\r\n`if (!day.hasClass('picker-calendar-day-selected')) {\r\n     p.addValue(new Date(dateYear, dateMonth, dateDay).getTime());\r\n}`\r\n  append() function not work with multiple values in the custom jquery ($$) For example? $(\".skills\").append(skill1, skill2, skill3, skill4, skill5);\r\n\r\nIn this case I had to use regular jquery because with $$ it wasn't working  Hello,\r\n\r\nI have this setup here:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/beli3ver/438c14e92f57881933c612717c6612c6\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the 3 tab, I want that the file about.html ist loading, but nothing happends.\r\nCould you maybe help me? Are you loading it though a server or direct from the file system?

To activate the hash navigation I set: `domCache: true`\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nI expected that the ajax pages wouldn't be loaded any more as soon as they are cached  AND the cached page will be shown. Mixing Ajax and inline pages should be possible.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe cashed page remains in DOM and the ajax page is also loaded. The bad thing about it is that it results in duplication of id's - the code picks the cached page (which is the first in dom) but the fresh loaded page is the one being displayed. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe DOM after first ajax-questions-page loading:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"views\">\r\n    <!-- view -->\r\n    <div class=\"view view-main\" data-page=\"questions\">\r\n        <div class=\"navbar\">...</div>\r\n        <!-- Pages container -->\r\n        <div class=\"pages navbar-fixed toolbar-fixed\">\r\n            <!-- questions is the ajax page questions.html -->\r\n            <div data-page=\"questions\" class=\"page page-on-left\">...</div>\r\n            <!-- this is my inline page -->\r\n            <div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page page-on-left\">...</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <!-- /pages -->\r\n    </div>\r\n    <!-- /view -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe DOM after second ajax-questions-page loading:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"views\">\r\n    <!-- view -->\r\n    <div class=\"view view-main\" data-page=\"questions\">\r\n        <div class=\"navbar\">...</div>\r\n        <!-- Pages container -->\r\n        <div class=\"pages navbar-fixed toolbar-fixed\">\r\n            <!-- questions is the ajax page questions.html -->\r\n            <div data-page=\"questions\" class=\"page page-on-left cached\">...</div>\r\n            <!-- this is my inline page -->\r\n            <div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page page-on-left\">...</div>\r\n            <!-- this shouldn't be happening -->\r\n            <div data-page=\"questions\" class=\"page page-on-center\">...</div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <!-- /pages -->\r\n    </div>\r\n    <!-- /view -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo what's happening is the duplication of the ajax loaded page after the second loading. The cached version isn't being used or being displayed.  Mixing inline- with ajax pages isn't obviously working. But it would be great if it would.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdrian Maleska I have the same problem @valnub that's my interpretation of the docs however given the name it is definitely a little misleading @valnub You conclusion might be right but it's not a solution for the given problem which is: using inline pages together with ajax pages - this is a very common scenario and a problem for everybody with F7.  So you have page `x` stored in the DOM and page `x.html` which contains the same page and is being loaded over ajax? @valnub that was my thinking. Hence my request for clarification @valnub The docs aren't that clear about this topic IMO otherwise I wouldn't even try to mix it. But I agree to change this issue from but to feature request.  \r\n\r\n@ZanderBrown Actually I have page x in DOM and load y.html over ajax. I end then in having x in the DOM, y.html cached and y.html loaded over Ajax - but the y.html cached version isn't even being used/displayed. @Hexodus slightly confused here.

This is a (multiple allowed):\r\n* [x] bug\r\n* [ ] enhancement\r\n* [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\r\n\r\n* Framework7 Version: 1.5.2.\r\n* Platform and Target: Android AND ios\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue is that in the autocomplete dropdown menu, when a user starts typing a character at time, Framework7 automatically *highlights* the matched character in the dropdown autocomplete menu by adding the bold HTML attribute (i.e. <b>Ap</b>) to the matched character in all the words of the dropdown menu.  This is problematic as words in languages where letters are connected seem to be broken since the shape of the character changes when it is part of a word. \r\n\r\nTo solve the above, it would be nice to add an option to Autocomplete for disabling the above behavior.  The above explained behavior occurs on both IOS and Android. It would be very much appreciated if a fast solution can be proposed to resolve the issue.  ![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17817239/21456384/61742302-c930-11e6-9930-cc372803bbc3.gif)\r\n\r\nThe messages layout collapse after adding new message, im just using the standard example, i even tried `myMessages.layout()` after adding the message but it didn't work.\r\n\r\nIt was working fine before upgrading to 1.5.2.\r\n\r\nAnything i should fix?

I would appreciate if there are given font-sizes for the most used icon positions, so that the `<i>` elements are sized properly by default :-) Depending on the icon font and the position (list media, buttons, text inline) there is a font range so that icons looks great. That could be defined as default, so that everything looks fine, even if the developer didn't define the font size additionally.  If we use the Material Tabbar and set it to scrollable, but the Tabbar itself is empty, an error will occur because the active tab bar does not exist.

Merged, thanks! Sorry for the delay Great news @nolimits4web @marcsoler  This is a (multiple allowed):\n- [ ] bug\n- [ ] enhancement\n- [x] feature-discussion (RFC)\n\nOther than a few small examples here and there on GitHub, there doesn't appear to be a React version of Framework7. My team and I have a good start on a React version of Framework7 that we're considering open sourcing at some point. Before we go through the work to do that, I'd like to make sure that we're not duplicating effort that anyone else is doing.\n\nOur goal is to have a React framework that relies only on Framework7 HTML and LESS, and not its JavaScript--something similar to www.material-ui.com, except that supports both iOS and Material.\n\nDoes anyone have knowledge of a React version of Framework7 in development, or perhaps of any similar efforts?\n On [patreon.com](https://www.patreon.com/vladimirkharlampidi) it says that React support is planned but I wouldn't bet my money on it to be released anytime soon.\n\nPledging a few bucks on that site might speed up the process tho ;-)\n\nUntil then, why don't you share your experiences and your code on a Github repo? Could be interesting.\n Thanks, I never saw that roadmap posted on patreon. I'm not sure how far along that effort is, but perhaps what I have so far can be a contribution. I'll be posting my code in a few weeks once I get a chance to clean and package it up and write docs.\n Vote for prioritized support of vue.js. Any specific plans/ideas for that? Have you seen https://github.com/lmk123/vue-framework7 ? (it is in Chinese, though)\n Great to hear from you @nolimits4web. That works for me--I'll see if I can get an initial pull request ready in the coming weeks. To be clear, the React components I have at this time are far from the complete Framework7, but cover many of the essentials: views, pages & navbars with the animated transitions, tabbars, toolbars, side-panels, buttons, lists, etc.) and should be a good start. They were developed as requirements of another project, which is in its initial stages and will be an ongoing effort, and should continue to drive ongoing contributions for a while.\n\nNo Material support just yet, but I'd really like to have it soon. The LESS does such a good job of handling the differences that it shouldn't be too far off. In cases where the markup does differ (like with page and navbar nesting), I would imagine that the components should handle the rendering differences automatically. I've mused about perhaps having an overall F7 App component where Material vs. iOS, color themes, RTL, etc. are specified and propagated to child components via React context (similar to [Material-UI's](www.material-ui.com) MuiThemeProvider), but I digress, and all of that can be a discussion for a different day.\n ReactJS is really the way to go. Looking forward.\n@nolimits4web could there be a split of the core project into the html+css and js parts?\n I would really be happy to see some TypeScript work as well.\n @ZanderBrown, interesting that you should mention that, because the React components I have are actually all written in TypeScript. Not everyone is a fan of TypeScript, so that may or may not be a point of contention.\n\nIndeed, @inoas, it would seem that a fundamental restructuring of some sort would be in order. I'd be interested if @nolimits4web had anything in mind at this point. It would seem that the LESS would shared, and perhaps some JavaScript would be shared as well. The examples, kitchen sink, and docs would seemingly need to be separate efforts. The argument could certainly be made to keep all of the docs in one place, perhaps with a tabbed interface like [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string%28v=vs.110%29.aspx).\n I can't speak for anybody but my guess is, that for collaboration to work it would be easiest to have a repo for the HTML/CSS/LESS (or SCSS) stuff including assets such as icons and one repo that features the standard javascript, then maybe another that works with vue ... and then anyone could create something, say based on ReactJS or even ELM.\n I also vote for React support and (optional) Typescript.\n\nHaven't really heard much about vue.js to be honest..\n I think it would be easier to maintain if we used TypeScript and much like the use of less it doesn't mean people have to use it in their projects.\n\nI have actually been working on porting dom7 with mixed results.\n I'd love to see Framework7-React and/or Framework7-Elm.\nWith those there would be a chance to pass beyond Ionic.\n Great to see some progress in Vue! I'll take a look and see what cues I can pick up. ;)\n\nframework7-react is also in progress: https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-react/tree/initial-code/. It leverages the framework7 NPM module for the LESS. I'm considering webpack for automatically creating a minimal CSS file for only the components being used, but am not sure whether or not to make the library be opinionated toward webpack (as opposed to browserify).\n\nCurrently working on getting a kitchen sink up and going. Will be creating issues and milestones soon to provide better visibility into progress.\n\nAddressing earlier comments about TypeScript, it does use TypeScript, but compiles to ES5. The TypeScript compiler also generates .d.ts files, which will be in the NPM package along with the .js files (and LESS) and provide typings for TypeScript consumers. So, the NPM module will be consumable from TypeScript, ES5, ES6, CoffeeScript, etc.\n ... and would make it MUCH easier to develop F7\n Probably it should change on top of the agenda about the ajax pages? Cuz it not greatly work with react-router\n Will the Vue fork of F7 enable us eventually to use Weex for generating native UI components with the aid of Vue 2.0 ? http://alibaba.github.io/weex/index.html\n Sounds very exciting. Thanks a lot, Vladimir, for your great efforts and amazing library. Would you recommend to start using vue.js components for F7 or wait a bit for more maturity?\n\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e! \n I got my initial branch in a stable state and merged it to master. Here's the kitchen sink: https://bencompton.github.io/framework7-react/kitchen-sink-ios/\n\nThere's not much in the kitchen sink for now, but there will be more coming soon. It doesn't yet show off all of the components currently in framework7-react, but it does demonstrate basic usage. More or less just a teaser at this point.\n\nI'll post here again once I have more worth showing. Next on the agenda is Material support. Like the Vue version, I've been trying to make an API that abstracts away various DOM differences to make things simpler for the consumer. For example, a page and its navbar will automatically render appropriately for iOS and Material (navbar outside of the page and inside of the page respectively).\n\nI do have more work to do to better align the API with framework7-vue. I'm pretty new to Vue, so I have some learning to do. One thing I'm not sure about is how much custom router code is appropriate for a React UI framework. I don't know about Vue, but the React community has pretty well settled on react-router (and react-router-redux), and you can see that is what I am using in the kitchen sink. I think this topic is certainly worth discussing further.\n\nThe kitchen sink also is not using a state management library (like Redux) for the sake of simplicity, but there will definitely need to be one or more examples with Redux. A fundamental design decision of this library is that all components are stateless and rely heavily on props. For example, you'll notice that the SidePanel component has an isOpen prop and relies on the consumer to provide the state management for whether or not the SidePanel should be open or not. Another example is the pages and navbars: the state for which direction they should be animating based on the last navigation action the user took, which the consumer is responsible for tracking and specifying (usually in the top-level Framework7App component). Given that Redux is a de-facto standard in the React community, I think stateless components are the best way to go, but this might be another topic worth discussing further.\n\nAnyhow, the code is available for perusing in this repo and if anyone has any questions or feedback, feel free add an issue here: https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-react.\n **And what about Angular2-Support?** \n\nI like vue.js also, however, vue.js is not the only _little_ framework out here and according to http://stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark4/webdriver-ts/table.html you can see, if you really need the fastest then you can go with inferno.js, monkberry.js or ractivejs. \n\n**I guess, Angular2/React is a lot more popular and if F7 chooses a framework then it should first provide Angular2/React-support.** \n\nI guess, there are no issues using f7 with angular2. However, f7 has no .d.ts-file (http://definitelytyped.org/). So supporting typescript needs to be the first way to support angular2. Another thing is, f7 has template7 so maybe its template engine can be extended to provide vue-like things as it is already available in f7.\n Can't remember where but I did find `.d.ts` somewhere however the design of Dom7 makes it tricky\n If a \"f7.d.ts\" exists, then it should be available in http://definitelytyped.org/.\n @nimo23 there is not so much to gain from supporting Angular2 as there is Angular1+Ionic and Angular2+Ionic2. However there is nothing that works \"mostly\" out of the box for ReactJS. And ReactJS is getting traction https://www.quora.com/Is-React-killing-Angular and https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.84pwa0s51\n\nAlso the JSX Model of ReactJS works pretty well with Framework7 (stripped off its javascript) already.\n > as there is Angular1+Ionic and Angular2+Ionic2\n\nYes, you are right. I tried ionic 1 and found f7 a lot better and faster. I do not know if this is true with ionic 2. I will try.\n\n**But the question is:**\nWould f7 benefit from being converted to a typescript project? Bugs/Code Quality/Performance/Extendability/etc. I guess, yes. Iconic2 is written in typescript and there is a lot of gain for f7 also.\n Can't say. Sure it would benefit from being rewritten into ELM, too ;-)\nHowever I think it would benefit the most if there was a clear split between the HTML/CSS/SVG etc parts and the javascript libraries, so that those can be replaced easily.\n In my opinion, before starting to make f7 more consumable by using vue.js, it should be ported to typescript. From typescript, developers can build view-templates/components as they like (angular2, react, vue.js, etc) more easily.\n > However I think it would benefit the most if there was a clear split between the HTML/CSS/SVG etc parts and the javascript libraries, so that those can be replaced easily.\n\nI think the source code basis of f7 is already well splitted into \"components\". But the problem is, they are concatenated and only then it works. For sure, you can use the f7 build tool to have a smaller file with selected \"components\". However, would be better to use module loader and do something like this:\n\n`import {accordion} from accordion;`\n\nwith code completion/css imports/tree shaking and the like.\n\nThere are a lot of benefits to use typescript for f7-project. The only thing where I am not sure is: performance. Would it be faster or slower? Does typescript produces faster, more optimized code as it is already the case? I dont know. Actually, F7 has really good performance. \n In theory the performance should be the same or better.\nF7 in its current form is written much in the way TS out output it.\n\nPorting F7 itself should be easy but in my experience Dom7 is much more problematic (`$$` is both a `Object` and a `Class`)\n > > but in my experience Dom7 is much more problematic\n\nThat's interesting. So the first step would be to abstract all Dom-Manipulation (of $$) within F7-Typescript?\n it think once a API compatible Dom7 could be developed in TypeScript the rest of F7 should follow quite easy\n React vs Ember vs Vue vs Angular https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/802259998504026112 This is also related: https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2016-results#q12-knowledge-of-javascript-libraries-and-frameworks\r\n\r\nReactJS surpassed Angular 1 and Angular 2 is not picking up. Vue is rather small. I think porting to TypeScript would make it easier to create bindings for theses after all Angular 2 is written in TypeScript itself @bencompton Are you still working on the React version? I vue.js even being pursued?? If so, i'd be happy to contribute, by the way, the kitchen sink link doesn't exist anymore @farskid, the React version is still in development. Check out the [Framework7 React repo home page](https://github.com/bencompton/Framework7-react) for the latest news. [Framework7 Vue](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7-Vue) is also in development. The Vue version is already published on NPM, but not yet at 1.0. We're hoping to have the React version caught up to the Vue version soon. i'm still on and off attempting a TypeScript port with thus far little success @ZanderBrown, do you mean that you're rewriting Framework7 in TypeScript? Personally, I would be happy even if Framework7 just had TypeScript typings like a lot of other JavaScript libraries do. The Jade files in the Framework7 docs should actually have all of the data necessary (argument names + types, events, etc.) to be able to generate TypeScript typings automatically. If there were a gulp task parsing the Jade and spitting out typings, I would think that would be the easiest way to add TypeScript support to Framework7 and also keep the typings in sync with the framework in the future.\r\n\r\nFramework7 React is now generating all of the React components automatically from the Framework7 Vue components. The Vue components all have props definitions so Vue can automatically validate props when consumed from JavaScript, but I am generating TypeScript interfaces from those automatically for the React components (the generated React components are all TypeScript). It would be great if Framework7 Vue had a gulp task that automatically generated typings for Framework7 Vue from these props.\r\n\r\nI have thought about contributing auto-generated typings for both when I get time (which likely won't be for a while). If anyone wants to give it a shot, feel free. @valnub - wow, I wasn't aware of those. Thanks for sharing!

PLEASE READ MY COMMENT BELOW. This bug does NOT cause an exception. It however causes the some links to stop functions such as the back link for the auto generated smartlink and the link for searchbar.\n\n---\n\nFramework7 expects ALL anchor links as in (< a >) links to have a \"href\" attribute. If there is a link with a missing \"href\" attribute and is used for example to open a popup with the class='open-popup' and the data- attributes, the framework would give an exception.\n\nOne may ask why a link would not have an href attribute ? Because the WKWebview for IOS sometimes crashes/freezes the app when there are empty links with empty href attribute (as in <a href=\"#\" ></a>).\n## And in any case, it should be extremely an easy fix in Framework7 to simply check if there is an href attribute before processing the content of the attribute.\n I've made few changes to the original source code to fix the problems I was facing. This was done probably five or six months ago. I'll try to find the changes and get back. From what I recall, the problem was with the back/close button in the navbar of smartselects and searchbars.  It was an easy and quick fix but I spent several days till I figured out the source of the problem with href='#' attributes as was outlined in the Ionic blog and Framework7 forums by several members.\n Ok, I think I found it. \nOn last 5430 of the dist version of Framework7, I had to change the leftTemplate source code for the auto generated smartselect to the following:\n\n`leftTemplate: openIn === 'popup' ? \n                        (app.params.smartSelectPopupCloseTemplate || (material ? '<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"emptyLink\" class=\"link close-popup icon-only\"><i class=\"icon icon-back\"></i></a></div>' : '<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"emptyLink\" class=\"link close-popup\"><i class=\"icon icon-back\"></i><span>{{closeText}}</span></a></div>')).replace(/{{closeText}}/g, closeText) :\n                        (app.params.smartSelectBackTemplate || (material ? '<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"emptyLink\" class=\"back link icon-only\"><i class=\"icon icon-back\"></i></a></div>' : '<div class=\"left sliding\"><a href=\"emptyLink\" class=\"back link\"><i class=\"icon icon-back\"></i><span>{{backText}}</span></a></div>')).replace(/{{backText}}/g, backText)\n`\n\nI think when href is removed, the links no longer work as expected with smartselect.  \n\nThen,  on 5462 I also modified the searchbarHTML variable in order to update the href attribute to something like href='emptyLink'. \n\nI'm updating this issue since it is NOT exactly an exception/crash as I described earlier. However, the function of the \"searchbar-cancel\" and \"close-popup\" links would NOT work if the href attribute is missing.\n **AN UPDATE TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE...**\n\nI think this is still a bug. As I mentioned before, for the close link that is auto generated for the smartselect, if there is a missing href attribute, the link would not work (even though it has the \"back\" class).  The issue also happens with the searchbarHTML (on linke 5462 of the Framework7 dist file) as removing the href attribute would not make the link work.\n Can you post a fiddle or codepen example so the issue can be replicated?

Or you post your code into a Github repo.\n i will upload it now but it might take a while since it is 4.5 Gigabytes\n I think I might be able to shed some light on this issue. @valnub @nolimits4web @JosephShenton \n\nif you enable template7 and are using precompiled templates when you go to a page that includes a template and hit back; template7 for some reason reloads the page that is sent to the right. This reload then errors out and crashes framework7 because the context is not successfully found resulting in a \"ctx_1.example is undefined\" TypeError.\n\nThe quick fix to this is to use {{#if this.example}} {{/if}} in your templating to check if the context exists before errors occur. This isn't an elegant solution and #1134 should be re-addressed since this should be handled programmatically.\n\nThe secondary issue us figuring out why template7 is reloading a page that is not in use in the first place.\n\nHope this helps!\n  I have four pages, index.html, test01.html, test02.html, test03.html.\nEach page has the code like this\n\n```\n<div class=\"navbar\">\n    <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n        <!-- We need cool sliding animation on title element, so we have additional \"sliding\" class -->\n        <div class=\"left sliding\">\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"link back\">\n                <i class=\"material-icons\">navigate_before</i>\n            </a>\n            <a href=\"test01.html\" data-ignore-cache=\"true\">test01</a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nbut when I reached test03.html, and then click the back button, it can back to the test02.html,\nand then click the back button in test02.html, it can not back to the test01.html\nI don't know how can I implement it, please help\n\nps: sorry for my English, wish you can understand what I mean :-)\n Does it go anywhere?\n @ZanderBrown NO, nothing happened :( \n try using the demo\nsomething must be wrong\n Are there any errors in js console?\n\nIf you can post a fiddle or codepen example it would be easier to help you and debug this:\n- http://www.jsfiddle.net\n- http://www.codepen.io\n @AlwaysBee can you put your project in a repository ? \nAre you running this on http server like apache? \n\nYou need to understand the navagation history is the base to use the back link. So if you came from another page, this page will be the back page, so in this case i suggest you organize your project and review your HTML and links to be sure, if all are in the right place. \n  This is a (multiple allowed):\n- [ ] bug\n- [ ] enhancement\n- [x] feature-discussion (RFC)\n- Framework7 Version: Latest Version.\n- Platform and Target: PC Android, ETC.\n\nHello, sorry if this has been already discussed, but I want to know if its possible to call a modal like the one from the example: https://framework7.io/kitchen-sink-material/ (popup link) with custom html file.\nI want to show the content of a custom html file like in the views.

To reproduce, in template7-pages example, just add following line to car.html and click on a car then try to click on the back link.\n\n```\n        <li><b>Air</b> - {{features.air}}</li>\n```\n### Expected Behavior\n\nExpect that if data is missing from context it would just render with blank data.\n### Actual Behavior\n\nUsing Template7 pages, if context data is not valid for template, rendering the template fails and leaves view.allowPageChange set to false. Subsequent calls to load pages then all fail.\n Hmmm, I understand the error is hard to prevent, but the bug is about what happens if it does occur.  Right now you can't render any pages in the entire app since the allowPageChange flag never gets reset.  \n\nHow about adding a try/catch around the call?  Then that page wouldn't render, but the app wouldn't stop working. I'm not familiar with the codebase, but something like:\n\n```\ntry {\n    t7_rendered_content = t7_template( t7_ctx );\n}\ncatch( e ) {\n    console.log( e.message );\n    t7_rendered_content = '';\n}\n```\n  **BUG**\n\n**Version: 1.4.2**\n\nI have a \"accordion item\" **within** a \"picker modal\" and have this event:\n\n```\n$$('.picker-modal').on('open', '.picker-modal', function (e) {\n            e.stopPropagation();\n            console.log('picker opened');\n        }, false);\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this live-event will also be triggered if one item with css-class \".accordion-item\" is expanded even if the picker-modal is already opened. The same goes for \n\n`$$('.picker-modal').on('close',`\n\nIf I shrink the \".accordion-item\" (after it was expanded), then the close-Event of \".picker-modal\" will be fired, even if the \".picker-modal\" is not really closed. I guess, \".picker-modal\"-open/closed events are not really isolated from \".accordion-item\"-events. \n\nAccording to docs, picker-modal and accordion-items uses the **same event-names** (.open, .close, .opened, .closed). \n\n**However, these events have to be fired isolated from the both components by f7. Bug?**\n Can you create a fiddle to reproduce the problem? Thanks :) http://www.jsfiddle.net\n  This is a (multiple allowed):\n- [] bug\n- [ ] enhancement\n- [x] feature-discussion (RFC)\n\nActually, the Side-Panels have \"panel-left\" and \"panel-right\". Please extend the side-panel:\n- enable \"panel-top\" (side-panel comes from top to bottom (for example, half of the screen)\n- enable \"panel-bottom\" (side-panel comes from bottom to top (for example, half of the screen)\n\nThis would be great! Thanks!\n I don't think there is such a feature in original iOS or Material Design, or not?\n I know, it s not material. But why limiting the developers creativity by saying: \"No, you are not allowed to make a panel-top or panel-bottom\". It would be easy to add these two animations as the panels are already in f7. \n\nF7 has already some cool features which are not really ios or material specific such as \"picker-modal\", so it is definitly not wrong to add such cool features to f7. Because this is what f7 aparts from others. A mixture from the best of both is not wrong.\n I think @nolimits4web has to decide if this gets implemented or not\n I'm failing to see any uses for these\n F7 has already a \"picker modal\" which slides like a picker from bottom to top. The content can be anything. And it is useful. However, a sidepanel could be used as a kind like that and as a kind of \"split-screen\". The other content is darken when sidepanel is active and I can close the sidepanel when clicking the page (darken area) - this is already the case for f7-sidepanel. The \"split-screen\" (=sidepanel from bottom or top) can be opened for anything where I dont want to make the user a need for a page-transistion. Like a \"speed-dialog\" for the page. It is useful and the sidepanel is already in f7 - I guess, only two transition modes are needed (from top to bottom and vice versa).\n you mean like a popup? why not use that?\n popup behaves differently and is fullscreen..\n @nimo23 Why don't you create a plug-in that replicates this feature for ppl who want it?\nIf it's good, F7 would even mention it on the plugins section: http://framework7.io/plugins/\n I also would like to have similar functionality. Some kind of bottom panel, that we can expand by click or swipe. Just like bottom panel in Uber for example.\n I already have both top and bottom panels should i make a plugin for them?\n and they are also activated via swipe up and swipe down\n For my opinion, writing a \"plugin\" for a thing which is already included in f7 is not reasonable. F7 has already a \"side-panel\" which can be positioned left or right (sidepanel_right, sidepanel_left). F7 needs \"sidepanel_top\" and \"sidepanel_bottom\". Nothing else. It s only transition operation.\n @iHackify, that sounds good!! push request or plugin? I dont know? Maybe it will be included in the next f7-version. File size and performance matters..\n Well idk really how to use GitHub so if u could help me with a push request that would be great @nimo23 \n Just to clarify you are going to attempt a **Pull** Request?\n @ZanderBrown Yes\n ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12966231/18766697/d4a02db8-815e-11e6-9b82-81ea9286d263.png)\nIs that what you guys mean by bottom panel?\n A kind of this. Look at **f7-sidepanel**. Exactly the same behaviour and visual experience, the only difference is: it splits the screen not from left or right side but from bottom or top. That s all. And if I click anything outside from the sidepanel, the sidepanel closes. This is actually not the case for f7-\"popup\" or f7-\"picker-modal\", but for f7-\"sidepanel\".\n Are you guys aware that such a panel would collidate with control center in iOS when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen?\n I vote this issue be closed\n > And actually if you need something swipe from up or down you can easily use popup\n\nCould you please provide an example how to open popup with swipe gesture?\n @waptaxi \n\nCSS \n\n```\n\n.popup{\n    position: absolute;\n    left: 0;\n    top: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n    z-index: 11000;\n    background: transparent;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    display: none;\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    -webkit-transition-property: -webkit-transform;\n    -moz-transition-property: -moz-transform;\n    -ms-transition-property: -ms-transform;\n    -o-transition-property: -o-transform;\n    transition-property: transform;\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,100%,0);\n    transform: translate3d(0,100%,0);\n}\n\n.halfpanel-bottom {\n  height: 70%;\n  width: 100%;\n  position: absolute;\n  background: #FFF;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n}\n```\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://libraries.cdnhttps.com/ajax/libs/jquery.touchswipe/1.6.12/jquery.touchSwipe.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"my-app.js\"></script>\n<div class=\"popup popup-halfpanel-bottom\">\n      <div class=\"halfpanel-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n        <p>halfpanel-bottom</p>\n        <p><a href=\"#\" class=\"close-popup\">Close</a></p>\n        <p>Content</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n```\n\nJS\nInside of my-app.js\n\n```\n$(function() {      \n      // Enable swiping...\n      $(\"body\").swipe( {\n        // Single swipe handler for left swipes\n        swipeUp:function(event, direction, distance, duration, fingerCount) {\n          myApp.popup('.popup-halfpanel-bottom');\n        },\n        // Default is 75px, set to 0 for demo so any distance triggers swipe\n        threshold:75\n      });\n    });\n\n    $(function() {      \n      // Enable swiping...\n      $(\"body\").swipe( {\n        // Single swipe handler for left swipes\n        swipeDown:function(event, direction, distance, duration, fingerCount) {\n          myApp.closeModal('.popup-halfpanel-bottom');\n        },\n        // Default is 75px, set to 0 for demo so any distance triggers swipe\n        threshold:75\n      });\n    });\n\n```\n\nThat's what you need for the swipe and bottom panel... Oh and @nolimits4web and @valnub this doesn't conflict with the control center from what my testing has shown\n @iHackify \nSo you use third-party library for swipes.\nAnd I think your popup just opens on swipe up, but not follows the finger as F7 side menu does.\nAnd swipes in application don't conflict with iOS control center as system swipes must be done from the side of the screen. Side menu we can enable with some threshold from the side.\nThere's similar functionality in Uber application, but there we can see small panel at the bottom, which we can expand by swiping up.\n yeah i can try to make it using the inbuilt follow finger if u like\n @iHackify if you going to do it you should probably do it properly. Personally, I would rather you didn't do it at all\n Actually, I guess, you are right about that: \"it will conflict with native control center\".\n\n**But I wanted to make this:** \nTrigger the \"bottom panel\" by \"swipe up the bottom toolbar\" and the \"top panel\" by \"swipe down the fixed subnavbar\". It s a kind of split-screen or \"2 pages\" within \"one page\". Look for example, Android 7 which now supports \"Dual-Screen\". So it is really a feature which can better usability (not having to switch totally from one page to another and back again).\n\nI will solve that with a popup and resizing as suggested. However, I have to put a listener which closes the popup when clicking about the popup. Sidepanel have such feature with \"panelsCloseByOutside\" and other things. So you see, f7-sidepanel has all the features which would make a good candidate for \"bottom and top panel\".\n\nHowever, if nobody is interested in that, we can close this issue.\n  In the App Layout sample html for Material in the documentation here:\nhttps://framework7.io/docs/app-layout.html\n\nI think the bottom toolbar needs `toolbar-bottom` class added?\n\n`<div class=\"toolbar\">`\n\nI think it needs to change to:\n\n`<div class=\"toolbar toolbar-bottom\">`\n Yes, I think you're right and should be fixed in docs @nolimits4web \n  This is a:\n- [x] bug\n- Framework7 Version: 1.42.\n- Platform and Target: iOS Cordova + macOS Safari.\n### What you did\n\nTrying to test out a search function, thought I'd use a virtual list + searchbar. \n\nI've only used the basic example code and not (yet) customised any parameters to generate the virtual list:\n\n```\nvar myList = myApp.virtualList('.list-block', {\n    items: [1,2,3,4],\n    height: 44\n}); \n\n```\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nThe virtual list is populated\n### Actual Behaviour\n\nIf script is called before navigation has finished, navigation is aborted. If called after navigation is finished the list is populated with blank items. Either way console gives an error:\n\n> TypeError: o[w].trim is not a function. (In 'o[w].trim()', 'o[w].trim' is undefined)\n I can replicate this. Safari and Chrome.\n Can you create a quick fiddle? Then it's easier to dig into the issue: http://www.jsfiddle.net\n Closed due to no response\n I get this as well. \r\n\r\nI use the example from framwork7, to what I can see, exact meassures.\r\n\r\nJS\r\n`\tvar myList = myApp.virtualList('.list-block.virtual-list', {\r\n\t    items: [1,2,3,4],\r\n\t    height: 44\r\n\t}); \r\n`\r\nHTML\r\n`\t    <div class=\"list-block virtual-list\">\r\n\t      <!-- keep it empty -->\r\n\t    </div>\r\n`\r\n\r\nThe error message from console is:\r\nframework7.js:5946 Uncaught TypeError: o[w].trim is not a function\r\n    at g.r.render (framework7.js:5946)\r\n    at g.r.init (framework7.js:6040)\r\n    at new g (framework7.js:6205)\r\n    at window.Framework7.i.virtualList (framework7.js:6214)\r\n    at r.<anonymous> (get_new_position.js:33)\r\n    at r.n.emit (socket.io.min.js:1)\r\n    at r.onevent (socket.io.min.js:1)\r\n    at r.onpacket (socket.io.min.js:1)\r\n    at n.<anonymous> (socket.io.min.js:1)\r\n    at n.emit (socket.io.min.js:1)\r\n\r\nAny hints is appreciated.  @peterel  can you create  a jsfiddle that shows it happening @tobya Thanks. My suspicion of this being related to socket.io was wrong. I could replicate the issue in a jsfiddle using the sample from the framework7 docs. See https://jsfiddle.net/21rfpzze/ and open the console, you'll see an error \"TypeError: items[i].trim is not a function\" which is very similar to what I wrote that I got in my earlier post.  @tobya Any ideas where this may come from? A working (broken \ud83d\ude04) fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/21rfpzze/1/ @ZanderBrown It is working (broken) :) If you open a console youll see \"TypeError: items[i].trim is not a function\" in both Chrome and FF (on Mac at least). @ZanderBrown, Sorry, I saved against your fiddle!\r\n\r\nHowever, revision #4 shows a working example:\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/21rfpzze/4/\r\n\r\nThe issue you found is that the Virtual List expects an object that can be parsed as an html object (that would have a style property if invoked, like a string containing a div \"<div>blah</div>\"), not base objects (like plain strings \"hello\" or integers 123).\r\n\r\nThe modified fiddle shows a quick'n'dirty use of a template. Thanks :)  This is a (multiple allowed):\n- bug\n- Framework7 Version: 1.4.2\n- Platform and Target: All platforms\n### What you did\n\nTried to unbind an event attached to an element.\n\n```\n$$(this.form).off('submit').on('submit', function (e) {\n    //...\n});\n```\n### Expected Behavior\n\nShould unbind event and re-attach it.\n### Actual Behavior\n\nDoes not unbind event, as a result the event is bound multiple times (this code is called each time a particular page is inited).\n you using an anonymous function so this isn't an F7 bug it's a feature of javascript itself. Also you have to tell DOM7 what to unbind\n\n**_Workaround**_\nReplace your code:\n\n```\n$$(this.form).off('submit').on('submit', function (e) {\n    //...\n});\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```\nformSubmit = function (e) {\n    //...\n};\n$$(this.form).off('submit', formSubmit);\n$$(this.form).on('submit', formSubmit);\n```\n\nFound this out the hard way when the same handler was applied 40 times to the same element!\n\n**_Edit**_\nSee https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener\n After further code investigation, this issue was not caused by framework 7 but by another script. It works !\n $$('.col-imageDiv-a').off('click',aa); $$('.col-imageDiv-a').on('click',aa);\nthis code can't work,how can I solve this error?thanks\n define\n\n> this code can't work\n\nWhat's happening? Is the handler being added twice? not at all?\nWhat is 'aa'?\n @ZanderBrown thanks for reply me.\n\n'aa' is a function\u3002\n\nfunction will be add twice when load data finished,so I want to solve this error.\n\nso,I unbind function before bind 'aa',but '$$('.col-imageDiv-a').off('click',aa); ' doesn't work\n @ZanderBrown   I solve this error,'$$(document).on('click','.col-imageDiv-a', aa);' can solve multiply bind.\n Having this same problem, the following code is inside page:init,\r\n\r\nclickElem = function (e) {\r\n      console.log('elem clicked');\r\n      var classes = $$(this).attr('class').split(' ');\r\n      var id = classes[1];\r\n      console.log(id);\r\n }\r\n $$('body').off('click', '.elem', clickElem);\r\n $$('body').on('click', '.elem', clickElem);\r\n\r\nEverytime I init the page it increments a click call. Well it is not completed yet, the objective of this specific handler is to \"handle\" the click on a list item and load a new page (roomTypeDetails), which will display and allow to modify the info of that element with id=X. \r\n**Don't know if this helps, but the record list is also generated on page:init using template7. The generated html is added to the template BEFORE defining the event handlers.**\r\n\r\nI tried that workaround already, the problem is that everytime the page:init is called (every time that page is loaded) it will add a new .on('click') handler to that class/id. The \"solution\" that works is to put the .on('click') outside page:init itselft, but since that delegate its specific for that page it doens't really make sense to me  defining it \"globally\". I just don't understand why the .off('click') it's not working as exemplified on [https://api.jquery.com/off/]( https://api.jquery.com/off/)\r\n\r\nCumpz. That worked like a charm :D. \r\n\r\nJust for future reference, do you understand why does it work that way, but not when defining the function inside page:init?\r\n\r\nCumpz. Is it a particular case of using page:init? I tried on the browser console to define function a () { console.log('test'); } twice, and after calling a(), only one \"test\" was displayed.\r\n  Please add a small layout module by using flex-layout. For example, \"l-flex-hor\", \"l-flex-vert\". Actually, the \"F7-layout-module\" (\"layout-grid\") uses \"calc-prop\". \n\nWould be nice to add something like \"layout-flex\"-module in F7. \n\nF7 uses already a much of flex-props spread all over the F7-stylesheet. These props can be isolated within a new module \"layout-flex\" which can also be used internally by F7 for layouting and externally be the user.\n You're welcome to create a PR or plugin :-)\n\nSee\n- https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/\n- https://framework7.io/docs/plugins-api.html\n Closed due to no response after 8 days\n  This is a (multiple allowed):\n- [x] bug\n- [ ] enhancement\n- [ ] feature-discussion (RFC)\n- Framework7 1.4.2.\n- Platform and Target: \"framework7.material.css\" and \"framework7.material.colors.css\".\n### What you did\n\nI am using material-design.\n### Expected Behavior\n\nclass=\"layout-white\" should work in material, the same as with ios-them.\n### Actual Behavior\n\nUsing the material desing and applying <body class=\"layout-white\"> does not work.

I just have a basic popover that displays a list of items. If I click an item it closes the modal (because I have the close-popover class on each item). However, as soon as I click the link to show the popover again any item previously tapped still has it's active-state class applied. It works fine in Chrome, just not on iPad in mobile Safari.\n Can someone confirm this? I have no iPad :D\n This is not an issue. Sorry for the delayed response. It turned out this just had to do with the way we were rendering modals and popovers in React. Once we started using react-portal to render our popovers we no longer experienced any issues.

It is working fine if `domCache` is disabled. But I need to enable `domCache`. The issue is after enabling, `domCache:true` the Virtual List is not working fine. It is rendering the list when the page is opened for first time. But when I am navigating again to the list page the Virutal List is not rendering any list items. Below is my code \n\n```\nvar newsList = Djjs.fw7.app.virtualList('.snews-list.virtual-list', {\n    // Array with plain HTML items\n    items: [],\n    renderItem: function (index, item) {\nreturn '<li><a data-id=\"'+index+'\" href=\"post.html\" class=\"item-link item-content\"><div class=\"item-media\"><img class=\"lazy lazy-fadeIn\" data-src=\"https://www.djjs.org/uploads/news/thumbs/'+item.images[0].image+'\" width=\"80\"/></div><div class=\"item-inner\"><div class=\"item-title-row\"><div class=\"item-subtitle\">'+item.title+'</div></div><div class=\"item-text\">'+item.date+'</div></div></a></li>';    \n    },\n    height:90,\n}); \n```\n\nthen from the js file I am calling \n`newsList.appendItems(news);`\n  When you swipe the sidepanel open just al little bit, hold it with your finger and click on a menu item to go to another page then the sidepanel is stuck (\nI can reproduce this issue easily on my iPhone every single time, can this be fixed please?\n  the demo kitchen-sink-iso i set pushState:true in kitchen-sink.js\n\nIndex -> Navbars And Toolbars-> Deep Navbar.\n\non Deep Navbar page click browser refresh, then can't click browser back to Index.\n can anyone tell me why? thanks..\n  This is a small bugfix, sorry I did not open an issue first but the solution seemed trivial and only seems to be an oversight.\n\nWhen using multiple columns virtual list does not properly change it's height.

I am facing issues with the Navigation. When I am navigating deep (2 or more) and again going back to page, the page is refreshing and the compiled templates not displaying. For example \n\n**News page->Detail page->Back to News page (working fine)**\n\nBut---\n\n**News page->Detail Pages->More Detail Page->Back to Detail Page->Back to News Page (Not displaying the template rendering)**\n\nPlease help..\n I got it worked by adding {domCache:true,pushState:true}\n  Hello,\n\nOn android with Cordova or Phonegap, the text is not align on the middle of the button. It is at the top.\n\nThe problem is in the css on the class \"button\" because line-height seem not working on android.\n\nHow can I do ?\n\nI use Framework7 1.4.2\n\nthanks\n Same problem with two devices:\n- Galaxy S7 :  Android 6.0.1\n- Nexus 6: Android N preview 3\n I found the problem.\n\nWith cordova or phongap you need to use the plugin phonegap-mobile-accessibility\n\nOn device ready call add \"MobileAccessibility.usePreferredTextZoom(false);\"\n\nAfter it is ok.\n  I develop an app with phonegap and framework7. Is there a feature to going back using device back button, but still with it awesome animation? When it's browser mode, not phonegap, I can use pushState and the back button (in browser/ device) is work. But when it's phonegap, when I click back button, it doesn't back to history, but it will close the app. I want use both back button (in navbar and device). Is there a feature to use this ? thanks :)\n  As suggested\n  Can you please share the plans and ideas for upcoming features/suggestions as roadmap and estimated release. May be via website.\n @murliatdure what this project needs is contributors for bugs, features, maintenance, community so that @nolimits4web can focus on a roadmap and implementing new major releases.\n  Can we have stacked popup, as most of the times we may need to maintain the context and can represent the details of item via popups rather pages. And there may be requirement of stacking multi-level popups.\n\nHence raising this request. \n\nCurrently I am able to achieve the same, but on close (BACK) of top-most popup closes all popups. Hence I need to override back functionality on open of the latest popup.\n\nCan we simplify the same!\n Can you provide a PR?\n  We\u2019ve faced with an issue.\n\nIf several modals are displayed (for example, `app.alert()`, `app.showPreloader()`), even if \u201cmodal stack\u201d is used, `app.hidePreloader` can close the wrong modal (in our example it closes alert instead of itself).\n\nI assume we need to use a `.modal-preloader` class (instead of an abstract `.modal.modal-in` class) here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/dist/js/framework7.js#L3352\n @ZanderBrown \r\nWell, original issue was created in May 2016. Looks like yes, it's still actual. See here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/dist/js/framework7.js#L3455\r\n\r\nWhen we wrote an app we tried to use `app.hidePreloader()` and it closed the wrong modal for us. I suppose we have changed it to direct call to `app.closeModal('.modal-preloader')`. See here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/dist/js/framework7.js#L3451\r\n`showPreloader()` is created with `.modal-preloader` class. Why close it using generic class name `.modal.modal-in`? Is there any reason? This is why it closes wrong modal if two modals are displayed (we had exactly such case). @ZanderBrown I just opened a PR on it as it is such a small change.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/1410 @macdonst Thank you!  when touch and hold the page slide down in the ios app, the navbar will go down, and not fixed at the top of the page.

But the same page in a particular application in different places can be loaded with `reload: true` as well as without `reload: true`, and in the first case `pageInit` will work correctly, in the second case \u2014 no. In the second case user can go farther through the screens, the page will be removed from DOM, then he hits back, back \u2014 and pageInit will trigger even if page was not shown yet (it only was initialized again and inserted to the DOM).\n\n(Practical example: I want to enable or disable side panel when one or another screens is shown.) \n\nOr, for example, now I use parameter `reload: true`, and later I may want to remove it. I must remember that I need to move my code related to page activation from pageInit to pageAfterAnimation. That may be OK for a small application to remember everyting, but if an application is large enough, it becomes hard to do that. Just some convenient event is needed. That\u2019s my vision.\n pageCenter and pageRefresh events can be added like this. We need refresh because during refresh pageBeforeAnimation does not trigger. We can not use init because sometimes init occurs even we dont see the page.\n\nfunction createPageCallback(callbackName) {\n    var capitalized = callbackName.replace(/^./, function (match) {\n        return match.toUpperCase();\n    });\n    myApp['onPage' + capitalized] = function (pageName, callback) {\n        return myApp.onPage(callbackName, pageName, callback);\n    };\n}\n\nvar pageCallbacksNames = ('center refresh').split(' ');\nfor (var i = 0; i < pageCallbacksNames.length; i++) {\n    myApp.pageCallbacks[pageCallbacksNames[i]] = {};\n    createPageCallback(pageCallbacksNames[i]);\n}\nfunction addPageTrigger(callbackName,pageData){\n    var capitalized = callbackName.replace(/^./, function (match) {\n        return match.toUpperCase();\n    }); \n    myApp.pluginHook('page'+capitalized, pageData);\n    if (myApp.params['onPage' + capitalized]) myApp.params['onPage' + capitalized](myApp, pageData);  \n    myApp.triggerPageCallbacks(callbackName, pageData.name, pageData);\n    $$(pageData.container).trigger('page'+capitalized, {page: pageData});  \n}\n$$(document).on('pageBeforeAnimation pageReinit pageRefresh', function (e) { \n    var pageData=e.detail.page;\n    addPageTrigger('center',pageData);\n});\n$$(document).on('pageInit ', function(e){\n\n```\nvar pageData=e.detail.page\n\nvar dataPageOnCenter=$$('.page-on-center').attr('data-page');\n\nif(dataPageOnCenter==pageData.name){\n    addPageTrigger('refresh',pageData);\n}   \n```\n\n});\n$$(document).on('pageCenter', function (e){\n    var page=e.detail.page.name;\n    console.log(page+' activated');\n\n});\n$$(document).on('pageRefresh', function (e){\n    var page=e.detail.page.name;\n    console.log(page+' refreshed');\n});\n  \u4f7f\u7528\u7528\u6d88\u606f\u680f\u65f6,\u5f39\u51fa\u952e\u76d8\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u540e,\u4f1a\u628a\u6574\u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u5411\u4e0a\u9876 \u8bf7\u95ee\u600e\u4e48\u89e3\u51b3\n\u5982\u4e0b\u56fe\n## ![img_1082](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427907/14986378/36b6391c-117e-11e6-83e6-0390d9d3332d.PNG)\n\n![img_1083](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9427907/14986392/42d9fa12-117e-11e6-9d74-7c3a654a6058.PNG)\n \u8bd5\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u9875\u9762\u5e03\u5c40   `<div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page navbar-fixed toolbar-fixed\">`\n @sy-ww-sun \u8fd9\u6837\u4e0d\u884c,\u8bd5\u8fc7\u4e86\n  After closing and opening, the console says: \n\n> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined framework7.js 8361 \n\nIt's this line:\n`var total = swiper.slides.length;`\n\nAnd the swiper object is an array in that moment, so it has not any attributes. \n  Currently the method to cancel Ajax forms submission is to call xhr.abort() in the 'beforeSubmit' event, as suggested by [\"this post\".](http://forum.framework7.io/#!/getting-started:cancel-ajax-form-submission) But that leads to an Uncaught InvalidStateError at the code line \"xhr.send(postData);\" (Failed to execute \u2018send\u2019 on xhr, for the object's state is no more OPENED). \n\nOn the orther hand, jQuery has a norm method for this: just let the callback at the \u2018beforeSubmit\u2019 event return false to prevent erroneous data from actually sending it to the server. That design may be needed for the next releases of Framework7.\n  Hello Framework7 Team,\n\nWe send the url (pushState: true) to google Analytics.\nBut when we use the back class link we can see that the app goes back in history and also the url shows this but we cannot find a javascript command like mainview.history that follows this url state.\nThe back class link does not remove the page from the history array and thus the back button does no trigger a analytics history path change.\n\nDo you have an idea how to do this?\nWe use the Google Tag Manager.\n\nKind regards,\nMario\n  Hello Framework7 team,\n\nWe would like to test/debug Google Tag Manager with Framework7. But when we enable the GTM preview setting we only get a blank screen.\nIs there a way to get this working?\n\nKind regards,\nMario\n  It seems that F7 ajax helpers generate an `ajaxError` event in case of any errors, including calls to undefined functions / usage of undefined variables (which typically happens because of a typo). jQuery ajax methods produce a nice error message with a stack trace in the console.\n\nAm I doing something wrong, or is it by design?

Create a virtual list.\n2. Append items to it.\n3. Delete all items.\n4. Append new items.\n\n**Expected results:**\nNew items should be rendered and shown.\n\n**Actual result:**\nNew items are added to \"items\" property of virtual list and yet not rendered and shown.\n\n**Additional info:**\nI'm using virtual list with dynamic height function and template property for rendering items.\n\nIf there is any more information needed I'll be glad to provide it.\n I have the same problem.\r\n\r\nIt delete only the first item of the list. Using deleteItem don't update display. Using update work only one.\r\n\r\nQuite problematic After some code reading and console.log usage, i think I understand what is happening in my case.\r\n\r\nI create a Virtual List and I use the callback \"renderItem\"\r\n\r\n`renderItem: function (index, item) {`\r\n\r\nOn my template for items, I inject the \"index\" value on a \"onclick\" action of an html element.\r\n\r\nSo, the deleteItem function in Framework7.js is called with index = 2 (i just pass index value without manipulate it).\r\n\r\nLook at the  console.log(index); I put near the \"splice\" function .\r\n\r\nThe console output \"20\" !! So splice is called with splice(20,1). \r\n\r\nThe 20 is \"built\" by  `index = index + indexShift;` line. It does 2 + 0 = 20 as text.\r\n\r\nTo have the good behaviour, I have to call deleteItem with a parseInt(index) parameter.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why the index value that was given by the `renderItem: function (index, item) {` callback must be \"parseInt\"ed \r\n\r\nI spent 2 hours understanding what happened.

I used swiper3.0.1(3.3.1 also same) in a page in my app, the css layout is messy, no problem  under F7 version1.4.0 ;\r\n2. Version 1.4.2 push State problems: cannot back to home page, init code as follows:\r\n```js\r\n    var myApp = new Framework7({\r\n        init: false,\r\n       pushState: true,\r\n    pushStateSeparator:\"\",\r\n       pushStateRoot:basePath,\r\n       pushStateOnLoad:false,\r\n    ...\r\n}); \r\n....\r\nmyApp.init();\r\n```\r\nIf set pushStateOnLoad:true, the problem back to home gone, but at the same in home page, data loaded by ajax in pageInit callback  cannot be shown in page. If  close pushState, the problem gone.\r\n\r\n3. Version 1.4.2  home page pageInit callback won't be called if  init code as follows:\r\n```js\r\n    var myApp = new Framework7({\r\n       init: true,\r\n       pushState: true,\r\n    pushStateSeparator:\"\",\r\n       pushStateRoot:basePath,\r\n       pushStateOnLoad:false,\r\n    ...\r\n}); \r\n```\r\n## Problems in Version 1.4.0\r\n\r\n2. pageInit callback of home page will be called twice likes:\r\n```js\r\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\r\n       init: false,\r\n       pushState: true,\r\n       pushStateSeparator:\"\",\r\n       pushStateRoot:basePath,\r\n        ...\r\n}); \r\n....\r\nmyApp.init();\r\n```\r\n2. data loaded by ajax in pageInit callback  cannot be shown in home page. If  close pushState, the problem gone.\r\n  When I swipe back, the `page.fromPage` in `onPageBeforeAnimation` is undefined. If I click back button instead, the `page.fromPage` is an object as expected.\n  Hi, there is an issue about closing cover panels ...See below for details \n\nWith a right cover effect panel, the behavior of closing panels was wrong sometimes. Specifically, the part of code on 'TransitionEnd' did not get executed. \nTherefore, the app ends with a state with the following characteristics: \n- The body element has a class of \"panel-closing\"\n- The panel overlay is visible \n- The cover panel is visible with 'display:block'\n- the UI is not responsive anymore (obvious)\n\nThe above scenarios occurred in Android systems...\n\nPlease investigate this issue...\nThanks.\nBest, \nXiaolong\n Same problem here with right panel. On the iPhone when you use swipe to open the panel about 25%, then hold it with your finger and double click on a menu item. The app goes to the new page and the view is stuck, the panel stays open and the view doesn't respond to clicks at all. Sometimes when you swipe and click to fast it also gets stuck!\n I have the same problem. After debugging I found that `closePanel` doesn't set `app.allowPanelOpen = true;`. All consequent `closePanel` requests have no effect because the condition:\r\n\r\n`app.closePanel = function () {`\r\n`            var activePanel = $('.panel.active');`\r\n`            if (activePanel.length === 0) return false;`\r\n`           ...`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n\r\nSo on panel open it exits right away because of the condition in `openPanel` method\r\n`app.openPanel = function (panelPosition) {`\r\n`            if (!app.allowPanelOpen) return false;`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\nIt seems  the logic of the `allowPanelOpen` flag is fragile. .\r\nAdding extra condition helped me, but I'm not sure if it defeats the purpose of the allowPanelOpen flag:\r\n`app.openPanel = function (panelPosition) {`\r\n`            if (!app.allowPanelOpen && $('.panel.active').length !== 0 ) return false;`\r\n\r\n\r\n After some time of debugging I found that mistake in app logic caused such behavior. Eventually all classes were removed from the body tag. Since the framework keeps record of panel states there, it broke the framework logic. Even if I didn't use the framework properly I think it would be great to add extra guard checks somewhere in order to make sure that the framework can survive or give a warning in such conditions.   **From the docs:**  http://framework7.io/docs/dom.html#ajax\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| crossDomain | `boolean` | When `true` additional \"X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\" header will be added to request. |\n\n**From the code:** https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/dom7-ajax.js#L195\n\n```\nif (!options.crossDomain) {\n    xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Requested-With', 'XMLHttpRequest');\n}\n```\n  Hello \n\nThis is a followup from issue #765\n\nI would like to propose a 'remove an option' method from a smartselect ( with or without virtual list )\n\nCurrently i am hacking away with the following code\n\n``` js\n$$('#mysmartselectid')[0].options.remove(INDEX)\n```\n\nThis works, and the smartselect component does it's job updating the select's popup.\n\nHowever I have noticed that the selected value does not update after I issue the command in the console, so I think it should have a function to remove options, in which a developer should opt from the following behaviors upon deleting:\n1. Select the next item in the list ( if there are no more items next then it should select the previous element.\n2. No selection. Clears the component and it's input.\n\nAnother feature request that would be great would be*\\* clearAll*\\* options from the smartselect component, so that we can update the list again without any problems.\n\nThis would be great because triggering 'myApp.initSmartSelects('#' + page);' does not seem right. I have checked the source code and I have the ability to choose an individual select but, at this time I have not tried it since deleting an option triggers the update in the select's popup.\n  i have an animated framework7 tab with 3 items , i want to hide the navbar when each of the tab item is scrolled i only had luck hiding the navbar after scrolling the first tab item.

Is it possible to make a very simple change to allow users to specify the initial src attribute on the image tags. I know there is imagesLazyLoadPlaceholder parameter but my page has varying image ratios which cause the page to jump when they load if they are not all a certain ratio. Some of my photos are 16x9 or 4x3 on one page etc. So I can't just set one placeholder image in imagesLazyLoadPlaceholder parameter.\n\nIn Framework7 1.4.2\n\nIf we change line 4295\n\n`if ($(this).attr('data-src')) $(this).attr('src', placeholderSrc);`\n\nto\n\n`if ($(this).attr('data-src') && !$(this).attr('src')) $(this).attr('src', placeholderSrc);`\n\nThis allows users to simply specify the image tag as follows and scales the placeholder image correctly. Where lazy-16x9.jpg is 16x9 pixels in size and lazy-4x3.jpg is 4x3 pixels in size.\n\n`<img data-src=\"path/to/main/img\" src=\"img/lazy-16x9.jpg\" class=\"lazy lazy-fadeIn\">\n<img data-src=\"path/to/main/img\" src=\"img/lazy-4x3.jpg\" class=\"lazy lazy-fadeIn\">`\n\nIt would be great if we could get this added?\n You could make this change on a fork and provide a pull request\n  Can we introduce the Windows Theme similar to ionic2.3?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/14373133/97298d86-fd64-11e5-9220-bf1689e810a7.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/14373150/b9b83078-fd64-11e5-8cfc-f04e4eab21bc.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/14373156/c5eb94d4-fd64-11e5-980f-7514312af364.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/14373164/d03c0f5e-fd64-11e5-8786-cff3538a00e7.png)\n @murliatdure \r\nThe windows market isn't very big and there are more important things to work on. \r\nIf you like you can make a pull request. \r\n\r\n@nolimits4web @ZanderBrown @valnub \r\nShould be closed.  @ZanderBrown \r\nOkay, let's see :)  As far as I remember there was Windows theme on the \"roadmap\" but it was so far down on the priority list, I am sure it will never happen unless Windows Phone wins 50% of the market.  Fixes #861.\nAdd conditional `&& !view.params.allowDuplicateUrls` when force==true and the url or pagename is the same.\nIn this way, the condition follow the same criteria used in router.load function, line 592.\n The modification fixes the issue #861 (there is a demo app showing the problem).\r\nThe modificatoin has sense because it follows the same logic implemented in app.router.load

The point is that with material theme the text doesn't align properly, and all text overlaps. How can i fix this ?\nAnd in general, the sliding transition with material theme doesn't works properly too.\n Example, screenshot or something more clear to understand?\n Sorry, the sliding effect that with ios theme works, with material theme doesn't. So, there will be some updating for material theme too ?\n Look at Material theme guides and tutorials on website. There is no sliding effect in Material theme\n Ok, i'm saying that would be nice to have that effetct on material. Btw, it doesn't matter.

Also prevented event bubbling, so other elements may open the picker on click without triggering HTML click\n\nI noticed there was a problem calling app.picker.open() if my picker's input is inside of a popup, but worked fine when clicking the input itself (all that is missing is the overlay, but that is not a problem). I added the openOnInput method to the picker so that the animation and correct positioning can happen through javascript. I also added e.stopPropagation, so that another element, such as an icon, can receive a click event and delegate handling the event to the picker without triggering HTML click (which closes the picker).\n\nThis is a workaround, but a question I had while writing this was why onInputOpen and picker.open were two separate methods?\n\nThanks,\nLawrence\n I believe that my problem is similar.\n\nThis code doesn't work:\n\n``` javascript\n$$('#my-button').on('click', function () {\n\n    var pickerDevice = myApp.picker({\n        input: '#selected-device',\n        cols: [\n            {\n                textAlign: 'center',\n                values: ['iPhone 4', 'iPhone 4S', 'iPhone 5']\n            }\n        ]\n    });\n    pickerDevice.open();\n\n});\n```\n\nOnly clicking on input tag can open picker. What is interesting is that, clicking #my-button adds picker to DOM, but picker is not visible. And more interesting is that on big screen (iPad) it opens it as popover, but as i mentioned earlier, in iPhone it is invisible.\n It's been a long time since I've looked at any of this, but I'll do my best to explain what was happening. I don't know how/where to view the merge conflicts and my suggestion is not to accept this pull request, but consider it as acknowledgement of an underlying issue and reason to refactor this part of the Framework7 Picker code (mainly point 1 below).\r\n\r\nThere were two objectives \r\n\r\n**1)** I wanted to open a picker by clicking a label or icon.\r\n\r\nMy initial attempt looked similar to @fox000 's example, as the docs state picker.open() opens the picker. This revealed that picker.open() did not handle adding padding to the parent container and scrolling to the input. Again, @fox000 mentioned this behavior. This is why I exposed openOnInput on the app.picker component. By calling picker.openOnInput directly I got all the styling and was happy.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\nvar picker = app.picker({\r\n      input: '#picker-device'\r\n      //...\r\n    });\r\n\r\n//...\r\n\r\n// - hacky, but shows our picker when superduper icon is clicked\r\n$$('.superduper-icon').on('click', function(){ picker.openOnInput(); }\r\n\r\n// - picker is off screen :(\r\n$$('.superduper-icon').on('click', function(){ picker.open(); } \r\n\r\n// - alternative without my changes for fox000 to try\r\n// - relies on knowledge of undocumented property 'picker.input' which is a Dom7 object.\r\n// - picker.input is derived from $(picker.params.input)\r\n$$('.superduper-icon').on('click', function(){ picker.input.trigger('click'); }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking a glance at what is on the master branch currently, I believe the original behavior I described is still happening. openOnInput is only called via a click event handler bound the picker's input (picker.js:494).\r\n\r\n**Lingering Question**\r\n\r\nIn my original comment I asked why onOpenInput and picker.open are two separate methods. This is really asking, when would we want to open (render) the picker without adding any of the styling to make it display properly?\r\n\r\n**2)** I wanted to show the picker from within a popup\r\n\r\nClicking a picker's input from within a popup could not find the popup to calculate the correct padding to add. This was fixed by add an additional selector to openOnInput when determining new styles to display the picker within the user's view.\r\n\r\n\r\n  for some reason my app used jquery.pjax.js , and it didn't work very well with pushState mode. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1625891/12953285/b466d954-d054-11e5-9933-165eeaa7151d.png)\n\nbecause both e.state are different.\nplease make them compatible such as \n\n```\nif (state.viewIndex === undefined || state.viewIndex < 0) return;\n```\n\nor better way.\nThanks!\n  I have a modal. I want to progressbar inside modal. This progressbar will be dynamic. I need to get this progressbar's id or class. For example : $$('#progressbar').attr('data-progress');\n please show some of your script\nCheers\n  When using the example of how to maintain Material and IOS in a single app from here:\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/tutorials/maintain-both-ios-and-material-themes-in-single-app.html\n\nThe title in the navbar in iOS starts uncentered.\n\nThis can be corrected by running `myApp.sizeNavbars('.view-main');`, but you can't do it right away as soon as the app is initialised. If you do it a tad later (say 'deviceready' in PhoneGap) then there is a visible \"jump\" when the title corrects to the center.\n\n![off-center-title](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/554999/12939528/a661e780-d014-11e5-86be-dea5aeaeb110.png)\n Interesting. This will clash with a Content Security Policy (that doesn't allow `'unsafe-inline'`), so I might personally look for a build-time solution just for those stylesheets. \n\nHowever, as a general fix for the guide, this looks like a good solution. Thanks :)\n Note: It turns out the snippet above can be used in an external JS file, as long as it is loaded before `my-app.js` as above.\n\n``` javascript\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/framework7.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/init-styles.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"my-app.js\"></script>\n```\n  It is not really necessary but it would be nice to send `removeDiacritics(query)` to `searchAll` and `searchByItem` also for Virtual List to have consistent behaviour with normal lists. Otherwise it should be mentioned in the documentation that it does not work for Virtual Lists. I do not know how about thisone `.trim().toLowerCase()`. That should probably remain onto the custom function to do it?\n BTW: The `removeDiacritics` is not accessible from outside, right? Would be a nice tool to have access to :).\n  > app.resizeTextarea = function (textarea) {\n>     textarea = $(textarea);\n>     if (!textarea.hasClass('resizable')) {\n>         return;\n>     }\n>    **textarea.css({'height': ''});**\n>     var height = textarea[0].offsetHeight;\n>     var diff = height - textarea[0].clientHeight;\n>     var scrollHeight = textarea[0].scrollHeight;\n> \n> ```\n> if (scrollHeight + diff > height) {\n>     var newAreaHeight = scrollHeight + diff;\n>     textarea.css('height', newAreaHeight + 'px');\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> };\n\nI just remove above bold line \"textarea.css({'height': ''});\", everything works fine though textarea size can not be decreased.\n http://codepen.io/Poordeveloper/pen/RrVOjq\n Exactly the same issue with my app with Cordova on iOS.

I have solved my issue on my own using 1st option. \n Hi @vaibhavch , i'm interested in your solution 'cause i can't solve that issue T.T  Just found a weird issue while testing my app on my device. Tapping on switch element crashes almost every time my iPhone 5S and iPad Mini 1st gen. I finally found that this did the trick:\n\n```\n.label-switch .checkbox:before {\n  display: none;\n}\n```\n\nIt seems like Safari doesn't like `transform: scale()` transitions on pseudo-elements... I'm curious if anyone encounters the same problem. I should precise that my app is pretty fat on memory at the moment :) But this only line of CSS resolved the issue.\n\nHope it helps someone in the future.\n On the simulator, there's only some kind of a little freeze.\n\nTested it on a real iPhone 5S and iPad Mini 1st gen with iOS 9.2.\n No problem, I guess I just encountered a very specific edge case. I'll close this and hope it helps someone else one day :)\n  Hi,\n\nI'm having issue when i click on the close button of the photobrowser as it triggers `jQuery.event add`  method after `close()` method is done which i want to avoid. After modifying the code as below, i was able to fix the issue. Is there a clean way to do it? Not sure why the `click event` is not captured in the `close` method. \n\n```\n           pb.close = function (e) {\n                // custom: add prevent default to avoid conflict jquery event after this method completes.\n                e.preventDefault();\n                pb.opened = false;\n                if (!pb.swiperContainer || pb.swiperContainer.length === 0) {\n                    return;\n                }\n                if (pb.params.onClose) {\n                    pb.params.onClose(pb);\n                }\n                // Detach events\n                pb.attachEvents(true);\n                // Delete from DOM\n                if (pb.params.type === 'standalone') {\n                    pb.container.removeClass('photo-browser-in').addClass('photo-browser-out').animationEnd(function () {\n                        pb.container.remove();\n                    });\n                }\n                // Destroy slider\n                pb.swiper.destroy();\n                // Delete references\n                pb.swiper = pb.swiperContainer = pb.swiperWrapper = pb.slides = gestureSlide = gestureImg = gestureImgWrap = undefined;\n            };\n```\n Well, i'm using only photobrowser  module of framework7 in an ionic+angular app. The integration with ionic+angular+photobrowser worked very well without any issue but when i click on the `close` anchor of photobrowser to close it, it closes but also the click event propagate to ionic framework and automatically triggers `back` method (could be due to position of  ionic's `back` anchor and photobrowser `close` are at same location) which unintentionally moves the page to previous page.  I want the click event to stop propagating right after the photobrowser closes. \n  @nolimits4web \n\n$$('form.ajax-submit').on('beforeSubmit', function (e) {  \n   if(!$$(\"#use_name\").val())\n    return false; \n});\n$$('form.ajax-submit').on('submitted', function (e) { \n    var xhr = e.detail.xhr;  \n    var json = e.detail.data; \n});\n\nHow to work with form submit ? .

How to i done with these functions (beforeSubmit , submitted) ?\n\nMay i know the details(or examples or demo ) of these functions submitted ,  beforeSubmit  ,  submitError\n yes :) \n  I don't know if this would be framework7 specific answer because of integration with the internal router or if it would be entirely generic html5 history solution - like supressing the default routing behavior somehow upon the onpopstate event?\n\nIs there a way to at certain points clear the (inline, hash) history stack?  Or possibly stack it in a desired way?\n- I use the left panel as a menu to switch modes and I don't want the user to be able to go back to a previous mode using swipe or back from that point - instead, the user should just open them panel menu again.  \n- Also, the user might navigate in a circle, I want to somehow detect this and shortcut the back history path with a more direct route.\n- The user might change some underlying data that makes a history item on the stack deleted or otherwise outdated and so going \"back\" through this page would be inappropriate.\n\nThanks!\n\nPS.  This library is awesome.  I showed a native iOS developer who didn't think hybrid apps could have decent performance and when I showed him he insisted that it must be some html-to-compiled tool I was using.  He was impressed with the smooth graphics/transitions/performance of this library when I told him it was just a webpage that I was hosting myself.\n Ok, thanks.  \n\nAnd I also think that the better answer is that modals and modals-containing-views is a better solution.  Only have pages for UI that will always exist (such as UI showing lists of things, even if that list is empty) and use popups for editing individual items (items which can be added or removed by the user).  When items themselves contain lists, their popup can be a view itself with further popups for individual sub-items.\n\nDo you agree that that approach is more natural and will scale?\n  In Whatsapp the \"date\" of a message is shown above the message in the middle of the screen and is fixed at the top while scrolling as long as messages within this date are available. This enhances the usability. Please provide a option to make this available within the component of framework7-messages. Thanks!!\n Yes, you are right. The \"sticky\"-thing is not a complex feature. \n\nHowever, it is not only about to stick the datetime on the top while scrolling all the messages within a datetime. The thing is, that grouping behaviour of datetime:\n\nFor example, having 4 messages with a different datetime but within the same day, then group these messages so that on top it is shown the word \"Yesterday\" instead of 4 different datetimes for each message with (1. Msg) 30.01.16 12.33, (2. Msg) 30.01.16 12.57, (3. Msg) 30.01.16 13.46, (4. Msg) 30.01.16 14.21. I think, this is a good feature. I know, F7 is not a WP replica and should not be. However, maybe you think also, that this is a nice feature and would enhance the messaging component of F7. A property like \"groupMessageByDate\" can be there to enable it.\n  I'm using **Framework7** alongside with **AngularJS** for a SPA app. I have a `.left-panel` with links to other \"pages\". When I navigate to one of those, the expected behavior was that the left-panel would close (it closes) but it doesn't remove the `.with-panel-left-cover` class from the body tag and I can't seem to click at any of other stuff in the loaded \"page\".\nLooking at [panel.js#L45](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/panels.js#L45)\nI can see the class is added on `appOpenPanel(panelPosition)` function but not removed on `app.closePanel()` function [panel.js#L66](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/panels.js#L66).\n\nAm I doing something wrong or is it something that should be fixed in code?\n\nThanks!\n  https://github.com/vitalets/x-editable\n- adding as 'a'  for elements - doesn't respond\n- adding as controls (text/textarea), the editable works but the updated values are not reflecting.\n\nCan you please assist me for the same.\nThanks,\n  http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/photo-browser.html#photo-browser-methods-properties\nPhotoBrowser doesn't have **activeSlideIndex** property  update it to new **activeIndex** property\n  Framework7 is a really great framework, I very like it, but when I run it on android, the animation is very slow.\nI saw the animation is based on css3, then I test an animation js tool - Velocity.js\uff0cI found it have high performance on mobile.\nCan Velocity.js instead css3 animations in framework7?\n It is a well-known fact, that JS animations can have a much better performance (if done the proper way) than CSS animations. I was wondering too when I read that F7 uses CSS animations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, F7 is a great framework, especially because it is able to integrate with other libraries. I use it with riot.js and after finding out how to use the routers together, it's just awesome.  Is it possible to get the floating button working with the iOS theme?\n Working well if I include floating-button.less and comment out the check as per the code below:\n\n```\n        //if (app.params.material) {\n          if (clicked.hasClass('floating-button') && clicked.parent().hasClass('speed-dial')) {\n            clicked.parent().toggleClass('speed-dial-opened');\n          }\n          if (clicked.hasClass('close-speed-dial')) {\n            $('.speed-dial-opened').removeClass('speed-dial-opened');\n          }\n        //}\n```\n  I am trying to combine both Autocomplete and Searchbar components. \n\nRequiement:-\n- Ajax Autocomplete in Search Bar.\n\nI have already tried to include ajax json autocomplete component with search bar. But i found it difficult as they are both using different css.\n\nPlease help me with initial template code so that i can manage to finish the complete task.\n  http://codepen.io/Poordeveloper/pen/RrVOjq\n\nplease click on \"second page\", on second page, the tabbar is not really undisplayed, you can see it after scrolling down.\n  Any plan to make it works for all views? \n  Hi, I'm using meteor with react and react router. Is there way to integrate framework7 into react router? So far I only found this, but it's using iron router https://github.com/nicooprat/meteor-framework7-routing\n I have thought about this, eventually I chose f7's routers, I love its page transition implementations. However, its pushState only works on main view, this forces me to think about writing my own history implementation. Anyway, to make f7 work fine on react, you must do a lot of hacks.\n  Well the behavior is documented, but I think that is a really bad practice in terms of modularity. \n\n_As you may see the Material layout is almost the same. It just has different CSS files related to Material theme, and a bit different page structure where Navbar and Toolbar are inside of the page_\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/app-layout.html#basic-android-material-app-layout\n\nFor example, I have an app with the old structure where only ios style is available. \n\nNow the migration to make the app compatible visually with android and IOS is a completely pain, since the structure changes, and implies strong modifications in includes and page structure. The ideal behavior should be only something like this:\n\n```\nif (getMobileOperatingSystem() === 'iOS') {\n    console.log('ios');\n    document.write('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{url_for(\"static\", filename=\"css/framework7.ios.min.css\")}}\">');\n    document.write('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{url_for(\"static\", filename=\"css/framework7.ios.colors.min.css\")}}\">');\n} else {\n    console.log('android');\n    document.write('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{url_for(\"static\", filename=\"css/framework7.material.min.css\")}}\">');\n    document.write('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{url_for(\"static\", filename=\"css/framework7.material.colors.min.css\")}}\">');\n}\n```\n\nWell the summary is, the page structure should be the same for both styles, in terms of cleaning, migration and future modularity, in my opinion.\n  Ok, and cancel for modals should work with keyboard Esc and return keypress\n Well actually it's so good I use it for web stuff as well!\nBut seriously there is a return button on the prompt modal and it should work and if you do that you might as well add Esc so it can be used for web stuff without being really hacky.  \n I'm also thinking about using F7 on a responsive project, and basic keyboard actions could be really useful, eg. up/down + enter on autocomplete results. As you said, it's \"mobile-first\", not \"mobile-only\" :) It's especially the best frontend framework I know, that feature is one of the few missing to be perfect!\n  Hello.\nFirst of all, thank you so much for the super awesome Framework 7!\nFast, smooth and clean!\n\nMy page structure using Template7:\n\nIndex \n-> Category1\n----> Post1\n----> Post2\n-> Category2 \n----> Post3\n----> Post4\n----> Post5\n\nCategory pages can be opened either from Index page or from Left Panel:\n\nIf I am now on Category1 page and tap link from Left Panel on Category2, I have to force reload Category2 page  (data-reload=\"true\"), otherwise nothing happens.\n\nProblem is:\nWhen I use link from Left Panel, Back Button (either h/w or in Navbar) stops working so I can't back to Index page, works only Post -> Category (Like history is almost cleared). \nIf I don't use data-reload=\"true\" in Left Panel links, everything works great.\n\nThanks in advance.\n Thanks for quick answer!\n\nBut I have a problem with refreshing template:\nWhen I'm on category.html page (for example, category1), and try to load other data (category2) tapping on Left Panel link, nothing happens without data-reload=\"true\"\n http://27podarkov.ru/f7/ - version WITH data-reload=\"true\" in Left Panel\nhttp://27podarkov.ru/f7b/ - version WITHOUT data-reload=\"true\" in Left Panel\n\nYou may open left panel on any page swipePanelActiveArea: 50\n Thank you VERY much!\nBest wishes to you and your projects!\n  unable to place the fab on navbar - \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/12228590/b0d5b61a-b863-11e5-86eb-34b0de5ff7c6.png)\n\nz-index  doesn't react on any combinations - position and z-index etc.\n Planning for the header & FAB relative to long header - on scroll the FAB will be attached to the navbar, please have a look at screenshots.\n\n![xcxe0](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/12346269/e954b50a-bb78-11e5-880b-ab7f8a2909d3.png)\n![components_subheaders4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/12346271/ead61144-bb78-11e5-9b09-ba03d6e1fa13.png)\n  I have not edited or tweaked anything with the original material accordion component. Please see my screencast video so that you will come to my issue better.\n\nhttp://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cDVX14hpfe\n\nAfter clicking the accordion. its not opening. its opening and closing  in a fraction of milli seconds.\n kitchen sink demo is working fine. All js,css files for both my project and kitchen sink are same.  No, I have not tested in real device. But  \"accordion-item-expanded\"  css class is not appending in my project while it does in kitchen sink demo.\n http://goo.gl/NNQAar   Click on \"daily products\" menu to see accordion.\n Very Thanks.! \n  I would like to have the control over the transitions in either the material or ios theme, I understand they are designed to look like native, but some (cool) apps might need to have more control over the page transitions. So page transitions might be pulled out of the two themes and be available as a separate feature?\n\nSo I think it might be a good idea to:\n- keep the page transitions as a separate build task, so you can choose which type of transitions you want in your theme. In app initialization a new option can be added to specify default transition for all pages.\n- (optionally) also be able to create one's own page transitions in a separate css that can be included in  custom build.\n- (optionally) allow transition for each page to be specified by overriding the default transition set in app initialization, so for example, I might open one page in the app using a separate transition for some reason...\n\n@nolimits4web what do you think? \n Fair enough :)\n  Tested: Sumsung S3 (Android 4.3.), Genymotion emulator Android 4.1.1.\n Have you tested \"dataset()\" on PhoneGap Build?\n Yes.\n\nVery simple example: \n[example-web.zip](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/files/87335/example-web.zip)\n\nExample of PhoneGap Build Project: \n[example-phone-gap.zip](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/files/87336/example-phone-gap.zip)\n\nAPK by PhoneGap Build: \n[example-debug.zip](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/files/87338/example-debug.zip)\n\nTested:\nWindows browsers: OK\nGenymotion Android 4.4.4 (Galaxy S5): OK\nGenymotion Android 4.1.1 (Galaxy S3): BAD\nAndroid 4.4.2 (Lenovo device): BAD\nAndroid 4.3 (Samsung Galaxy S3 device): BAD\n\nSorry for my English.\n  `template` parameter has been removed in below commit\n\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/7a9f8898fbaa13b61a024c385463c8bc54d150ea#diff-58a03374079568ecefec70f988073d0bL77\n\nBut it's still in your document\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/photo-browser.html\n\nIs it removed by accident or your document is just not the latest?\n  I previously requested a feature similar to this in the forums (\"View noHistory option\").  What I'm looking for is some way to reset the page history.  I provided two scenarios in that post, but another one is:\nI have an app that has a logged in/out state.  The user can navigate several pages deep into the page hierarchy.  When they become logged out (either because their session times out or because they click a \"logout\" button available in the UI) I display the special login view.  After they log back in, though, the previous view (potentially multiple pages deep) is displayed again.  Instead, I need to take them back to the \"home\" page. \n\nI've tried using app.mainView.router.back({ url: 'home.html', force: true }) but that only pops one page off the history stack.  Similarly, app.mainView.router.load({ url: 'home.html' }) doesn't clear the history stack.  Both options load the \"home\" page, but leave the previous pages in the history.\n\nIs there any way to clear the page history using existing functionality?  If not, would it be possible to add a \"reset\" option to the back/load methods to do this?\n Thanks! Using the history object for the url value was the trick.  I hadn't thought of that.  Evidently, the URLs I'd tried HAD NOT matched and that was the problem (this is the home page so its wasn't clear before I looked at mainView.history[0] whether url should be '/', 'index.html', 'http:/my.site.com', or something else; using the history array is foolproof, though).\n  hide tabbar\n  WayPoint Sticky is working with Framework7\n\nhttps://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints \n\nvar waypoint = new Waypoint.Sticky({\n      element: $('.basic-sticky-example')[0], //document.getElementById('trigger-point-example'),  \n      handler: function(direction) {\n          //console.log($(this));\n          console.log('Trigger point: ' + this.triggerPoint)\n      },\n      offset : 'bottom-in-view'\n        //offset: 'right-in-view'\n    });\n\nApplying offset as number/perc is not responding.\n\nAlso window.scrollY is always '0' - F7 pages.\n\nCan you please assist me on this.\n Unable to get the scrollY on page-content element.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/12227351/50348be0-b851-11e5-9391-f91ebf32e804.png)\n\nDo we have some simpler options for handling the same?\n    Hi,\nI'm developing an iOS/Android app that uses the new autocomplete component but while on iOS it works perfectly, on Android when I tap on a value the dropdown list disappear with nothing selected.\nThis behaviour occurs both on physical device and on emulator (Genymotion).\n Genymotion:\n- Android v. 4.1.1 & v.5.1.0\n\nReal device with v.4.2.1\nYes, I've tested also the Kitchen Sink in fullscreen and got the same error.\n  I can get query via page.query, but window.location.href does not show the string. This is useful when somebody wanna share the page.\n I have enabled pushState, when I clicked on \u201c#cars?id=100\u201d, I can see localhost:3000/#!/#cars on browser, but there is no ?id=100 part, however I can got id=100 from page.query. I do need the query string shown on href so that some one can share the page correctly.\n  I can't use any rich text editor in Framework7, no matter `<div contenteditable=\"true\"></div>` or `<iframe></iframe>`\n Thank you for replying so fast. It works when added `no-fastclick` class. `<iframe></iframe>` also works without that. I made a mistake.\n  Using lists with Swipeouts inside Popups causes unexpected behaviour.\n\nThis is because the Swipeout `close` event collides with the `close` event consumed by the Popup causing the popup to close on Swipeback. My recommendation would be to namespace these events having for instance `swipeout:close` etc.\n  .searchbar-input{width:100%;height:28px;position:relative;-webkit-flex-shrink:1;-ms-flex:0 1 auto;flex-shrink:1}\n\nin wechat browser, \"cancel' button on the right side can not be shown. I solved with below change.\n\n.searchbar-input2 {\n    -webkit-box-flex: 1;\n    -webkit-flex: 1;\n    -ms-flex: 1;\n    flex: 1;\n    height: 28px;\n    position: relative;\n}\n  When you create a modal using JavaScript, it would be nice to have the ability to attach an `open` event listener immediately. This can, for example, be of help when you want to fill the contents of a 'prompt-like' input field.\n\nI have something like this in mind:\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.modal({\n  title: 'Prompt',\n  text: 'Enter some text',\n  onOpen: function(modal) {\n    $$(modal).find('input[type=\"text\"]').val('some preset prompt value');\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOr perhaps I am missing something, and would something like this already be possible using the current API.\n  It would be nice to have the ability to fill the virtual list with some text, when it has no items.\n Why not a creation attribute like this?\n\n``` javascript\nf7.virtualList('.selector', {\n  items: [],\n  emptyTemplate: '<li>'+\n        '<a href=\"#\" class=\"item-content item-link\">'+\n          '<div class=\"item-inner\">'+\n              '<div class=\"item-title\">You can add an item by clicking the plus icon on the right top.</div>'+\n          '</div>'+\n       '</a>'+\n   '</li>'\n});\n```\n\nFlexible and pretty simply reusable.\n  I have a swiper in a popup.  If I put the swiper in a `.page`, it works fine, but if I move it to a `.popup`, it still mostly initializes but the bullets and paging work as if there's only one slide.  The second slide _is visible_ if you drag, but you can't actually swipe to it - it just snaps back.  It is the only swiper in the app.\n\nI've tried adding a `.page-content` wrapper to the popup but that doesn't seem to be what it needs.\n\nIs there a workaround?\n Awesome, thanks!  \n\nShould the `.swiper-init` be honored in this situation (as a bug?)\n  I put my app initialization file into a separate module, something like this:\n![blahadsf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7194216/12057606/b4189a66-af7d-11e5-89fd-a12041617e44.PNG)\n\nThen I required the module into the main.js, and set up the event listener like this(all my pages are inlined)\n![balh](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7194216/12057644/04e3b80e-af7e-11e5-8823-6eff04dfcc39.PNG)\n\nBUT, it can't listen to page events.\n @nolimits4web Sir can you help me with this?\n Yes sir. I had a look at it already. \nWhen I use \n\n```\n$(document).on('pageBeforeInit') \n```\n\ninside of my module for example, it will detect that event, but when I use App.onPageBeforeInit() it's not working\n @nolimits4web I will make a demo later on sir, so that you can check. Thank you\n @nolimits4web Sir, my code is similar to this http://www.idangero.us/framework7/tutorials/mobile-mvc-apps-with-framework7-requirejs-and-handlerbars.html. I did not have a time to make a demo today, maybe later on after my work. But, for now sir maybe you take a look at that. Please. Thank you.\n @nolimits4web Sir, here's my test app, btw I'm also using knockout.js for the component, and databindings\n\nI inlined my pages so that knockout can bind on those pages, knockout can't bind on dynamically created page. I also used the ko's component to make a component of each page, (e.g. <index-page></index-page> to clean things up as I'm using inline pages.\n\nThe other issue I've found is, when I access a page for example about page, and when I click the back button, it's not working. Maybe it's an issue with knockout? Or require?\n\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4yi3z3m3Q53OWVTaEtBcHZVcGM\">Link to test app</a>\n @nolimits4web  Sorry sir. Here's the updated <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4yi3z3m3Q53OWVTaEtBcHZVcGM/view?usp=sharing\">link</a>.\n\nFramework7 seems like it does not like knockout.js component binding sir. I made another simple app just now without it and everything works.\n  ![subheader](http://m0.joe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/28153311/t4.jpg)\n\nsee the \"online\" label on under the Header\n  I'm trying this, but no success:\n\n`myApp.onPageInit('social', function (page) {\nmyApp.showIndicator();`\n$$.ajax({`\nurl: 'http://facebook.com',`\nmethod:'GET',`\ndataType:'html',`\nsuccess: function(data, status) {`\nmyApp.hideIndicator();`\n$$('#tabfacebook').html(data);`\n},\nerror: function(result, status) {\nmyApp.hideIndicator();\nmyApp.alert('Ocorreu um erro ao carregar o facebook:'+status, 'Ops!');\n}\n});\n});`\n  Add an alphabetical index scrollbar for contacts list. I am not good at designing, so the style may not look very nice.\n OOOOOH~~, I really do not know that there is another plugin exist. I write this plugin in my own project by myself.\n  I came across this problem when adding emojis to a message field - emojione converts into images, which are embedded in the message text.  However, the css for message-pic doesn't play well with text, which makes sense.  I thought it appropriate to add in another field to determine not only if there is an image anywhere in the text, but if it is the beginning (and assumed to be the only significant text, so we can apply message-pic).  For me, I disable autoLayout and use onlyImage to add message-pic class to the messages display like this, and it works well.\n Sure, it was to fix an issue I was having and wasn't sure it warranted a generic change but wanted to leave that up to you.  In my original comment I mentioned having an emoji picture inline with text caused the message text field to be displayed incorrectly because it found an image within the text field.  Really, it seems that message-pic should be applied only if there is a picture, and not if there is text other than a picture.  I'll try to get screenshots later.\n ![hasimage ios](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/635145/12179817/073214c4-b547-11e5-868f-74816341939c.PNG)\n![onlyimage ios](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/635145/12179816/07306836-b547-11e5-90c5-e54ff19dadef.PNG)\n\nI hope the attachments make sense.  The first one uses hasImage, and the background turns to white and you can't see the text.  The second image uses onlyImage, and the background is present and the text visible.\n I made another commit to show where the issue is affected, in the messages template.

This page will be loaded when you click about.html link from Left view ...\n  </div>          \n</div>\n```\n Is the Kitchen Sink example available online?\nAnd which example in particular shoul I look at?\n\nAnd about \"hide main tab bar toolbar\": What is the best way to only hide the toolbar for a specific page?\nThus if we go to another page it is showing again?\n So basically it is just: use the classes: no-toolbar and toolbar-fixed\n \"need to add extra style/class to this page's toolbar to keep it visible \"\nwhich ones?\nIndeed I don't see the toolbar.\n I cannot spot extra style/class in your example.\n Aha. So there is some puzzling todo.\nI have to find out which [data-page=\"tabbar\"] style does the trick.\nAnd if I have more \"custom\" toolbar pages I probably will create a class for this?\nI am not complaining about your excellent framework but I can presume this is a common request?\n I think I have got it.\nNot a big deal after all if you know the trick.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nOne last Q for today:\nWhen would you suggest using views instead of inline pages?\n\nKind regards,\nMario\n  When you enable RTL mode the TABs on Material Design are not being highlighted. Only the first tab is highlighted and the animation is done from the wrong direction.\n\nAlso the animated tabs won't show the content, only the content of the first one.\n\n![tabs_rtl_bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8502129/11392498/748e5780-935a-11e5-836a-83b0d283dbce.gif)\n Absolutely. In fact that is the kitchen sinc from the website. \n *sink\n Just download the kitchen sink and add the material rtl css. Go to tabs and you will see it. \n I see that behavior in both Safari for Mac OSX and iPhone... I will wrap a project and upload it. \n Ok, sorry about that, the problem is with my implementation... I detect that it is using a rtl language during the runtime and append the rtl css to the head. However because the app was previously initiated the transitions will not work as expected...\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nBTW, congratulations for this awesome framework ;)\n Thank you Vladimir. I will change the logic to the app and initialize it after add the RTL CSS.\n\nSorry about this time wasted! :-/\n  It would be cool if we could have scrolling tabs with Framework7 just like in most of the android applications.\n Ok thanks, I didn't see that before.\n  with pushState there is no way for URL to contain the query\n with pushState, add query into url, like \"#profile?id=1\" for direct page access\n This is because the URL like `/#!/#about?a=b` doesn't have much sense. But that `a=b` page query is still available in Page Data object where you can access it\n  Hi. I'm use F7, and few days ago I noticed the error. Using hide toolbar on scroll page function parallel with styles /framework7.material.css, toolbar slideUp instead slideDown. \n\nI fix this problem change\n.toolbar.toolbar-hidden:not(.messagebar){\n   -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,-100%,0);\n   transform:translate3d(0,-100%,0)\n}\non\n.toolbar.toolbar-hidden:not(.messagebar){\n   -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,100%,0);\n   transform:translate3d(0,100%,0)\n}\nSo now it works.\n\nP.S. Thank you for so good & smart framework!\n  - current way is responsive to pre-assigned, meant if you have 2 columns, it would be 2 columns on both phone and tablet. What I meant here is if you have 320px and 1920px width of 2 devices, it just always display 2 columns. The responsiveness to the screens should be 12 columns on 1920px screens but remaining 2 columns in 320px screen.\n\nSmall screen break points\n\n```\n|||\n|||\n|||\n```\n\nBig screen break points\n\n```\n|||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n|||||||||||||\n```\n  How to use the logo in framework7.

We tried your tutorial in every possible way (except the right one obviously) but we did not succeed to get it working.\nHowever we need to use the searchbar/result list with data from a local/remote database and we found an excellent example called \"FW7_Autocomplete-master\" which also was very helpfull understanding the template7 features.\n\nBut thanks for the excellent Framework it has great features and the inline page content was just what I was looking for ;-)\n\nBut while I have got your attention:\nOne example I am missing is \"video\" In our present solution we have got quite an issue showing Vimeo movies in the Android devices. In some it works and in some it just does not.\nIf you have got some material for me I would appreciate this.\n\nAnother thing is \"sending json data to the next page\". I have read in some post that sending between pages is only possible with strings. Now we have solved it using javascript calling the same data again in the new page.\nWe tried using \"Template7.registerHelper('stringify', function (context){ return JSON.stringify(context[0]); });\nBut that did not seem to work return anything.\nCan you advise the best way to send json to the next page ? We call the link from inside a template.\n\nKind regards,\nMario\n The last question I also asked in the following post: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Template7/issues/4 \n  IgnoreCache flag should not cause the clear cache functionality to be ignored. Otherwise UI gets the old cached version on next request.\n  when you're on a page, it's impossible to follow a link which is pointing on the same page with differents query arguments, is it normal?\n  F7 using hair line css is  :after.   is bad for rendering performance.\nI suggest use:\n@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {\n.listItemClassName {\n    background-position: left top;\n    background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear,left bottom,left top,color-stop(0.5,transparent),color-stop(0.5,#e0e0e0));\n    background-repeat: repeat-x;\n    -webkit-background-size: 100% 1px;\n}\n}\n Well, I've been tested on some of the old Android devices, and it's a practical background thread that makes the whole page scroll more fluid.\nBut this is the case for most of the next year, as China's handheld devices are out of hand.\n  Setting uniqueHistory: true seems to bring problems when user navigates more than once on a given route. When going back, it clears the cached DOM and shows blank page. You can experience it here: https://github.com/mishoboss/meteor-react-framework7/\n\nGo to settings and go through the tabs several times. Then go back.\n  Scrollbar scroller goes behind navbars and toolbars. Also it is noticeable if additional paddings applied to pages.\n Thanks for the info. Yes, seems logical. I applied custom CSS to fix this in cases when no backdrop or transparent navbars are needed. Also not needed for Material design.\n Is it possible to introduce an option for showing proper scrollbar without having those features?\nI'm showing quite large amount of text in Material Design and this beheaded scrollbar doesn't feel good.\n  page.navbarInnerContainer is undefined when using material\n  ```\n// Initialize your app\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    pushStateRoot: pushStateRoot,\n    //global: true,\n    init: true,\n    modalTitle: 'Framework7',\n    animateNavBackIcon: true,\n\n    pushState: true,\n    pushStateSeparator: \"\",\n    pushStateNoAnimation: true,  //\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3atrue,\u5426\u5219\u9875\u9762\u5237\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4f1a\u5148\u5207\u6362\u4e00\u4e0b\n    pushStatePreventOnLoad: false, //\u4f7f\u7528require.js\u5219\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3afalse\n\n    preloadPreviousPage: false,\n\n    //statusbarOverlay: statusbarOverlay,\n    scrollTopOnStatusbarClick: true,\n\n    scrollTopOnNavbarClick: true,\n\n    swipeBackPage: false, //\u5f00\u542f/\u5173\u95ed\u6ed1\u52a8\u8fd4\u56de\u4e0a\u4e00\u9875\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n```\n\n};\n\n```\n// Export selectors engine\nvar $$ = Dom7;\n\n// Add main View\nvar mainView = myApp.addView('.view-main', {\n    // Enable dynamic Navbar\n    dynamicNavbar: false,\n    // Enable Dom Cache so we can use all inline pages\n    domCache: true,\n    //pushStateSeparator: \"\"\n});\n```\n\nThe key code lines are  \n1. swipeBackPage: false,\n2.  dynamicNavbar: false,\n\nThen it will cause the error: Cannot read property 'addClass' of undefined  in the router.js from line \n541.\n thank you for fixing it.\n  Seems like the new material `chips` component is not available in gulp custom build script.\n\n```\nFramework7 git:(master) \u2717 gulp custom -chips\n[17:57:56] TypeError: Cannot read property 'dependencies' of undefined\n```\n Good enough \ud83d\udc4d\n  Hi, I'm trying to build a glorious combo of Meteor, React, Framework7. My only problem is combining Framework7 with React without using AJAX loaded pages. What I do is having a onClick listener on all links that have \"data-page\" attribute. On clicking I load some very simple page markup to a view:\n\n```\n\n    $$(document).on('click', 'a[data-page]', function(e) {\n      var link = $$(e.target);\n      if (!link.is('a[data-page]')) {\n        link = link.parents('a[data-page]');\n      }\n\n      var page = link.attr('data-page'); \n      var view = link.attr('data-view');\n      var container;\n      if(view){\n        if(view == 'leftView'){\n          container = leftView;\n        } else {\n          container = mainView;\n        }\n      } else {\n        container = mainView;\n      }\n      container.router.load({\n          content: '<div class=\"page with-subnavbar\" data-page=\"' + page + '\"></div>'\n        });\n    }, true);\n```\n\nThen on F7 pageInit event I hooked a React render functions that renders a React Class into the already loaded page markup.\n\n```\nf7.onPageInit('*', function(page) {\n      if(page){\n        ReactDOM.render(Utils.pages.getPage(page.name), page.container);\n      }\n    });\n\n```\n\nThis approach works. However it has issues.There are many things happening in F7 app.router._load() function that can't apply to the not yet fully created DOM at the time of load() call (because React element renders after it). So, stuff like navbars is not handled correctly.\n\nDo you have any idea how could this be done in a better way? Any way to \"reinitialize\" the page after React renders? Thanks!\n Hi, I tried to pass to \"content\" property an already rendered DOM and a pushState error came. You put the whole content into the state and when it is a DOM, it gives error. When I disable the pushState option, it works. However React is not able to update the DOM anymore, because app.router._load() manipulates the DOM and React gives error in that case. React does not expect anything other to manipulate the DOM. :( Any ideas are really, really welcome!\n Hi, I prepared a good code for tests here: https://github.com/mishoboss/meteor-react-framework7/\nPlease, install Meteor, put the contents somewhere and run \"meteor\" command. It will get and install all necessary components and will run Meteor. Inside the app I've described the problem and there is a showcase. Thanks!\n Thanks. I'll check it now. What about the pushState issue when passing DOM in \"content\" property? Please, set pushState:true and you will see the error.\n\nI was thinking if it is possible to develop the F7 in a way to respect React life cycle naturally? You have made it for Template7. It would be really cool to also handle React out of the box. This will have a major positive reaction for F7. Do you think it is possible? I'm ready to help with wathever I could.\n So far, so good. I'm organising now the code in a beautiful and logical \"framework\". One thing though. I saw you have added \"page.navbarInnerContainer\", which is good. But can we also have \"page.navbarContainer\"? The idea is that React's Class render function can have just one root tag. So, I have to add a wrapping DIV element right below .navbar-inner element and this breaks some CSS. I can get it programatically, but it would be more beautiful if it is provided in the page object. Thanks!\n There were problems with React hooking on navbarContainer and looks like having a nested `<div class=\"navbar-inner\">` is not a problem for F7. So the above is solved. However, another issue came and I would like to ask you to take a look, as it is F7 related. Please, pull the changes from the repo. Run the app and click the \"gear icon\"in the upper right corner. Then click \"Back\". The navbar disappears. Do you have any idea why?\n Unfortunately no way to avoid it. React wants only one root element. In case of multiple elements, it expects them to be wrapped in a parent element: https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/maximum-number-of-jsx-root-nodes.html\n\nSo, I end up with this that applies on already available navbar-inner:\n\n```\nReact.createClass({\n      render () {\n        return (\n          <div className=\"navbar-inner\">\n            <div className=\"left\">\n              <a href=\"#\" data-panel=\"left\" className=\"menu-panel-btn link open-panel icon-only\">\n                <i className=\"icon icon-bars\"></i>\n              </a>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"center sliding\">App</div>\n            <div className=\"right\">\n              <a data-page=\"settings\" data-view=\"mainView\" className=\"link icon-only\">\n                <i className=\"icon ion-android-settings\"></i>\n              </a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    })\n```\n\nAny ideas are welcome.\n It was good to be handled by React and have reactivity in cases with toolbar buttons with submenus in popovers. If its not possible, static HTML is always a fallback possibility.\n Thanks for the hint. I know this app, but they use custom router and requireJS. However they did a nice trick by introducing a .navbar-wrapper class that solves the style issues:\n\n```\n.navbar .navbar-wrapper {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  padding: 0 8px;\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\n  display: -webkit-flex;\n  display: flex;\n  -webkit-box-pack: justify;\n  -ms-flex-pack: justify;\n  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe problem with the the dissapeared navbar on Back now is gone! :) Thanks for the hint! :)\n Another issue found and I'm not sure why it happens. When going back in router, it only shows just one page back. Then it shows blank pages. I have pushed changes to the repo and you can reproduce it easily: https://github.com/mishoboss/meteor-react-framework7/\n You nailed it! :)\n But this means that all the DOM stays forever in the browser. It would be a problem for huge apps. Why does the router needs to cache DOM in order to be able to goes back?\n  Somehow i'm finding it impossible to send an ajax request with JSON post data. Whatever settings i choose in ajax config object it always converts it to form data\n thnx\n  I am trying to use the \"Through\" Layout, which the Navbar should stay the same through different pages. But I cannot make it work. Test link: http://demo.medcomhk.net/f7-test/\n\nI have checked the examples in the Framework7 Docs. In \"Navbars & Toolbars Layout\" > \"Through\" Layout\", the \"Hello\" and \"World\" links I suppose should demonstrate linking to other pages have no response.\n\nIn \"Mixed\" Layout, there is a typo: &lt;div class=\"pages navbar-through fixed-through\"&gt; should be &lt;div class=\"pages navbar-through toolbar-fixed\"&gt;\n\nIn \"Cheat sheet\" > \"Fixed\", .pages.navbar-fixed.navbar-through should be .pages.navbar-fixed.navbar-fixed.\u3000\n  Hi everyone!\nNow I try use yandex map api inside framework7 project.\nBut,  if js is not in app.js it  will be ignored.\nI have one question: how I can include  `<script src=\"https://api-maps.yandex.ru/2.1.29/?lang=ru_RU\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>` in framework7 project and work with it?\n  For example :I want to go back to page1 from page2 and refresh page1\n\n```\nmyApp.onPageBeforeAnimation('page1', function (page){\n\n  if (page.from === 'left') {\n       page.view.router.refreshPage();\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBut page1 cant`t refresh .Why? @nolimits4web\n **Refresh your page first and then go back** I have tried to use \n\n```\npage.view.router.refreshPreviousPage()\n```\n\nand then use a go back function,But it can only refresh and it cant`t go back.Because it dont`t know when it refresh completely. And when the data is refreshing,it run go back. The real reason I don`t know.\n\nSo I want to go back first and then refresh.\n\n**I can`t understand your second suggest** ,can you tell me more detailedly.\nI use \n\n```\n<a class=\"back\" data-ignore-cache=\"true\" data-force=\"true\">back</a>\n```\n\nBut it can`t work too. For example : \nMy navigation is   Page1 -> Page2 -> Page3 \nI want to go back to Page2, but when I use the code , it go back to Page1 from Page3.\n\nCan you help me? @nolimits4web\n Thanks.\nThe solution is \n\n```\npage.view.router.back({\n                    url: xxxxx,\n                    force: true,\n                    ignoreCache: true\n                })\n```\n But if previous page is a dynamic page like: mypage.html?id=01 and the url is unknow???\n I have the same problem as **noveweb** mentioned.\nPage1 is a page with xhr content loaded (In pageInit function)\n\nWhen the page is navigating from page2 back to page1,\n- using data-load-previous=\"true\" with 'back' class does not reload the previous page\n- by only using data-load-previous=\"true\" load the a new page1, after clicking back to old page1, xhr content does loaded in the old page,  but the page2 still exist on the screen\n- data-force does reload the previous page but not including the xhr in it.\n- adding pageReinit to page1 does not solve the problem.\n\nAnd I tried the solution above in the topic, no luck.\n\nDo you have any idea? @nolimits4web \n I have got the same issue @hcw12889 and @noveweb\n\n``` javascript\n        page.view.router.back({\n            url: 'users/index',\n            force: true,\n            ignoreCache: true\n        });\n```\n\n... works ... however I don't know the `url:` up front.\n\nThis is the whole PageInit:\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.onPageInit('*', function (page) {\n  $$('form.ajax-submit').on('beforeSubmit', function (e) {\n    myApp.showIndicator();\n  });\n  $$('form.ajax-submit').on('submitError', function (e) {\n    myApp.alert('HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.');\n    myApp.hideIndicator();\n  });\n  $$('form.ajax-submit').on('submitted', function (e) {\n    $$(this).html(e.detail.data);\n    $$('form.ajax-submit .list-block').addClass('inputs-list');\n    if ($$('.flash.error.message').html()) {\n      myApp.alert($$('.flash.error.message').html());\n    } else {\n      if ($$('.flash.success.message').html()) {\n        myApp.addNotification({\n            title: 'MyApp',\n            message: $$('.flash.success.message').html()\n        });\n        page.view.router.back({\n            url: 'users/index',\n            force: true,\n            ignoreCache: true\n        });\n        // page.view.router.refreshPreviousPage();\n        // page.view.router.back({force: true, ignoreCache: true, pushState: true, reload: true});\n      }\n    }\n    $$('form.ajax-submit .flash.message').remove()\n    myApp.hideIndicator();\n  });\n});\n```\n @ionas @noveweb \n\nTo solve the dynamic previous url problem, I found the history entries can be read by\n\n```\npage.view.history\n```\n\nthen, we can do something like\n\n```\npage.view.router.back({\n  url: page.view.history[page.view.history.length - 2],\n  force: true,\n  ignoreCache: true\n});\n```\n\nBut I'm wondering why `page.view.router.refreshPreviousPage()` doesn't work in my code...\n @hcw12889 \r\nLook at the code in router.js line 838. The if part cause the problem you meet. I have commit it, but I have no idea about how to fix it. @obnijnil THANKS YOU MASTERRRRR!!!  Hi Vlad, @nolimits4web, can reload or refresh a piece of script on last back button.   Switching between tabs can we push the tab state in URL?\n Can we achieve this using some parameters in routers/ pushTabState etc?\n Do you think this is achievable?\n @murliatdure  @nolimits4web Is there a proper way to solve the problem?\n ?\n You might have to modify `router.js` and add a new hash to the URL/history every time a tab is switched.\n\nIf you want, you're welcome to create a plugin using the plugin API (https://framework7.io/docs/plugins-api.html) or create a PR (https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests). If you need help, F7 forums is always a good start: http://forum.framework7.io\n  I use domCache: ture, when I Back page,the page will reload?\nI want it don't reload,  can I have it?\n  I can use pushState in main-view pages,but in  other view pages, the pushState is invalid,what is wrong?tks~\n\nI have two view.\n\n``` js\nvar mianView = F7.addView('.mian-view', {\n    dynamicNavbar: false\n});\ncan use pushState\n```\n\n```\nvar ucenterView = F7.addView('.ucenter-view', {\n    dynamicNavbar: false\n});\ncan't use pushState\n```\n Oh I see\uff0cthanks\n  ```\nelm.off('click');\nelm.on('click', function(){//do...})\n\n```\n\nnot work\n  Using the kitchen-sink example I've created an example iOS Cordova App. All works fine, but when I try the form example and I focus an input field, the entire page scrolls up and the navbar disappears.

I propose the following to fully show the vertical scrollbar. The idea is basically to replace padding by margin and to change 100% height to `calc` height.\n\nI propose to replace all `padding-top: 44px;`, `padding-top: 88px;` and `padding-bottom: 44px;` on `content-block` with zero padding. Then I would add `margin-top` 44px and 88px respectively on the `content-block`. Finally I would change `height` of `content-block` from `100%` to something like `calc(100% - 86px)`.\n  sorry i find and read all of document, then try a lot of coding. i still stuck in this problem. i just want to know how to change active view when i have multiple view in my application.\nThank a lot!.\n views enabled are \"active\" maybe you have a z-index issue if some of your buttons or input are not accessible. \n WOW Thank! \n  I need to know how to switch between views.\n\n```\n.views\n  .view.view-main#view-1\n    // ..\n  .view#view-2\n  .view#view-2\n```\n\nSo from here, if I want to click on a link inside `#view-1` to switch to `#view-2` with page animation,\nhow can I achieve this?\n\nI am using `MeteorJS`.\n\n```\n  viewPageList = cleanJ.addView '#view-1',\n    dynamicNavbar: true\n\n  viewCropper = cleanJ.addView '#view-2',\n    dynamicNavbar: true\n```\n  Action/footer bar in cards are justified similar to toolbar; rather we should have the left|center|right segments where individual can compose the required controls at any place.\n\nCurrently all given controls gets justified.\n Can you please enable the Labels so that accordingly we can tag for the Enhancements, Suggestion etc.\n\nAnyways, Currently the component automatically supports the same; as JUSTIFIED behavior. I was looking for the navbar effect as (LEFT|CENTER|RIGHT) options inside the card footer.\n  https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/scrolling-techniques.html#scrolling-techniques-scrolling\n- Flexible space\n- Flexible space with image\n- Flexible space with overlapping content\n Agreed this is having the impact on the different devices/platforms.\n  Can we have multiple actions and corresponding callback i notifications.\n Confirmed, Its DONT's part. \nThanks\n  ![image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5etSi.gif)\n\nLooking for something like this \n1. Sliding Tabs\n2. More Tabs support - Android most of the apps shows this offcanvas tabs (rather justifies); on slide users can access the same .. nice approach for responsiveness.\n ![image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/82497b070232deae261241b28ca058173bfa4ba4/68747470733a2f2f6c68352e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f2d4e2d306152456e7444644d2f564576503449356b7872492f41414141414141417651412f33435248387048355671342f73313030362d6e6f2f736c6964696e672e676966)\n I added the SWIPER classes and initialization on the tab, It works as expected; but with this approach the tab highlight (bottom border) was not getting that swiping effect. Hence looking for tabs to have inbuilt feature of swiping.\n\nAnd there is another feature specially for the android devices; tabs more than the screen size gets the swiping feature; just like in the given GIF there are multiple tabs (more than 3-4); Top Grossing is out of the canvas; so after swiping on the tab links can switch to the tabs. Which is again a cool feature for the considering responsive and multiple sizes of devices. (~3-6inch devices in the market).\n\nJust a suggestion based on the usage of the F7 till time.\n  Searchbar integrated with the Navbar (incl back button)\n\n![image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rtRLq.png)\n\n![image](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3aUhWVUw3TFhUN1U/components_textfields_auto1.png)\n\n![image](http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1438927/whatsapp.png)\n\n![image](http://www.tuexpertoapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/whatsapp-material-design-android-02.jpg)\n\n![image](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3M1RJdzAwWE05cmc/components_textfields_auto4.png)\n\n![image](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3ZTFiMi1fRzZIcVU/components_textfields_auto6.png)\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-formatting\nhttps://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-auto-complete-text-field\n https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B6Okdz75tqQsa1RlU3Y2SDJWREE/patterns_navigational-transitions_sibling-to-sibling_tabs-02_xhdpi_003.webm\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/10714735/4d504246-7b22-11e5-860c-e587bf22610d.png)\n\nReference:\nhttp://materializecss.com/collapsible.html\n Similar effect is there with the Google APP \"INBOX\"; but its with the List view I guess.\nList of emails looks as listview and opening an item open the same as POPUP effect.\n  New Component - \n\n![image](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/css3-tutorials/breadcrumb-css3-text-effect-tutorials.jpg)\n\n![image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SD46Y.jpg)\n  https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/chips.html#chips-contact-chips\n\nhttp://materializecss.com/chips.html\n May be needed for the iOS too as TAGs components\n  ISSUE: Currently FAB is attached to the Page Fragment as fixed position; rather relative to the page/tab etc.\nI guess it should having exposures relative to the other components\n\nhttps://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B6Okdz75tqQsNVRkV3FZMktvMWc/components-buttons-fab-behavior_06_xhdpi_009.webm\n ENHANCEMENT: Multiple FABs - \n\nhttps://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B8v7jImPsDi-S01HZEpTMEdaUkk/components-buttons-fab-transition_trigger_02.webm\n ENHANCEMENT: FAB convertiable toolbar\n\nThe floating action button can transform into a toolbar upon press or from a toolbar upon scroll.

Its getting app close. I used pushState: true, swipePanel: 'left' params as well.\n  In v. 1.3.1 try to serialize and parse a deep nested object:\n\n``` js\nvar obj = {\n  'root0a/root0b': 'main/submain',\n  root1: {\n    prop1: {\n      prop1a: 'value1a',\n      prop1b: 'value1b'\n    },\n    prop2: 'value2'\n  },\n  root2: [\n    {\n      a: 1,\n      b: 2,\n      c: [\n        {\n          d: 3,\n          e: [ 'a', 'b' ]\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      f: 'c'\n    }\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nBoth the serialized string and the parsed object are wrong.\n Thanks Vladimir, but this solve only the serialization, not the parsing.\nTry this simple object:\n\n``` js\nvar obj = {\n  'root-a/root-b': 'main/submain',\n  root1: {\n    prop1: 'value1',\n    prop2: 'value2',\n    prop3: ['value3a', 'value3b']\n  }\n};\n```\n\nIf you serialize and then parse it, the result is:\n\n``` js\n{\n  root-a%2Froot-b: \"main%2Fsubmain\", \n  root1[prop1]: \"value1\", \n  root1[prop2]: \"value2\", \n  root1[prop3][]: \"value3b\"\n}\n```\n\nInto parseUrlQuery is missing <code>decodeURIComponent</code> for the key and the value, the object tree is not recreated and the <code>value3a</code> is lost.\n Sorry, but if you do not know a real-life example of such usage, why you added this enhancement in serialization? Why not in parsing? Your framework is very useful and complete and I'm simply surprised to see an incomplete solution :) If you want to open a local url (inside a Cordova app) passing a simple object using an url query, you propose a serialization method but not the corresponding parsing method to manipulate it into the destination page. I use JSON stringify/parse to solve this, but your serialization (the same used in PHP) is more compact and can be used only if there is a corresponding parsing method. Please note that I don't want to stress you, but only to make your framework always better! :)\n  I used the `index.html` from the getting started page and started to play around with options the framework offers. Until I ran into a really interesting issue. The framework tried to load the page `/t` on startup with the following javascript:\n\n``` js\nvar app = new Framework7({\n    pushState: true,\n    pushStateSeparator: '',\n})\n\nvar mainView = app.addView('.view-main', {\n    dynamicNavbar: true\n})\n```\n\nAfter some digging through the code I think I found the issue, on the following line https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/views.js#L553. It tries to split the document location with an empty push state, which returns the complete document location in a array and takes the second item. So for `http://localhost` that would be a `t` and proceeds to load that \"page\".\n\nNow I would be happy to create a pull request to fix it, except I'm not sure what the code is supposed to return and I don't have time to find out at the moment. I hope some else can fix this.\n\nPs. I think the code would also fail if the `pushStateSeparator` appeared twice in the `docLocation`, returning a partial url. I think you should join the array back together leaving only the first item.\n I'm currently using `window.location.origin + '/'`, so it would work in both production and development. But couldn't that be the default?\n Want me to create a pr? Am I correct in think this: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/f7-intro.js#L26, is the correct location for that?\n  If `app.params.pushState` and `app.params.pushStateSeparator` were enabled, an additional hashtag would be added to the url of the page, e.g., `data-page='main' ---> ##main`, when it should be `#main`.\n\nWhen moving back in the history, the contentCache would sometimes be cleaned even though the page was still present farther back in the history.\n @nolimits4web I've also added a check for `app.params.preventPushStateOnLoad` in the view onLoad.\n\nLet me know if you need anything.\n Sure; I'll set something up and link it to you here. I should be able to let you know by Tuesday.\n test for dist:\nhttp://robertblankenship.xyz/f7/?throwFailures=true&useRouterFixesBranch=false\n\ntest for PR branch:\nhttp://robertblankenship.xyz/f7/?throwFailures=true&useRouterFixesBranch=true\n\nThe tests are written with Jasmine.\n\nspec file:\nhttp://robertblankenship.xyz/f7/spec.js (compiled JavaScript) \nhttp://robertblankenship.xyz/f7/spec.coffee (CoffeeScript)\n If a page is opened using AJAX, then the url would be `myapp.com/#/about.html`. So there shouldn't really be any conflict.\n\nHere is an idea to handle the onload state:\n1) Check `history.state`\n2) Check for inline pages\n3) Check for pages templates\n4) Do AJAX as a last resort.\n\nThe benefit here is that 1-3 can be done quickly and synchronously.\n\nhttps://github.com/robert-blankenship/Framework7/commit/35da0584f05d54acff749fc97c5ed7f7a9f5f9f0\nI don't think we disagree about anything in this commit, should I make a separate PR for it?\n Sorry for the delay, I see that you've already added the commit. Thanks! I'll close this PR.\n  [kitchen-sink-ios]  & [kitchen-sink-material] \u3002\n I got it\uff0cthanks \u3002\n  I wish to use Angular + Framework7 together.

Weird.\n Thanks you\n  Hi,\nmy app has the main navigation done through a tab bar and in one specific tab I have added a Swiper slider but it doesn't work as expected. In fact if I try to swipe, the first slide return in his place...it seems like there's a sort of blocking anchor. Whereas if I put the slider inside a page-content div it works perfectly.\n Thank you, it works perfectly.\n I have a similar problem. I've put the swiper in a popup instead of a tab, got a similar problem that the first slide return in its place. Have the same symdrome as #505 that works if resize the browser.\n\nTest link: http://demo.medcomhk.net/f7-test/ (click question mark on upper right)\n\nAdded swiper.update(), still cannot solve the problem.\n Hi, I have the same problem as ausiuming. I have a multiple Swiper within a popup but when I open the popup the swiper is not working. After resizing the browser it works. Could you give a complete example to solve this problem? I can't find some infos about that in your docs. In addition there is no explanation for swiper.update(); \n\nUnfortunately I have the feeling it is a little bit complicated to work with popups.\n\nBy the way: if I have multiple Swiper in tabs the first is working with your update function but the second (with 3 swipes) is only showing the first 2 pics.\n Hi @nolimits4web , I have also encounter the same problem with the swiper slider. When i try to resizing the browser it works perfectly. Below are my code:\n\njioApp.swiper(\".swiper-1\", {\n            speed: 400,\n            spaceBetween: 10\n        });\n\nCan i know where to add this code \" swiper.update()\" to resolve this issue?\nThank you\n  Sorry for this,\nbut on a Cordova App, after the first displayed (and closed) notification, the second one throws an error in WebKit (wrong selector).\nThanks.\n Cordova 5.3.3, iPhone 5s with iOS 9.0.2. The simulator is not affected by this problem.\n I show the first notification on the main page, then I follow a link to another page and I open a new notification. The notification is opened as usual using myApp.addNotification and it is closed using the close button inside the notification itself.\n Yes: very strange! This is the error:\n\n```\n-[WebActionDisablingCALayerDelegate willBeRemoved]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x13f539860\n```\n\nThis is the plugins list:\n\n``` xml\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-whitelist\" spec=\"1.0.0\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-console\" spec=\"~1.0.1\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-splashscreen\" spec=\"~2.1.0\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-battery-status\" spec=\"~1.1.0\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-touchid\" spec=\"~0.3.0\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-camera\" spec=\"~1.2.0\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-ble-central\" spec=\"~1.0.1\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-device-motion\" spec=\"~1.1.1\" />\n    <plugin name=\"cordova-plugin-statusbar\" spec=\"~1.0.1\" />\n```\n\nTada! The bug in webkit appear when the onClose callback (the same used as onClick callback) contains the app.closeNotification.\n Removing the doble closeNotification call, I found the real problem: the transitionEnd handler (and also the animationEnd handler) is attached iterating the too large event array:\n\n``` js\nvar events = ['webkitTransitionEnd', 'transitionend', 'oTransitionEnd', 'MSTransitionEnd', 'msTransitionEnd'];\nvar events = ['webkitAnimationEnd', 'OAnimationEnd', 'MSAnimationEnd', 'animationend']\nfor (i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {\n  dom.on(events[i], fireCallBack);\n}\n```\n\nand the event handler is called more than one time. Enabling only one of the browser enabled events, there is not problem. I think is better to handle only one of the handler depending of the browser.\nDue this consideration, I will close this PR. Do you want I propose a solution for the animationEnd/transitionEnd issue?\n Is it time to close this now?  Hi, can Framework7 add a date range picker? The picker similar to the [Google Analytics](https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-a-date-picker-similar-to-the-one-in-Google-Analytics-Not-Good).\n\nThere a example in Kitchen Sink -> Calendar -> Multiple Values look close to this feature, but what I need is only two value, and auto highlight the date cells between min and max date after each pick;\n I second that! F7 really needs a date range picker\n You Rock!\n\nOn Sat, Nov 7, 2015 at 3:30 PM, Vladimir Kharlampidi <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Closed #643 https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/643 via\n> 4617de6\n> https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/4617de6544e1b15b2dd044868eae09dc0f1f076d\n> .\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/643#event-457981953.\n nice,thx\n  There are plenty popups saying \"Hacked\".... etc\n\nhttps://f7-chat.firebaseapp.com/\n\nThanks\n  When a panel (with cover or reveal effect) is with a dark theme, the status bar overlay must be moved with the panel (or the view) to avoid an ugly effect: the panel has the top area with the same color of the status bar.\n Below the answer:\n- Fig.1: kitchen sink with default css\n- Fig.2: kitchen sink with default css and fixed statusbar color\n- Fig.3: kitchen sink with this PR\n\n![fig 1 - kitchen sink with default css](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1668543/10316076/00fa40ae-6c5e-11e5-9cb4-d83d685ea966.png)\n\n![fig 2 - kitchen sink with default css and fixed statusbar color](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1668543/10316192/60f384ac-6c5e-11e5-9fa2-679a545a0870.png)\n\n![fig 3 - kitchen sink with pr](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1668543/10316092/0ed4cad2-6c5e-11e5-87da-ee59408c3238.png)\n Certainly the look and fell of the app is subjective and of course I full respect your point of view. Every designer/developer can easily customize her css app and it is not a big deal. I've proposed this PR because there is also an idea behind it. Typically when you open a side panel you need a menu item or a short view of some data (list of friends, etc.): this is not a continuous work status and the informations of the statusbar probably are irrelevant at moment. Probably is nice to see a more clear view without the statusbar (using the cordova plugin). In this case the full colored statusbar overlay is ugly.\nFacebook is not an idol and its app is not the best app in the world! :-)\nTry to see Jawbone UP (https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/up-by-jawbone/id916240764?mt=8&uo=4) and you can see a look and feel like Fig3.\n I think that an additional css class is a simple solution :D\n   am trying to make an api call in my hybrid app using framework7 Dom7 Its working very fine when i am testing on browser,but when i build online on phonegap for android's APK on my phone.Rest all JS working fone on phonebut only ajax call is not getting fired.\n\nvar myApp = new Framework7();\nvar $$ = Dom7;\n\n$$('form.ajax-submit').on('submitted', function (e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\nmyApp.showPreloader();\n    var searchKey=$$(\"#search-key\").val();\n              $$(\"#track\").text('API calling');\n    $$.get(\"http://my/api/path/dev/apiv-1-0-2/students/\"+searchKey,function(response){\n             $$(\"#track\").text('got the response');\n});\n});\n\nI had applied the track of my js progress code ,i get the response \"API CALLING\" but not the \"GOT THE RESPONSE\" message.\n no,no error but yes i put my div text changing code on different part like $$(\"#track\").text('API calling');\nits changing ie code running fine before ajax call code but text not changing when make an ajax call.i believe this means there is some issue with the ajax call.\n instead of :\n\n``` javascript\n$$.get(\"http://my/api/path/dev/apiv-1-0-2/students/\"+searchKey,function(response){\n    $$(\"#track\").text('got the response');\n});\n```\n\nuse:\n\n``` javascript\n$$.ajax({\n    url: \"http://my/api/path/dev/apiv-1-0-2/students/\"+searchKey,\n    success: function(response){\n        alert('got the response');\n    },\n    error: function(){\n        alert('got an error');\n    }\n});\n```\n\nand see what you get\n  if (app.params.onPageReinit) app.params.onPageBeforeInit(app, pageData);\n\nshould be\n\nif (app.params.onPageReinit) app.params.onPageReinit(app, pageData);\n  error on startup becouse of bad link..\n  Hi,\n\nHairlines like the top \"border\" of a card-footer aren't displayed on my device. It's a LG G3 with android 5.1.\n\nThe body classes are `pixel-ratio-3 retina android android-5 android-5-1-1`.\nI fixed the issue by adding this:\n\n``` less\nhtml {\n  &.android, &.pixel-ratio-3 {\n    .card-footer:before {\n      transform: scaleY(0.5);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI could have also applied a height: 2px; to .card-footer itself instead.\n\nOf course I don't know what I am doing and this might break something else.\n BTW, I am using cordova, if that helps (or bothers).\n Does the LG G3 have true `pixel-ratio-3`?\n\nI assume not. Try to override the class and make it `pixel-ratio-2`\n Yes I do: `pixel-ratio-3 retina android android-5 android-5-1-1`\n According to this table it should be 3 http://www.canbike.org/CSSpixels/, but the screen is Quad HD, does that mean that pixel ratio should be 4?\n Sure, I can do that, but I wonder what will happen with other devices.\n I guess this can be closed, but are you going to include something on Framework7 so the workaround isn't needed?\n\nThanks.\n  We listen onPageBeforeInit (tried onPageInit as well, didn't help). The listener calls our init script. This script checks authorization and if the current user is not authed then calls mainView.router.loadPage('login.html'). The login page has a button to get back which loads previouse page (with auth checking). It again checks authorization, gets on line with loadPage(\u2026) and nothing happens, it just goes throught it and \u2018login.html\u2019 is not opened. So loadPage doesn't work on the second attempt.\nWe have played with this bug and found out that it works if loadPage(\u2026) is inside of setTimeout with 400ms delay (less doesn't work).\nSo it looks like framework7 does something inside, like initialization or kind of and it take ~400ms and it blocks loadPage(..) method.\n I have had this issue before. Its not broken, just doesn't work as expected. A page is initiated once if its still in the history, doesn't initiate twice.\n @MarcGodard how did you handle it? i mean it's not good at all to call loadPage(..) from setTimeout kind of setTimeout(function(){ mainView.router.loadPage('...');}, 400); \n Figured it out. You are right, it's not a bug but very expected behaviour. F7 router sets **allowPageChange** to false when processing its internal businesses. It blocks **loadPage** execution. It's possible to manualy set this var before **loadPage** but it breaks everything up.\n\n**allowPageChange** is changed back when animation is completed (and i suppose somewhere else if animation is disabled). So animation takes ~300ms and it's the answer why 400ms timeout delay has worked out. \n\nSo, it can be handled if listen **onPageAfterAnimation** instead of **onPageInit** \u2014 our code runs after **allowPageChange** changed back. \n\nBut **onPageAfterAnimation** doesn't work out if a page has no animation. E.g. the first page works without animation and **onPageAfterAnimation** is not triggered. \n\nSo for correct handling this crazy stuff you need to listen both **onPageAfterAnimation** and **onPageInit** and make some logic to handle it\n Is there any other way other than preroute to handle this ? I am stuck at this point and it is not working at ll.\n  Your Pull To Refresh component is awesome!

(maybe by starting list from the target index, and after initial page render, `prependItems(items)` to the list?)\nany help would be highly appreciated\n    Any plans for the material ui more components and transitions effects, as library is stable and almost there for next phase of effect -\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20823671/google-profile-like-scrolling-effect\n +1\n can be an awesome addition to an awesome framework :)\n https://github.com/saulmm/Android-Material-Examples\n\n![image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c3e790f0f32002d54ac498927ca1aeb36ebc7d9b/68747470733a2f2f6c68342e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f2d646d44466f4637633555592f564437374e73464b386b492f4141414141414141754c4d2f4d74537150384a6f51636f2f773238322d683439392d6e6f2f323031342d31302d313625324230305f35315f33342e676966)\n\n![image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/82a4ee22be3278ebef4241ebbd8eb9443c3f003d/68747470733a2f2f6c68362e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f2d65636f5751656a4c6d46452f5645426f526f3351735f492f41414141414141417554552f595a37383535476d4f66772f773237362d683439382d6e6f2f6170706561722e676966)\n\n![image](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/82497b070232deae261241b28ca058173bfa4ba4/68747470733a2f2f6c68352e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f2d4e2d306152456e7444644d2f564576503449356b7872492f41414141414141417651412f33435248387048355671342f73313030362d6e6f2f736c6964696e672e676966)\n http://codepen.io/suez/full/emjwvP/ - some references\n Has this come to anything or can it be closed?

I'm running it off Cordova, however I was able to gain same behavior in safari (all on OS X 8): \n1. Open http://guillaumebiton.github.io/HackerNews7/ nice test application\n2. Pull the whole thing to refresh, release so that preloader is shown \n3. While the preloader is spinning, pull aga with a long gesture (almost to the bottom of the screen) and wait till preload finishes.\n4. Once preloader finished spinning, `.pull-to-refresh-layer` is visible, and the whole view is stuck somewhere mid-screen with `translate` applied to it. \n\nPlease see illustrative video for details https://www.dropbox.com/s/wm2o3d3lo1mxd3j/issue_with_ptr_2.mov?dl=0\n\nCheers,\nAlex. \n  Hey guys,\nis it possible, that there is no \"color-white\" for \"icon-form-password\" and \"icon-form-name\" is available?

None of the buttons will work.\nExcept the open sidebar icon top right.\n\nUsually it takes 3 swipe back to freeze navigation, whatever the amount of pages you visited (create dynamic page .)\n\nps: i think that the behavior works like this if you swipe fast. If you swipe slower it might not freeze.\n iPhone 6, IOS 8.4 (not 8.4.1)\n\ni can replicate it every single time\njust swipe fast back, like you would with any app.\n\nas homescreen app as well as in Safari\n\nI will test it on an older iphone with outdate ios too and let you know\n\nthese are my setting in the my-app.js:\n\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    pushState: true,\n    cache: false,\n    swipeBackPageAnimateOpacity: false,\n    swipeBackPageAnimateShadow: false,\n    swipeBackPageActiveArea: 100,\n    // swipeBackPageThreshold: 100,\n    swipeBackPage: true\n    // swipePanel: 'left'\n});\n\ntried everything related to swiping. \nAnd AnmateOpacity, does not seem to work, the 'previous' page still show darken (i guess less opacity) while swiping.\n\nWhen it freezes, if on home page, i can click Services, it shows the click animation (focus), but nothing happens. Initially i thought there is some sort of overlay that does not disappear, but there is clicktrough so i have no idea, it's hard to debug it on the phone with Safari dev tools.\nOn desktop, i can not simulate the dragging fast, to see if it happens too.\n I mirrored the device on my screen:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6MtqClJH_q-ZFJ6ZjM5YXBHTVE/view?usp=sharing\n\nYou see how i can scroll 5 levels deep, and then when swipe back, at some point it just stays stuck.\nThere is no way to record the tap, but before i tap the sidebar, i try all links on that page, and nothing happens.\n\nallowPageChange: true does also not do anything.\n Then there could be issue with layout or with data, do you see any errors in console?\n The layout is the standard one that comes with the distribution.\nTo be honest i did not try  to use this because of this issue, so i dod not continue to look into it.\n\nThere are also no errors in the console. (Was the first thing i tried/looked into)\n\nI have no clue what can trigger it. \n  ![screenshot 2015-08-19 6 43 30](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/63774/9360486/083bb880-46c9-11e5-8a39-e7f7e4596fb7.png)\nBefore 1.2 is OK, but I upgrade to 1.2 the VList item sep line gone.\n Real device\n  We have observed in testing that swipeouts on Chrome are sometimes causing a strange animation glitch. It's fine in Safari, but oddly enough Chrome glitches out in some instances but not all. This can be observed in the kitchen sink example; see the video here for a recording of the issue: https://vid.me/0FWg \n\nIt's quite hard to debug; slowing the animations down in devtools doesn't allow the issue to be reproduced, so I'm not sure quite which part of the CSS is causing the problem. \n On mobile, for the lists with Swipe-options gets hide, If I click again that displays; seems to be a rendering issue only with the swipe-options list/media list.\n It is already fixed in dev version\n mostly the list gets blank and once tap it rerenders. It happens frequently with the Tabs and Swipeout panels. Can you please share a quick fix.. \n  We\u00b4ve been using the slider styles in a web app and made it work for IE and Firefox.\n\nPlease review and merge if you like the changes. Most other styles seem to work in Firefox and IE though :).\n  I faced an issue with flickering interface after back animation.\nHere is the sample video:\nhttps://youtu.be/jY5e30yZxzY?t=25\n\nIt only happens with \"no-tabbar\" option.\nI would appreciate any suggestions.\n\nP.S.: video recorded on iPhone 5s (cordova+Framework7 app)\n I didn't made any changes to CSS.\nI found this issue in my app and then I made a new app from \"clean\" tab-bar example. I just add class to change navbar colour.\n\nThe problem occur only if \"no-tabbar\" option is enabled.\nIt's not visible in desktop browser, only on real device in PhoneGap app (http://app.phonegap.com/) or in compiled iOS app.\n Here is Phonegap project that I used in video for testing:\nhttps://yadi.sk/d/loUgGpXLihLqK\n This is the same issue I reported before. However the thread was changed into a shadow issue. \n\nI added a bunch of information on the cause to that other thread. I assume you are using Cordova and phone gap and even safari I have seen this. \n\nIf I was at my computer I would link or copy the info I had found. \n\nIt has to do with the height of the window not being 100% and the over scroll being added and removed by the web UI or by safari. Whenever the overflow scroll is added or removed there is a flash. \n\nThe only solution I can think of trying (been busy and haven't tried it yet) is to have the page content be 100% plus 1 pixel so the over scroll stays on the page. \n Thanks for the solution!\nI really appreciate your feedback.\n\nBy the way I already find some workaround:\n\n```\nmyApp.onPageBeforeAnimation('player', function(page) {\n    $(\".toolbar.tabbar\").hide();\n});\n\nmyApp.onPageBack('player', function(page) {\n    $(\".toolbar.tabbar\").show();\n});\n```\n\nBut CSS way it's definately better :)\n  Hi!\n\nWhen you open a little the panel (swipe) and close that. The events close/closed on the panel no triggered.\n\nMy code:\n`$$(document).on('open', '.panel-left', function () {\n        console.log('open');\n    });\n    $$(document).on('close', '.panel-left', function () {\n        console.log('close');\n    });\n    $$(document).on('opened', '.panel-left', function () {\n        console.log('opened');\n    });\n    $$(document).on('closed', '.panel-left', function () {\n        console.log('closed');\n    });\n`\n\nWithout open\n![without open](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1323180/9314826/cccc037c-4501-11e5-8f30-bed2bd7dc041.png)\n\nLittle open\n![little open](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1323180/9314827/cccf58ec-4501-11e5-8102-b6cee7851055.png)\n\nAnd closed\n![and close](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1323180/9314828/ccd190f8-4501-11e5-942a-f71e94d87483.png)\n\nOpen panel, triggered the events\n![open panel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1323180/9314829/ccd4eb7c-4501-11e5-9399-983c9ed1bed2.png)\n\nThis lines, call to open/close panel and trigger the event, but the panel is \".active\" or not, and the functions not continue.\n![lines](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1323180/9314962/9e981166-4502-11e5-8829-0fc73e45b807.png)\n\nSorry for my english.\n  Terminating pull-to-refresh when there is on-screen keyboard present and touch is moved to the keyboard.\n\nThe behavior is still somewhat non-ideal, however no weird artifacts are present. Now it works like this: \n1. Pull-to-refresh initiated on panel \n2. Drag finger to keyboard\n3. Safari iOS  8 continues to send `touchmove` events when on keyboard, but no `touchend`! When we detect that `touchmove` coords are lower than `window.innerHeight`, we throw in touchend equavalent event, which terminates ptr exactly as if one did it with their finger. \n hi @nolimits4web, reverted the changes; the pull request is updated accordingly (but it has got 3 commits now). \n\nFor the issue, really I have seen it with Cordova/safari web view on iOS, when the overscroll (bounce effect) is disabled. Not sure about the rest. \n\nJust checked the http://guillaumebiton.github.io/HackerNews7/ app on an iPhone in different apps, results: \n1. Safari (browser, not web view component). All works well! When you have keyboard on screen, and drag the pull-to-refresh action with the finger finishing touch on top of keyboard, the `touchEnd` event is thrown in, PTR works as expected. \n2. Cordova app (what we use as a container, just pointed it at the Guillaime's app URL: issues. PTR gots stuck if dragging over the keyboard. \n3. There is another app I have on iPhone, called QRReader. Upon reading QR code with URL, it first opens up page in web view, and then there are buttons to open it in safari ios/chrome/etc. So, this app seems to use webview components just as cordova does-  and the issue happens too. \n\nSo I would say, this seems to be an issue of the web view component not throwing the event to JS when touch end over keyboard. Moreover, the fix proposed would only work if the webview **is resized** to the keyboard appearance, which is **not** default behavior on Cordova - I should better add recipe to the issue description in case someone faces the same I guess...\n Just checked that now, unfortunately no good result. `touchcancel` is not thrown in either, neither are other 'relevant' events like mouseup touchend etc. For some weird reason it continues to throw in 'touchmove' event. \n\nI've also looked into `setCapture` (outdated) and `requestPointerLock` (desktop version only ,for the newer APIs like dragging out of a window) methods, but no luck. \n Did you manage to take a look?  ![screen shot 2015-08-17 at 17 46 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5450382/9309155/1dc8735e-4508-11e5-9c9e-f0a6d78e567f.png)\n\nIt seems as if the :after style used for the border between list items causes Firefox to incorrectly justify the content in .item-inner. If the :after style is switched off, .item-after text is aligned properly. I'm not sure what the best solution would be. \n Ah I see, yes, do you know the issue for that bug? I can't find it with the search. \n\nThanks for the suggestion, but I'm afraid it causes a few other problems; it may help for some though, since it depends on the markup. \n  Hi All! \n\nThanks for the great framework; it seems to rocket web development for devices, especially fro hybrid apps. \n\nSo the issue for me is as follows: \n1. On iOS 8 (also checked with iOS7, same resutls), we have a pull-to-refresh panel with the input (textbox) on it. \n2. When that input is focused, the on-screen keyboard is shown. \n3. After that, while the keyboard is shown, if I pull the panel down, it just gets stuck (no 'release' really happens), the arrow stays visible. \n   1. However, there's certain threshold to make this happen. \n\nI have actually wrapped in the simplest possible cordova container one of the demo apps - Hackers news - which features this issue, to see how it behaves. And here is screen recording from it: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18312907/framework7_issue_webview_scroll.mov\n\nWould appreciate any help regarding the issue!\n\nCheers,\nAlex. \n Done some additional research. \n\nThis is a well-known behavior in the desktop world - basically what happens is that Pull-to-refresh relies on 3 events to operate - touchStart, touchMove and touchEnd. \n\nIn our case, when the keyboard is shown, and user drags an ample distance, the touchEnd event is not received (since touchEnd happens on the keyboard, and not our web view). \n\nAny ideas how we could fix this? I was thinking of 2 approaches: \n1. Ugly: add a timer, if PTR initiated, collapse it in .5 seconds. Should be really annoying to end users. \n2. Better: somehow detect the webview has lost touch, and either throw in touchEnd or handle it separately. \n\nThanks! \n  Hi everyone!\nI need something like accordion menu with checkboxes. It means I can set checkbox and/or open accordion menu and check/uncheck some elements inside.\nAnybody can help me?\n I've done just that and there is a problem with the CSS selector. Here is a checkbox+accordion that contain a checkbox.\n\n```\n<label class=\"label-checkbox item-content\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\">\n    <div class=\"item-media\">\n        <i class=\"icon icon-form-checkbox\"></i>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"item-inner\">\n        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"item-content item-link\">\n                <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                    <div class=\"item-title\">Item 1</div>\n                </div>\n            </a>\n            <div class=\"accordion-item-content\">\n                <div class=\"list-block\">\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            <label class=\"label-checkbox item-content\">\n                                <input type=\"checkbox\">\n                                <div class=\"item-media\">\n                                    <i class=\"icon icon-form-checkbox\"></i>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                                    <div class=\"item-title\">Sub item 1</div>\n                                </div>\n                            </label>\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</label>\n```\n\nThe problem is that if I check the outer checkbox, the inner checkbox appear checked. The real value of the hidden checkbox html input is correct, it is only a problem with selector.\n\nFor `.icon-form-checkbox` the selector `label.label-checkbox input[type=checkbox]:checked+.item-media i.icon-form-checkbox` is used in a good way and don't cause problem.\nBut the other selector `label.label-checkbox input[type=checkbox]:checked~.item-inner i.icon-form-checkbox` is too broad and influence the inner selector as well.\nA simple fix I found is to add `>` like so `label.label-checkbox input[type=checkbox]:checked~.item-inner>i.icon-form-checkbox`.\n\nI don't know how to do pull request, but it would be nice to fix this for everyone. Except, of course, if I made a mistake and then I apologize in advance.\n\nEDIT: if it is indeed a real fix, I would love to do a pull request if someone explain to me how to do it properly. I know basic git command like commit and push. It would be a blast to help an open source project.\n Sorry for the confusion, I don't want to use checkbox as open/close indicator.  \nI want an independent checkbox and accordion. I can check/uncheck or open/close the accordion, but I want them visually in the same space (without rewriting a lot of CSS).\nI understand that this is a bit unconventional, but it work. I will take into account that `label>label>input` is semantically incorrect (very good point) but since this is an hybrid app, it should not be a big problem for now.\nI will have to rewrite a lot of CSS in the end, but for now I want a working prototype.\nThank you for your help and comment.\n The only problem I was facing was that the \"checked\" attribute was not changed in the sub checkboxes, but their aspect was, and I needed the attribute to changed. I implemented the good behavior with js, and then, the css was not a problem. I also added a change when some sub checkbox are selected.\n![untitled-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3472596/10720551/e7636dba-7b98-11e5-8538-f03d1b5a8e1c.png)\nI'm clearly working outside of the standard use, so it is not a problem with the framework really. It work as indented and I shouldn't have bothered you with that in the first place, thank you for your help and time.\n  Actually, the back-button and the text \"Back\" is not as a whole aligned to center - the look can be better, if back-button and \"Back\"-Text are really aligned to middle. You can try it yourself: \nset \"padding-top: 2px;\" of \".navbar a.link span\" inf F7.css to the \"Back\"-Text-Element and it looks a bit better as now.\n  Actually in f7 this css-property\n\n .buttons-row .button{\n    width: 100%;\n}\n\nleads in safari to cutted buttons (when using button-row).\n\nChanging this to \n\n  .buttons-row .button{\n    width: auto;\n}\n\nsolves the problem. Other browsers will not be affected by the change.\n  f7 has set background:#fff in .pages css-class. Should be set to transparent. In Safari browser this leads to strange black line at the right side..\n\nAnd the navbar has a white line at the right side on safari browser. You can see it if you change the color to black on .navbar-class. For this, I cannot find the reason in f7-css..\n For the second case, I found the reason. When I route from index to about then on the left side of the about-page the strange white line comes from the underlined index-page which is covered by about-page due to its page property:\n-webkit-transform: translate3d(-165px, 0, 0);\nopacity: 0.9138686131386862;\n\nHowever, when decreasing the number of 165px the white line (which is the index-page), then index-page will be covered full by about-page.\n\nActually, in Safari when I route from p1 to p2, then p1 is not fully hidden (thus, the strange lines at the left side).. \n Forget it. The reason was because of a slide which was not complete and views the background-layer-view.\n  Navbar and Toolbar uses css-position \"absolute\", navbar fixed to top, toolbar fixed to bottom. \n\nI guess, it would be really better to make the layout of navbar (header), \"pages\" and \"toolbar\" (footer) by using \"flexbox-column-layout\" where pages height is set to 100%. \n\nWith such a layout, it would be really easy to adapt the height of navbar and toolbar to any size afterwards without breaking the other layout-content. \n\nAs f7 uses different \"layout types\", flexbox-column-layout could also be adapt to these layout-styles. Using strict flexbox for layout-types enhances the flexibility to adapt styling changes and so on..\n Okay, thanks for the information!\n  Although we can put the structure as PAGE inside popup will work.\nI am looking for something where the same contents should work as POPUP and PAGE as well via API support.\n Aweosme .. Thanks\n Can we have the F7 solution - where we can use .. \n- Template7\n- Inline Pages\n\netc..\n Hey, Thanks, Tried the following snapcode and achieved what I was looking for - \n\n$.get('fragments/case-info.html', function(data) {  \n            var compiled = Template7.compile(data)\n            application.popup('<div class=\"popup tablet-fullscreen\">' + compiled(context) + '</div>');\n        });\n  when options.cache is false and data not empty then will bug if paramsPrefix will not changed\n  Adding dynamic options in Smart selct is very time consuming and on average devices it hangs to infinite.\n\nAny alternative to handle the the and adding options to DOM optimally?\n  Changed css links\n Reverted! Will you create new release to fix the mistake on download?\n\nThanks, Vlad!\n  I noticed that using material icons via Google Web Fonts with badges does not work.\nI mean linking Google Web Fonts for material icons:\n\n``` html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\">\n```\n\nand using them as indicated in Google's documentation (see https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web):\n\n``` html\n<i class=\"material-icons\">face</i>\n```\n\nWhich in the case of Framework7 I guess it should look like something such as:\n\n``` html\n<i class=\"icon material-icons\">face<span class=\"badges bd-red\">5</span></i>\n```\n\n(notice the `icon` and `material-icons` classes)\nUsing it this way will just not show the \"5\" text (the badge will appear \"empty\").\n\nThe problem is with the `font-family` the Google Web Fonts for material icons sets.\n\nTo fix it I included a piece of style for my app such as the following:\n\n``` css\n.material-icons .badge {\n    font-family: Roboto, Noto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n    -webkit-font-smoothing: initial;\n}\n```\n\nto get the same look and feel as with the icons included in Framework7.\n\nI didn't want to send a pull request to discuss with you the best approach to solve the issue, just in case you may find a better one :)\n  Don't need add paramPrefix in url if stringData is empty\n  The code\n\n``` javascript\ninput.attr('multiple')\n```\n\nreturns an empty string (which will be interpreted as false) in this case\n\n``` html\n<select multiple></select>\n```\n  Hello, I like the android-theme. Really good work! \n\nHowever, According to http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/app-layout.html#.VcHRpLfYBE4, html-layout is different for android and ios. \n\nIt would be nice, if html-layout for both can be the same, so only css-files is to change. \n\nHtml-Layout should not be affected by css. Imagine, developing for both platforms, actually I need to have different html-files. \n This is not possible without some serious re-writing (I have looked into it).\n\nHowever, using any sort of MVC model should fix this. I use the templates7 and the only thing I change is the index file to go back and forth between ios and android. Works well for what it is.\n  When you have a media list inside two tabs, the tab thats hidden (despite still being display:none by default), every single image in the hidden tab will be loaded, not even just the ones in viewport.\n I have two tabs, both with a media list, the media list img's have class=\"lazy\" on them, the lazy loading works fine for the defaulted open tab, but the hidden tab, it will load _all_ the images even though the tab is hidden and not in viewport.\n If F7 could have a :hidden selector like jquery, this would be easily fixable with something pseudo like:\n\n`if ($e.is(\":hidden\")) return;`\n\nWould detect if any of ancestor elements are hidden.\n  I know windows phone is not supported, but anyway I tried :)\nthe virtual listview on windows phone 10, but it doesn't load the items at the end of the screen.\nAny idea what I can do to get it work ?\n I did some test and come so far, that this is not a problem of Framework7. Virtual Listview works on windows phone, when used in a cordova universal app. When used in a cordova windows phone 8 app they don't work, and other things like swipe to delete don't work either in wp8 because the webview eats up some of swipe events and handles them itself. I am searching now for a solution for this.\n  When you have a list of links and you do multi touch, one of the links becomes active, the 2nd touch eliminates the removal of the active state, leaving the active class and link shaded. \n\nIs there an easy way to eliminate this problem? Maybe detect 2nd touch and remove all active states?\n @nolimits4web IS this possible? Do you have anything to detect multi-touch?\n  Hi,\nI refer searchbar & hide bars on scroll example at http://www.idangero.us/framework7 to implement my website.\nWhen i scroll, navbar hide but search bar doesn't move to top. So layout look bad at that time.\n\nI also refer DOM7 library but i don't find any event which fires when navbar hidden.\nAny idea for moving searchbar to top when navbar hidden ?\n Thank for your reply, it helped me to resolve my problem \n  Is it possible to use your picker code to add space and scroll for when a cordova keyboard is used and opened?\n\nPerhaps this:\n\n``` JavaScript\nvar keyboardPicker = myApp.picker({\n  input: '.keyboard-picker',\n  visible: 'false',\n  height: 255\n});\n```\n\nThis way the page will scroll and position itself nicely for when cordova and a keyboard is used.\n\nAlso, if visible is false, you should be able to type in the input fields.\n\nWhat do you think?\n  Can we have Page Slider something like this - \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7137859/9026752/3575514e-3959-11e5-8845-12a7e1ad45bf.png)\n\nI.e.

And what is wrong with Infinite Scroll?\n @nolimits4web @valnub @ZanderBrown \r\nCan be closed.  @ZanderBrown \r\nBecause there is no pull up to refresh feature. Noone needs that. If he specially needs that he can develop a plugin.   fix setting/getting element's data- attributes\nadd more control over shortcut events like in 'on' method\n :+1: \n I can agree with extending event shortucts. But not sure about `.data`. First of all i don't think it needs to be mixed with `data-` attributes. There are special methods for that. And data is not always a string we can need to be set anything: array, object, func, .etc. It is not possible to store it in attributes. And i don't really understand this:\n\n```\nthis[0].dom7ElementDataStorage -> this[0][dom7ElementDataStorage]\n```\n\nIt will not help to save a lot in compression (just few bites :)), but it such access to properties can cause a big loose in performance as direct access using `.` is much faster\n I'm fully agree with you. It's my mistake )\n I have fixed my mistake with data-methods. Now only event shortcuts update in file)\n And what about deleting attribute in 'removeData' method ?\n\nremoveData: function(key) {\n        for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {\n            var el = this[i];\n            if (el.dom7ElementDataStorage && el.dom7ElementDataStorage[key]) {\n                el.dom7ElementDataStorage[key] = null;\n                delete el.dom7ElementDataStorage[key];\n            }\n            if (el.getAttribute('data-' + key)) {\n                el.removeAttribute('data-' + key);\n           }\n        }\n    },\n  Picker is very wonderful! But it scroll very slow on android devices, even Sumsung galaxy S5.\nAnd I found these code cause the problem in updateItems function:\n\n```\n          col.wrapper.find('.picker-selected, .picker-after-selected, .picker-before-selected').removeClass('picker-selected picker-after-selected picker-before-selected');\n\n          col.items.transition(transition);\n          var selectedItem = col.items.eq(activeIndex).addClass('picker-selected').transform('');\n          var prevItems = selectedItem.prevAll().addClass('picker-before-selected');\n          var nextItems = selectedItem.nextAll().addClass('picker-after-selected');\n```\n\nI removed some of unused code, and it solved the problem(only when rotateEffect is false).\n When there is many items in on col, those code will cause scroll very slow on most android devices.\n Thanks, i will check it. But these lines:\n\n``` js\nvar prevItems = selectedItem.prevAll().addClass('picker-before-selected');      \nvar nextItems = selectedItem.nextAll().addClass('picker-after-selected');\n```\n\ncan't be deleted. You just cropped functionality \n I find these two classname is not used in css file, and it cause scroll to be very slow on most android devices. And I think you can use other css selectors, such as `.picker-selected ~ .picker-item`, instead of manipulate all items' classname.\n If rotateEffect is set true,  android device nearly can't scroll the picker. Because you will change all item's transform attr when scroll move.\n  Hi there,\n\nI noticed the status bar (`.statusbar-overlay` div) is hidden on any iPhone 6 Plus. Its `display` property is set to `none` ; the body has no `padding-top` and, obviously, the `views` div has an incorrect height (bigger than expected). \nHowever, using an iPhone 6, everything is fine. My code is the same on both devices.\n\nDid I miss any configuration?\nI have seen [this current issue](#531), but I do not think they are related.\n Can't see such issue, for example in default demo app:\n![statusbar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/999588/8763293/a3c54108-2d9d-11e5-9024-d5fcbee0a6e1.png)\n If you use Cordova, make sure that you have correct settings about Status bar\n Hi Vladimir,\n\nI am not using Cordova but wrapping my HTML & JS app into a UIWebView.\n\nI have just noticed the html root tag does not have the `with-statusbar-overlay` class. Any idea why?\n It is not a cordova, just an webapp pinned to home screen. Anyway, you can always force to enable it by setting `statusbarOverlay:true` app parameter\n I did use that parameter. It had no effect.\nI tested the rendering on both emulator and real device.\n\nHere is a screenshot of what I have so far. You can see the overlapping right corner background. Also, I noticed strange paddings/gutters on both vertical sides.\n\n![screen shot 2015-07-20 at 13 48 10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6152745/8786964/23857a68-2ee6-11e5-822a-14cb9101e60e.png)\n It is not really possible for this parameter to have no effect as it forces to make visible `statusbar-overlay`. Otherwise there is something wrong or conflict in your HTML layout\n  Hi Vlad, I found a bug in the photo browser in Android. when clicking twice and zooming in, I can't click twice to zoom out, it is stuck on the zoomed picture....\n\nthanks for your time,\n\nshaul.\n Hi, will check it, thanks\n And what is Android' and browser' version? As i can't replicate this issue\n hi vlad, i used android lollipop...\ni also exported to crosswalk 14 if it helps...\n\ni checked and saw that it is supposed to work, i dont know why it didnt work for me, maybe its connected to crosswalk?\n OK, I checked again and it still doesn't work even when I check the kitchen sink online demo as well. I am working with latest Chrome on Android 5 lollipop.\n Still work for me. Try on another device. It could be device-related issue\n  fix for Chrome and IE\n Yes, it will fix it in Chrome, but there is problem with it because if you put inside anything except it will not behave like it should, and `display:flex` has many advantages on `display:block` especially for something else instead of text, for example buttons\n OK so I have try and there could be a fix with flex. Need to apply display: flex on .navbar and in .navbar.center remove display lines that enables flex. And it works too\n Hi, do you want me to close this PR ?\n  thx for you answer,but I write a simple demo by myself,the scroll is smooth; Is it proves the reason what makes scroll be not smooth isn't slowly Android?\nThe official f7 Plus said they can fixes some compatibility issuein include scroll in Android 4.0+ .\n The answer is the same, it is because Android < 4.4 is just slow. And it is not just a content with a plain text. There are, for example, list views which heavily use flexbox, and many 3D-transformed elements. I guess it causes low performance on old/slow Androids\n With what instead of flexbox and 3D-transform  could improve performance?\n @ada90 : I read about the non-smooth scroll time-to-time, but I can't replicate it with my HTC One X that's run a factory Android 4.2.3 + Chrome and Firefox. What is your setup? Could you demo the slowness?\n  Adding the div with class with-statusbar-overlay does not work in iOS 9.\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/status-bar.html\n\n![img_0919](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/174578/8510212/281f6036-22a5-11e5-872d-ebeeb886f073.PNG)\n I think it is too early to talk about iOS9 as it is still in early better. But i guess it is iOS bug. There is no specific about it in F7\n I just wanted to make you aware. Like you said, it is perhaps too early but I don't think it is a bug. I have other standalone work that does not behave the same way. If you save this link http://www.demos.ultimatezencart.com/0701M/ to the home screen, you'll see that it isn't affected. I do have other work with jQuery Mobile that it is affected so, like you say, it is too early.\n\nThanks by the way for such an awesome framework. I have worked with several mobile and responsive frameworks and framework7 is by far the best I've seen.\n iOS 9 beta 4 still exhibits this issue. I haven't looked into it yet at all to offer a solution.\n Beta 5 also is still broken.\n\nIssue in the Apple developer forums: https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/30098#30098\n Still broken in iOS 9 GM Seed.\n\nAlso still broken in the first iOS 9.1 beta.\n I fear this is intended. Read about in some other place yesterday. Though I can't figure out the reasoning behind it.\n Steps:\n1. Create new project in Xcode 7\n2. Set UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance to \"false\" in Info.plist\nIt's works for me.\n @ihenk No, Framework7 is intended for pure web apps that don't use Xcode nor the iOS SDK at all. They use a meta tag to be able to be added to the homescreen as a fullscreen web app.\n @RandomGenius \n\n> Framework7 is intended for pure web apps that don't use Xcode nor the iOS SDK at all\n\nNope, Framework7 is intended to be used as a Cordova/Phonegap app, pure web app is not a 100% F7's target.\n Guys, i am closing this issue as it is iOS issue, it just doesn't open webapp in fullscreen. Cordova apps works fine with status bar overlay\n It's fixed in iOS 9.2 !\n Seriously?

Will someone give me an example building a list view in javascript.  I have tried to do it with and without Virtual Listview.  Here is my situation:\nI have an html page with an empty list view.  I am unable to initialize the list view using the instructions in the documentation.  My list is items are constructed from data base info.  I have tried initializing in the home page init.  I have tried initializing outside the init.  In both cases I get vl.pageContent[0].offsetHeight undefined in framework7.js.\n\nThanks!\n Hi Vladimir,\n\nI am having a tough time with Virtual Listview.  I have to use the virtual list view because I am building the list view from a database.  The list view as shown works if it is static.  I will keep the question very simple.  \nI have a list view in a file different from called other.html that has the following data:\n\n```\n<div class=\"pages\">\n    <div data-page=\"projects\" class=\"page no-toolbar no-navbar\">\n        <div class=\"page-content\">\n\n            <div class=\"navbarpages\">\n                <div class=\"nav_left_logo\"><a href=\"index.html\"><img src=\"images_mobix/logo.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></div>\n                <div class=\"nav_right_button\"><a href=\"#\" data-popup=\".popup-menu\" class=\"open-popup\"><img src=\"images_mobix/icons/white/menu.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div id=\"pages_maincontent\">\n\n                <h2 class=\"page_title\">My Requests</h2>\n                <div class=\"page\" data-page=\"my_requests\">\n                <div class=\"page_content\">\n\n                    <ul class=\"features_list_detailed list-block virtual-list\">\n\n                        <li>\n                            <div class=\"feat_small_icon\"><img src=\"images_mobix/icons/black/photos.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></div>\n                            <div class=\"feat_small_details\">\n                                <h4>Photo gallery</h4>\n                                <a href=\"photos.html\">Easy create your own photo gallery app. List and full screen options available.</a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"photos.html\"><img src=\"images_mobix/load_posts_disabled.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></div>\n                        </li>\n</ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>\n```\n\nOn my .js page I have the following relevant code.  I did not include the variables in the template to keep it simple.  I am assuming the result would be a list view with identical items as shown in the template.:\nvar vl;\n\n```\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function (e) {\n                myApp.onPageInit('my_requests', function(){\n                                  vl  = myApp.virtualList('.list-block',{                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              template: '<li><div class=\"feat_small_icon\"><img src=\"images_mobix/icons/black/photos.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></div><div class=\"feat_small_details\"><h4>Photo gallery</h4><a href=\"photos.html\">Easy create your own photo gallery app. List and full screen options available.</a></div><div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"photos.html\"><img src=\"images_mobix/load_posts_disabled.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></div></li>',\n});});});\n\nvar format_loans = function() {\n        for (facebook_i=0; facebook_i < facebook_objData.length; facebook_i++) {\n            rowTemplate += '<li><div class=\"feat_small_icon\"><img src=\"images_mobix/icons/black/photos.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></div><div class=\"feat_small_details\"><h4>From ' +facebook_objData[facebook_i].loaner_name +' on ' + facebook_objData[facebook_i].create_date +'</h4><a href=\"photos.html\">' +facebook_objData[facebook_i].loan_message +'</a></div><div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"photos.html\"><img src=\"images_mobix/load_posts.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" /></a></div></li>,';\n            }\n        vl.appendItem(facebook_objData);\n};\n```\n\nI am stuck and can not get list views to work that need refreshing such as the one dipicted above.\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nThanks!\nHoward\n\n> On Jun 20, 2015, at 4:00 AM, Vladimir Kharlampidi notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> var vl \n Hi Vladimir,\n\nI think I see the light.

I'll get the Unity developer to do a build and we will see if the scrolling is any better.\n\nDo you have any idea why it scrolls so badly in Android Chrome? Is this a issue I can try and help fix?\nThe more I use Framework 7 & the more I love it! I don't want to change back to another framework.\n\nI'm happy to pay you for your time to help solve this issue if it is fixable :) \n @nimeso it could be a lot of things.. do the framework7 kitchen sink also work slow? if not its some problem in your side.. check the chrome devtools timeline panel\n Try this greensock.com 's draggable \n @nolimits4web I can confirm this issue with the latest Firefox and Chrome too. I ran a FF profiler and the spent most of the time spent on the following (without playing the videos):\n- plusone.js (12.4%)\n- www-embed-player.js (12.03%)\n- html5player (3.64%)\n\nThe framework7.js ate just 1.47% of the resources. I think this going to be a Youtube issue.\n @nolimits4web: no, it was in the OP's code: http://staging.onefatsheep.com/~vizstage/plattar/themes/default/framework7/js/framework7.min.js\n Wow thanks guys!\nI can confirm it's fine in newer browsers :) And yes, the youtube videos\nembed don't help.

In the iOS9/Safari9 it will be possible to have the blurred look introduced in iOS7 using `-webkit-backdrop-filter`. \nThis PR will add basic support for this in the `.navbar` and `.toolbar`. I also modified photoBrowser.js to support a `blurred` option. The kitchen-sink demo is updated accordingly. \n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54MT0fSWO7w) is how it looks on an iPad running iOS9 \n Awesome. \n I only tested it on the latest iPad Air 2.\n Good job\uff01\n The Apple website uses this effect as well.\n\nbackground: rgba(255,255,255,.65),\n-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)\n\nWorks well\n someone\nit has been tested on a mobile android\n Could this be rebased and merged? There seems to be demand for this. I agree, this would be a cool feature. Either this or #1040 should be merged if performance is good.\r\n\r\nIf it runs smoothly on mid-tier devices, it should be ok since devices are getting faster and faster in the future.\r\n\r\nLet's say if it uns smoothly on iPhone 5s (or newer) and iPad Air (or newer), then it should be ok. They both run the Apple A7 chip and will still be supported by Apple in the next version of iOS while older devices might not.\r\n\r\nBut imho the feature should be **opt-in only**, so devs would have to flip `headerTranslucency:true` or sth like that in config if they're sure that they want to trade in translucency-effect for less performance.\r\n\r\nBy default, translucency should be turned off in my opinion.

English is not too good. Hey.\n    The app method formToJSON() doesn't convert to JSON at all. It actually returns a key-value structured javascript OBJECT.\n\nIf this is the intended behavior, the name of the method is quite misleading. Even, the Framework7 manual says: \"formToJSON(form) - convert form fields valus to JSON\".\n\nSuggestion: Either change the implementation of the formToJSON method so that it really returns a JSON string, or change the name of the method and the manual text to something that doesn't use the word JSON at all.\n\n---\n\nPS. I think there are several other occasions throughout Framework7 and the manual that add to this confusion between javascript objects and JSON strings. It would be great if you could clean these up consistently.\n\nNotice: JSON is a text format (string), not a key-value javascript object. These are two completely different types.\nIn your manual you write things like \"formData - object with form data in JSON format\". This doesn't make any sense. There is no such thing as a javascript object in JSON format.\n  In the android browser the inputs scroll into view only after typing, not on focus, which is ok but when i open it as a full screen web app, the inputs don't scroll into view at all even when typing. The keyboard covers the text. I tried using a scrollto plugin but it doesn't work because the page isn't long enough to scroll the input to the top. \n i have same problem, but this in android device, not browser.\nwhen input in bottom position, android keyboard covers the input.\ni try scrolltop, but scrolltop just work with `.page-content` class, not `input`.\ni think textarea have others problem, when i type more than 73 rows, it's covers by keyboard, i can't see what i typed in textarea.\n\nInput screenshot : \n![input issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5948326/13876969/64b4e6fa-ed3a-11e5-91be-36e921769dd5.jpg)\n\ntextarea screenshot : \n![textarea issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5948326/13876974/7014e270-ed3a-11e5-9975-6d4e35353a48.jpg)\n\nHow to make input or textarea's position stay on the top of keyboard when focus or typed ?\nI use android lollipop.\nthanks.\n I have same problem.\n Same problem here, tried the scrollTo but no success by the same reason. @cande1gut i have same problem and also scrollTo is not working for me please let me know if you solve d problem @atukilham hey man u got d answer? @bhumin3i I got it working with a timeout, since you have to wait for the keyboard to show up, to let the browser calculate the scroll once the keyboard is on screen:\r\n\r\n`$$(\"input\").on(\"focus\", function(){`\r\n    `setTimeout((function() {`\r\n      `$$('.page-content').scrollTo(0, $$(\"input\").offset().top, 500, function() {`\r\n      `});`\r\n    `}), 500);`  Hello, I'm using framework7 1.0.6 and I'm using search bar to trigger ajax requests:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"pages\">\n    <div data-page=\"list\" class=\"page with-subnavbar\">\n\n    <!-- Search bar -->\n    <form class=\"searchbar\">\n        <div class=\"searchbar-input\">\n            <input type=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search\">\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"searchbar-clear\"></a>\n        </div>\n        <a href=\"#\" class=\"searchbar-cancel\">Cancel</a>\n    </form>\n\n    <!-- Search bar overlay -->\n    <div class=\"searchbar-overlay\"></div>\n\n        <div class=\"page-content hide-bars-on-scroll\">\n            <div class=\"list-block contacts-list media-list\">\n        <ul></ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n``` js\n    var mySearchbar = app.f7.searchbar('.searchbar', {\n        customSearch: true\n    });\n    $$('.searchbar').on(\"search\", function(e) {\n        console.log(\"search \" + e.target.value);\n        mySearchbar.disable();\n    });\n```\n\nThis works great except that search bar clear button & overlay not showing up.\n I find the reason, you need to specify [searchbar-init] class in form element.\n   Hi, is there a way i can re-render the previous Page instance on back button click?\n\nI have list and a list detail page, the details has the functionality to change the name of the list Item\n\nList click on item 1 -> list detail (item 1) and re-name item 1 to item 2 ( with a server call).\nWhen going back i still see the cached page instance with item 1.\n\nI can get the page instance and also change the name in DOM but i would like it to redownload json from the server with the latest items and also with the renamed item.\n\nAny of this available ? maybe remove the old page instance cache somehow and force it to recreate it?\n Anyway we can catch a callback for router.refreshPreviousPage() or .router.reloadPreviousPage()\nI would like trigger router.back() when the content of my previous page is refreshed.\n @ZanderBrown : no more problem my side, I guess you can close this issue.

The switch-toggle is aligned to left instead of right.\n Maybe it s a personal taste, however, I have not seen any app on iphones where switch-toggle is not aligned to right;) On Ipad (larger screens), maybe, it s okay to leave that on the left side.\n from a quick search it looks like you are right:\nhttps://www.google.co.il/search?q=ios+8+switch&newwindow=1&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=q65cVZHxCoqcsgGBx4CIBQ&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ\n  This is an attempt to improve the kitchen-sink demo application for newcomers that will show the html and jade files from the current page.\n Hello !\n\nI works with all pages not only modals !\nIt's what I could understand and do so far no other reason than that and as I said it could help others too.\nFell free to make any adjustments if you think it can be worth !\n\nCheer !\n  Actually, f7 does only provide page-transistion from right-to-left and vice versa. Would be nice to provide other (hardware-accelareted) transistions as well. (Examples: http://tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/)\n\nWe could put the kind of transistion within a-tag by class-names (or by adding transistion-class to .navbar-header):\n\n`<a href=\u201c../tpl/create_user.html\u201d class=\u201clink\u201d id=\u201cicon-add-channel\u201d class=\u201ctransistion-bottom-to-top\u201d>+</a>`\n\nWould be nice to provide css-classes for different sliding effects, this would enhance UX-Feeling;)\n yes, you are right. I guess, it is best to close this request. It really breaks native ux, so this feature request is senseless. Please close this request. Thx.\n I'm also interested in this because the \"slide in from the bottom\" transistion is native to iOS.\nSee what happens when you make a new appointment in the Calendar app. It slides up from the bottom.\n\nIs there any way to do this with Framework7?\n It slides up because it's a popup. if you want a popup use a popup\n  The documentation of f7 contains examples with div-tags within label-tags. \n\nFor example (copied from http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/checkboxes-radios.html): \n`<label class=\"label-checkbox item-content\">\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"my-checkbox\" value=\"Books\" checked=\"checked\">\n        <div class=\"item-media\">\n          <i class=\"icon icon-form-checkbox\"></i>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"item-inner\">\n          <div class=\"item-title\">Books</div>\n        </div>\n      </label>`\n\n_According to html-spec, this is not allowed, hence html-validatiors would complain that._\n(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18609554/is-div-inside-label-block-correct).\n\n**Would be better to replace divs within label with span-elements or do the divs out of the label-tags.**\n Yes, I know, it works;) however, it is not valid html. Automated tests would complain such structure..is there any good reason why you use divs instead of spans within label-tags? (I will replace all such divs with spans..)\n  If client code tries to close same modal more than once, modal will not shows anymore.\nThis happens because closeModal creates subscription to `transitionEnd` event twice or more.\nI have introduced a flag `f7-modal-closing`, which prevents multiple executions of `closeModal`\nmethod until `closed` event is fired.\n\nAlso, this PR moves removing of flag `f7-modal-shown` from `close` event to `closed`, because\nmodal should be marked as `shown` directly to the end of all animations of closing.\n @nolimits4web try to call `closeModal()` method more than once, and strictly before `closed` event is fired, and try to open same modal again.\n    Hello !\n\nDoing tests with framework7 I found a memory with kitchen-sink under chromium/chrome, to reproduce we need to open http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/ navigate to:\n\n\"Forms\" -> \"Form Elements\" and once there -> \"Forms\" (back button on top).\n\nIf we continue switching between \"Form Elements\" and back (\"Forms\") with the chromium/chrome taskmanager open we can see that the memory only increase each time we switch (for me around 1 megabyte for each 2 or 3 switches).\n\nFor a long running application this is a problem, I plan to make an offline application with framework7 and this application can remain open weeks.\n\nI'll continue testing to see if other iteractions also cause memory leaks.\n\nCheers !\n Hello again !\nIt seems that I did not understood correctly how chrome taskmanger/profiler works altough the total memory/tab reported always grow the  javascript memory goes up and/down.\n\nBut the number of nodes do not goes down the same way.\n![framework7-memory-profiler](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/462618/7671451/91131b3a-fcc8-11e4-853c-447c6a6062c9.png)\n GC can't happen in many case: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12658212/3188624 . The GC algorithm and kickin  depend on the JS engine. I haven't tried with this particular case, but you can trigger a GC in Firefox in about:memory to confirm the leakage.\n  I have form with Multiple HTML elements. How can I reload this content value on Ajax success? \n\nI am using this framework in PhoneGap.\n\nI tried - mainView.router.reloadContent(content);\n\n```\n$$.ajax({\n        type:'POST',\n        url: \"http://www.xyz.co/upload.php\",\n        dataType:'text',\n        data:{'data':data}, \n                    success:function(data){     \n                        myApp.hidePreloader();\n                        myApp.alert(data, 'Yay Success!');\n                        var productsPageHTML = $$('#view-1').html();\n                        mainView.router.reloadContent(productsPageHTML);\n                            }\n\n    });         \n```\n\nBuy its not working?\n  The form element \"switch\" only toggles after click, but does not toggle by swipe left/right. In ios, we can make the toggle also by swipe left/right. Would be nice to enhance the f7 \"switch\"-form to adapt the ux of ios. Thanks!\n I think its should come as a plugin.. like you said it not worth it for most of the apps\n Plugin would be bad. I guess, users expect native user experience and most of the users expect that a \"slider toggle\" behaves like a slider toggle and not like a checkbox. A good idea would be to make it optional (for example, by assigning a class to the slider-toogle or by providing a global parameter such as \"nativeSliderFeeling=true\". There are a lot of users sliding the slider instead of clicking, because it is a slider-toogle;)\n I use this code to solve this Problem:\n\n```\n(function () {\n\n    // Checkbox drag extention\n    var m_IsDraggingCheckbox = false;\n\n    function handleTouchStart(e) {\n        var touchStartX = e.targetTouches[0].clientX;\n        var input = $$(this).parent().find('input');\n\n        if (input[0].checked && touchStartX > ($$(this).offset().left + $$(this).width() / 2))\n            m_IsDraggingCheckbox = true;\n        else if (!input[0].checked && touchStartX < ($$(this).offset().left + $$(this).width() / 2))\n            m_IsDraggingCheckbox = true;\n        else\n            m_IsDraggingCheckbox = false;\n\n        if(m_IsDraggingCheckbox)\n             e.preventDefault();\n    }\n\n    function handleTouchMove(e) {\n        if (!m_IsDraggingCheckbox)\n            return;\n\n        var touchStartX = e.targetTouches[0].clientX;\n        var input = $$(this).parent().find('input');\n\n        if (touchStartX > ($$(this).offset().left + $$(this).width() / 2))\n            input[0].checked = true;\n        else if (touchStartX < ($$(this).offset().left + $$(this).width() / 2))\n            input[0].checked = false;\n    }\n\n    function handleTouchEnd(e) {\n        m_IsDraggingCheckbox = false;\n    }\n\n\n    $$(document).on(myApp.touchEvents.start, '.label-switch .checkbox', handleTouchStart);\n    $$(document).on(myApp.touchEvents.move, '.label-switch .checkbox', handleTouchMove);\n    $$(document).on(myApp.touchEvents.end, '.label-switch .checkbox', handleTouchEnd);\n\n})();\n```\n\nThis could be a hint, how this problem could be solved.\nMaybe someone could integrate it in a better way in the framework.\n for inspiration (material design) \"toggle-button\" by google:\n\nhttps://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-toggle-button?active=paper-toggle-button&view=demo:demo/index.html\n @SammySoft Thank you very much for this solution. I have observed many iOS users who **only** swipe on toggles, they don't even know that you can just tap them. This should definitely be included in the F7 Framework.\n This would probably be a good candidate for a configuration option on app initialization. So you could do something like this if you wanted it enabled:\n\n``` javascript\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    switchSwipe: true // enable swipe-to-switch on switch form elements\n});\n```\n If you use SammySoft's code and have a change event on the checkbox/switch you have to trigger the event manually in the handleTouchMove-function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!m_IsDraggingCheckbox)\r\n\t\t\treturn;\r\n\r\n\t\tvar touchStartX = e.targetTouches[0].clientX;\r\n\t\tvar input = $$(this).parent().find('input');\r\n\t\tvar changetrigger=false;\r\n\r\n\t\tif (touchStartX > ($$(this).offset().left + $$(this).width() / 2)) {\r\n\t\t\tif (!input[0].checked) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t changetrigger=true;\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tinput[0].checked = true;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t} else if (touchStartX < ($$(this).offset().left + $$(this).width() / 2)) {\r\n\t\t\tif (input[0].checked) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t changetrigger=true;\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tinput[0].checked = false;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif (changetrigger) {\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tinput.trigger(\"change\");\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Hi,\n\nThere is an issue in the Calendar formatter regexp.

But, when the page reload itself (like below), then I cannot get `picker.cols[0].value`.\n\n``` javascript\n// Page Reload\nmainView.router.load({\n    url: 'picker.html',\n    reload: true,\n    ignoreCache: true\n});\n```\n  Hey Vladimir, loving the product so far!\n\nI'm running into an issue where I load several pages with:\n\n``` javascript\nview.router.load(\n{\n    content: pageContent,\n    query: {foo: bar, ...}\n}\n```\n\nThis works fine, but I have an issue when using `router.back`.  Imagine I have the following setup:\n\n```\n----------       ----------       ----------\n|        |       |        |       |        |\n| Page 1 |  ==>  | Page 2 |  ==>  | Page 3 |\n|        |       |        |       |        |\n----------       ----------       ----------\n\n```\n\nWhen `router.back` is called (or the \"back\" toolbar link pressed) when Page 3 is active, the `onPageInit` event is called for Page 1, but `page.query` is an empty object when I would expect it to be the query with which the page was initially loaded.  Am I missing something or could this be a bug?  I need a way to get data to a page that is loaded as the result of a `router.back` call.\n\nThanks,\nPeter\n haha thanks.  I managed to work around it by reorganizing my class structure.\n Hi @nolimits4web \nI have the same issue.\n\nI enabled domChache when I was creating this view\n\n``` javascript\napp.addView('.my-view', {\n    dynamicNavbar: true,\n    domCache: true\n});\n```\n\nAnd navigate between pages inside current view using this:\n\n``` javascript\napp.getCurrentView().router.load({\n    content: pageContent,\n    query: {foo: bar, ...}\n});\n```\n\nBut when I navigate back using element with \"back\" class, old pages do not keep their data (I mean query data).\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).on('pageBeforeInit', function (e) {\n    console.log(e.detail.page.query)); // is empty when I navigate back\n});\n```\n\nCan you suggest something?\nThank you.\n @fernap3 or can you suggest some workaround that you made?\n Hey @sanks, I ended up persisting the data in an object outside of Framework7 so I didn't need to use they page query object.\n @nolimits4web I built dev version but it still not works.\n @nolimits4web thank you, `pageReinit` helps.\n  Fix Issue #454 \n Thanks for your response! It happened on the lastest Mac Chrome.\n  The document says:\n\n> Content type will be the same as specified in form's \"enctype\" attribute. By default (if not specified), it is application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nBut:\n1. If `enctype` attribute is not specified, the `Content-Type` is `null`\n2. If `enctype` attribute is specified as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, the `Content-Type` is also `null`\n\n![f7-2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/352986/6979321/de5a6abe-da14-11e4-8138-9dc14efb7faa.jpeg)\n  ``` javascript\n// Initialize your app\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    modalTitle: 'Framework7',\n    animateNavBackIcon: true\n});\n\n// Export selectors engine\nvar $$ = Dom7;\n\n// Add view\nvar mainView = myApp.addView('.main-view', {\n    dynamicNavbar: true\n});\nvar loginPage = myApp.addView('.login', {\n    dynamicNavbar: true,\n    domCache: true\n});\n\n/*==== register-1 page ====*/\nmyApp.onPageInit('register-1', function() {\n    var thisPage = $$('.page[data-page=\"register-1\"]');\n    thisPage.on('click', '.button', function() {\n        loginPage.router.loadPage('register-2.html');\n    });\n});\n\n/*==== register-2 page====*/\nmyApp.onPageInit('register-2', function() {\n    var thisPage = $$('.page[data-page=\"register-2\"]');\n    thisPage.on('click', '.button', function() {\n        loginPage.router.loadPage('register-3.html');\n    });\n});\n\n/*==== register-3 page====*/\nmyApp.onPageInit('register-3', function() {\n    var thisPage = $$('.page[data-page=\"register-3\"]');\n    thisPage.on('click', '.button', function() {\n        loginPage.goBack(); \n    });\n});\n\n```\n @nolimits4web \n- It can only go back to the register-1.html\n- And can not go back to the loginPage(data-page=\"firstPageName\") of main.html. \n  Look at the picture\n\nright\n![right](http://img02.taobaocdn.com/imgextra/i2/1134915854/TB2H3BXcpXXXXX8XpXXXXXXXXXX_!!1134915854.png)\nwrong\n![wrong](http://img02.taobaocdn.com/imgextra/i2/1134915854/TB2Dg7.cXXXXXa3XpXXXXXXXXXX_!!1134915854.png)\n\n## main.html\n\n``` html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <div class=\"views tabs toolbar-through\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"login-screen\">\n    <div class=\"view login\">\n      <div class=\"navbar\">\n        <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n          ...\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"pages\">\n        <div class=\"page navbar-fixed\" data-page=\"login-screen\">\n          <div class=\"page-content\">\n            ...\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n```\n\n## register-*.html\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"navbar\">\n  <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"pages\">\n  <div class=\"page navbar-fixed\" data-page=\"register-*\">\n    <div class=\"page-content\">\n      ...\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n @nolimits4web \n Problem solved. you did me a great favor, thanks\n  I've noticed on devices with 1.5 dppx displays, the \"bars\" menu icon appears blurry.  I've pasted the offending CSS below, along with a proposed solution, tested on devices with 1, 1.5, and 2dppx.  I don't understand this media query:\n\n@media all and (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio: 1), (max-resolution: 120dppx)\n\nNo device (that I know of) has a 120dppx display; I'm not really sure what this is trying to do.  Note that similar media queries also exist elsewhere in the CSS.\nThanks!\n\nPeter\n\n**Current CSS:**\n\ni.icon.icon-bars {\n  width: 21px;\n  height: 13px;\n  background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2042%2026'%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D'%23007aff'%20d%3D'M0%2C0h4v4H0V0z%20M8%2C1h34v2H8V1z%20M0%2C11h4v4H0V11z%20M8%2C12h34v2H8V12z%20M0%2C22h4v4H0V22z%20M8%2C23h34v2H8V23z'%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\");\n}\n@media all and (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio: 1), (max-resolution: 120dppx) {\n  i.icon.icon-bars {\n    height: 14px;\n    background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2021%2014'%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D'%23007aff'%20d%3D'M0%2C0h2v2H0V0z%20M4%2C0h17v1H4V0z%20M0%2C6h2v2H0V6z%20M4%2C6h17v1H4V6z%20M0%2C12h2v2H0V12z%20M4%2C12h17v1H4V12z'%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\");\n  }\n}\n\n**My Solution:**\n\ni.icon.icon-bars {\n  width: 21px;\n  height: 14px;\n  background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2021%2014'%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D'%23007aff'%20d%3D'M0%2C0h2v2H0V0z%20M4%2C0h17v1H4V0z%20M0%2C6h2v2H0V6z%20M4%2C6h17v1H4V6z%20M0%2C12h2v2H0V12z%20M4%2C12h17v1H4V12z'%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\");\n}\n@media all and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (min-resolution: 2dppx) {\n  i.icon.icon-bars {\n    height: 13px;\n    background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2042%2026'%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D'%23007aff'%20d%3D'M0%2C0h4v4H0V0z%20M8%2C1h34v2H8V1z%20M0%2C11h4v4H0V11z%20M8%2C12h34v2H8V12z%20M0%2C22h4v4H0V22z%20M8%2C23h34v2H8V23z'%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\");\n  }\n}\n Thanks for responding so quickly!  I would still include the \"min-resolution\" part of the media query as that seems to be the CSS standard going forward:\n\n(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (min-resolution: 2ddpx)\n  I updated

hope I can pass a value can modify toolbar and the height of the navigation bar.\nBecause every time to modify the CSS and framework7 source file is very troublesome.\n\nthanks!\n  The following is my

issue when using the 3d panels plugin where selector.nodeType would error when selector was undefined\n There could be a better fix but I just needed to clear the error for now\n When using 3d panels, it was throwing when the panel opened (latest code f7 code and panels code)\n  Status codes other than 200 are successful. Update to reflect the correct range.\n With xhr (not network inspector), the 3xx status codes will be automatically dealt with, you will never see a 301 status code for example, it will perform the redirect internally and return the next status code :)\n < 300 is OK also, updated. My main concern was getting failures for 201 etc, which was causing me issues\n  Fixes issue causing active state on elements to be prematurely removed.\n\nSee #387.\n See #387.\n That makes sense. Whatever you feel is best.\n\nHappy to have that active state stuff sorted!\n Changed. Should be right now.\n\nYou may still want to merge manually to get my ugly commits out of there.\n  Hi Vladimir,\n\nI use F7 with Template7 pages enabled.\nOn a \"<a>\" link item I have two actions. One enable by F7 with ajax load of a T7 page, Another one trigger on click that set a global variable using HTML5 data attribute.\n\nthere is my template7 pages history : wizard.html -> wizard-language.html -> wizard-server.html\n\nthis is my second action on click :\n\n```\n$$(document).on('click', '.wizard-setLocale', function (e) {\n    var locale = $$(this)[0].dataset.locale;\n    if (i18n.locale !== locale) {\n        i18n.locale = locale;\n        mainView.router.refreshPage();\n    }\n});\n```\n\nI have try refreshPage() and refreshPreviousPage() (I think i could be fire after page init) but In both cases my wizard-language is update but If I go back to wizard.html, it has changed. I use an helper for localization.\n\nAny idea ?\n Ok I found a solution by disabling one action using href='#' for the current page but It doesn't work for the previous page\n Ok I close this issue for the moment because I can't work on my project. Will reopen it if necessary\n  Hello, I want open page in popup by click on link.\nFor example \n\n``` html\n<a class=\"link\" href=\"page/about.html\">About</a>\n```\n\nAnd I dont want load about.html content before.\nIs it possible to load page content and show in popup by link?\n Ok, thanks.\nI think it would be useful if this feature in the future will be default.\n Yes, it's easy. Just was wondering whether there is a possibility by default.\nThanks for your reply :)\n @nolimits4web   will it works if I have links in the .popup page?  \nif I click the links in the popup page ,  where will the page be loaded?\n @nolimits4web,  Vlad am using three tabs based layout structure. each tab has many inner pages, an inner page has navigation to 3tabs. when I click on the links it's not showing respective tabs.

After debugging i found that allowItemClick is false in the method handleDayClick, after a normal mouseclick operation. It has something to do with the mechanism that detects if a mouseup is considered a click or move operation.\nI therefor set touchmove to false to make sure the day clicks always work.\n\nRegards,\nMartijn\n Hi,\n\nThx for the fix. The second issue i can't reproduce either when i test\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/calendar.html#.VQvSsI6G8rE \nThat issue only came up within our own framework7 application. For now, I cannot find the time to provide a step by step guide that matches our usage scenario of the datepicker.\n\nI think this might not be a datepicker issue, but has to do with our own application.\nSo for now you can close the issue and when i can reproduce the issue i will reopen it.\n\nThx.\n  ``` css\n\n@media (min-width: 768px)\n.tabbar .toolbar-inner {\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n\n```\n\nwith justify-content tabs in toolbar displays wrong\n\nBrowser Chrome 41\n\nexample GIF\n![framework7-tabbar-issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/264697/6627562/fe9e64c6-c90f-11e4-9b78-83b53d101895.gif)\n  I have a prompt modal in the swiper. It works as expected on pc. On mobile (IOS 8) when I try to enter text, only the first character is pressed and the remaining characters are blocked. When I try to set value by e.g. `$('.modal-text-input').val('abcdef')` it works as expected. What is going on?\n Ok, it was me :). I changed in my css this\n\n```\n* {\n    -webkit-touch-callout: none;\n    -webkit-user-select: none; /* Disable selection/copy in UIWebView */\n   }\n```\n\ninto\n\n```\n*:not(input,textarea) {\n    -webkit-touch-callout: none;\n    -webkit-user-select: none; /* Disable selection/copy in UIWebView */\n   }\n```\n\nAnd now it works again :). \n  I have a weird problem with Framework7 1.0.3. I have `input radio` list by Framework 7. Content (input elements) and checked change is driven by Knockout.js binding.\n\nFour click events are assigned to every input radio element: `Framework.js line 5952`,  `JQuery 2.1.3 line 4112`, `Framework.js line 9158` and  `JQuery 2.1.3 line 4112`. When I click on pc everything works as expected.\n\nWhen I click on IOS or Android phone the last JQuery event is never called. The process is as follows:\n1. Framework7 Handetouchend is fired\n2. Framework7 Click event is fired with `forwardedtouchevent` set to true\n3. JQuery click event is fired\n4. Framework7 Click event is fired with no `forwardedtouchevent` and therefore `allowclick` remains as false\n5. Second JQuery click event is never fired\n\nI guess that the second click event is ghost event but I wonder why it comes sooner than the second JQuery click event. As mentioned, the second JQuery event is produced by Knockout.js `checked` binding.\n When I deactivate fastClick, all the events work fine on IOS - so there must be something wrong in fastClick or Swiper or both :). What exactly is the `needsFastClick TimeOut` supposed to do? You declare a variable, then you fill it with setTimout and then you destroy it.\n I have installed https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick to see what happens. The problem persisted also with that library. I have set all the problematic nodes to `class=\"needsclick\"` and that solved the problem.

The problem that I experience is that the state of the control is handled via pure css (psuedo class \"checked\") and no markup changes can be observed thus knockout is just not capable of controlling the data binding between the view object and the corresponding data field.\n\nAny help will be appreciated...\n  Hi! A few code consistency enhancement:\n\u2014 hasOwnProperty is important because just Object.prototype.someMethod = '...'  can break code execution (It can be just shim or users helpers);\n\u2014 removed unused variables;\n\u2014 added var paramsPrefix, it has improved two places at code;\n No i didn't and don't have possibility at the current time.\nAlso about 'text/javascript'. It isn't required today.\n Yes, you're right, it's not important today. I've checked es6shim and it's don't write into the prototype.\n\nOnly that anti-pattern can bring to unexpected result:\nObject.prototype.someCoolMethod = function(){ console.log('!') };\n$.serializeObject({one: 'two'}) // => one=two&someCoolMethod=function%20(){%20console.log(%27!%27);%20}\n\nI'l remove checks. But i've seen performance test `for in` vs. `forEach` and forEach was faster and looks better (and no need for 'own' check). I would replace all `for in` to the `Object.keys/forEach/map`.

In my current solution using the `$$('.tab').on('show', function(){ })` event I have to overcome a lot of \"issues\" which already have been implemented within F7 (which is awesome, did I mention that :)), it feels a bit like I am reinventing the wheel. Therefore this request.\n\nCurrent \"issues\" that we need to overcome;\n- handling the whole request via e.g. `mainView.router.load(options)`\n  - to leverage Template7 etc.\n- caching / reloading\n- page \"transitions\" e.g. showing the `myApp.showIndicator();`\n- etc.\n I do not use tab-on event for loading tab-content:\n\n``` javascript\n$('#tab1').on('show', function () {\n   //refresh tab here\n});\n```\n\nI load the tab-contents with the following method:\n\n``` javascript\n\nin app-js:\nview_tab_1.router.load({url: 'src/tab_1.html', animatePages: false})\n\nin index.html:\n<div id=\"view_1\" class=\"view view-main tab\">\n        <!-- Navbar-->\n        <div class=\"navbar\">\n            <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n                <div class=\"center\">1</div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <!-- Pages-->\n        <div class=\"pages navbar-through\"><!--loaded by router--!></div>\n      </div>\n\n\nin tab_1.html:\n<!-- Navbar-->\n<div class=\"navbar\">\n    <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n        <div class=\"center\">Tab 1</div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" data-page=\"p-contacts\">\n    <div class=\"page-content\">\n        <div class=\"content-block-title\">..</div>\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n            ..\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Which way is better? \"on-event\" or \"navigator\"?**\n Maybe, it would be better to provide something like \"page-load\"-property to load a view dynamically without triggering a link in html or using the \".router.load\"-method. For example:\n\n`<div class=\"pages navbar-through\" data-page-load=\"src/tab1.html\"></div>`\n\nThis will load the content of tab1.html in index.html (only) one time when index.html is rendered.\n I'm sure someone could come up with a more elegant permanent solution.\r\n\r\nI'm using the Material scrolling tabbar. I haven't tested this with anything else. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing 1.5.0 if you change lines 7552-7554 from \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n                if (clicked.hasClass('tab-link')) {\r\n                    isTabLink = true;\r\n                    app.showTab(clickedData.tab || clicked.attr('href'), clicked);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n                if (clicked.hasClass('tab-link')) {\r\n                    isLink = true;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll force a tab-link to act like a normal link. Which means if you're using the default ajax links the tab links start acting like any other link. If you throw the \"no-animation\" class on the tab link you can barely tell the difference between it and the non-ajax tabs. Hitting the back button looks slightly off but I can live with it for now.\r\n\r\nI should also note that this relies on the HTML having an identical set of tabs at the top of each page and manually marking the active tab on the server side (or any other manual way). +1 or more specific case:\r\nmake scrollable toolbar normal linkable and no tab like  Is there a way to have the smart select list be inset?

Looks like it is not loading the framework7.js file at all.\n\nIs there any method to solve this problem? Thanks a lot!!!\n  This issue exists with [fastClicks = false].\n\nI think the preventDefault on touchstart event to prevent overlay scrolling is to restrictive.\n\nFor example it will prevent a click event on .panel-overlay. And thus closing a open panel by clicking 'outside' of it doesn't work anymore.\n\nThe offending code:\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/clicks.js#L316-L322\n\n```\n    // Prevent scrolling on overlays\n    function preventScrolling(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n    }\n    if (app.support.touch) {\n        $(document).on('touchstart', '.panel-overlay, .modal-overlay, .preloader-indicator-overlay, .popup-overlay, .searchbar-overlay', preventScrolling);\n    }\n```\n\nThis is one of the events that will no longer be possible to occur:\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/clicks.js#L63-L105\n\n```\n    function handleClicks(e) {\n\n        ....\n\n        if (clicked.hasClass('panel-overlay') && app.params.panelsCloseByOutside) {\n            app.closePanel();\n        }\n```\n\nI suggest to change the touchstart event to touchmove. This will still prevent scrolling, but not block the touchstart/touchend event properly shooting off the click event.\n I can reproduce it actually.\n1. I downloaded the latest version.\n2. Update kitchen-sink\\js\\kitchen-sink.js. Change \n\n```\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    modalTitle: 'Framework7',\n    animateNavBackIcon: true\n});\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    modalTitle: 'Framework7',\n    animateNavBackIcon: true,\n    fastClicks: false\n});\n```\n1. Host it locally somehow, open on Safari on iOS.\n2. Tap the hamburger menu, and tap outside on the panel-overlay.\n3. The hamburger menu won't close.\n\nWith fastClicks turned on it obviously does work. Since your're eventually manually firing the Click event\n  First of, thanks for this amazing project!!\n\nI do however experience a small issue. In the simulator/browser everything works fine when clicking the \"< Back\" (back link). On a device however \"< Back\" does not always respond:\n- when tapping it fast;\n- when you tab, hold and drag.\n\nIt is clearly visible that in both scenario's the \"active-state\" class gets applied, you can see the opacity changing (to 0.3) but the page is not going back as expected. \n\nIn iOS however, as long as you start you \"touchstart\" on a \"< Back\" link, no matter if you make a drag movement afterwards, or tap it really fast, you always go back.\n\nFramework7 v1.0.2\niPhone 6, iOS 8.1.3 (real device)\nDeployed the \"/dist\" folder from the master to the device (PhoneGap).\n Thanks, I'll look into it and let you know if it fixed things for me.\n That worked for me. I am thinking the default for it should be more like 20 and not 0.\n\nI have downloaded many F7 apps, and they all seem to have that problem on retina devices (maybe because movement is more common on denser screens)\n Likely related to #444 \n  Currently if you want to use dom cached pages with navbars, you have to do something like this:\n\n```\n.views\n  .view\n    .navbar\n      .navbar-inner\n      .navbar-inner cached data-page=about\n    .toolbar\n    .pages\n      .page data=page=index\n        .page-content\n      .page cached data=page=about\n        .page-content\n```\n\nbut this creates a lot of problems if you have multiple dom cached pages with every its own navbar as you have to sync the structures.\n\nWouldn't it be much more easier if you can just nest the navbar inside the dom cached page? Like this:\n\n```\n.views\n  .view\n    .navbar\n      .navbar-inner\n    .toolbar\n    .pages\n      .page data=page=index\n        .page-content\n      .page cached data=page=about\n        .navbar\n          .navbar-inner\n        .page-content\n```\n :+1: \n Any plans for material with dynamic navbar?\n\nI just thought of having the same deck.. u can chnage the skin either IOS/Material.. no chnage in structures of navbar etc.\n  i have lot working with framework7's infinite scroll component,i'm trying example code on framework7's docs site, but i'm not achived as expected result \ni want to make news reader app ,that app require data as json , i loaded json data from remote server ,but i have no idea how i integerate fetched json data into infinite scroll ,so how i can achive this purpose,please guid me or you provide full implementation example code on the your's framework7 site,thanks \n thanks\n  See #401 \n Thank you.\n  hi\ni'm created one app framework7 card view component,but card view image not displayed as expected,only half image showed\n it solved yesterday that involved css property ,i changed css property then looks like nice!\n  There is a slight gap between the keyboard and the messages input textarea.\n\n![messages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98803/6225371/e367afb8-b691-11e4-8c07-c7a2e9136070.png)\n  Hello, I use smart-select with search bar. I want make this: when in search result nothing found, show \"Add\" button, and by click, add new option to this smart select. \nPrompt, please, what is the best way to add a new option in the open smart select?\n Yes, I doing like this. But my question is: what i need to write in \n\n``` javascript\n$$(document).on('click', 'a.add-option', function(e) {\n    //do something to add option here\n});\n```\n\nI try add option in select\n\n``` javascript\nselectUsers = $$('select.users'),\nselectUsers.append('<option value=\"' + val + '\">' + val + '</option>');\n```\n\nit's good! And after click to back button and click to select again - all works fine.\nBut how add \"li\" option in open smart select?\nI think is not good write something like this\n\n``` javascript\nselectUsersUl.append('<li><label class=\"label-checkbox item-content\"><input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"' + val + '\" name=\"checkbox-1424113124395\"><div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon icon-form-checkbox\"></i></div><div class=\"item-inner\"><div class=\"item-title\">' + val + '</div></div></label></li>');\n```\n\nIdeally, it is desirable to have a method something like \"addOption\"\n The same, but if one day will change the markup, css classes or something else, it would be better if it be done in a single method.\nAnd I don't know what is name=\"checkbox-1424113124395\" in input?\n  Consider the following code for a list block, or check the list view with right-aligned elements here in kitchen sink:\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"list-block tablet-inset\">\n  <ul>\n    <li><div class=\"item-content\">\n      <div class=\"item-inner\">\n        <div class=\"item-title\">Total balance</div>\n        <div class=\"item-after\" id=\"total-balance\">234.32</div>\n      </div>\n    </div></li>\n    <li><div class=\"item-content\">\n      <div class=\"item-inner\">\n        <div class=\"item-title\">Current month</div>\n        <div id=\"total-balance-month\" class=\"item-after\"><span class=\"color-red\">-45.43</span></div>\n      </div>\n    </div></li>\n    <li><div class=\"item-content\">\n      <div class=\"item-inner\">\n        <div class=\"item-title\">Last month's total</div>\n        <div id=\"total-balance-lastmonth\" class=\"item-after\"><span class=\"color-green\">279.75\n</span></div>\n      </div>\n    </div></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\nFirefox browser (tested in version 35.0.1) seems to have a problem with positioning of the right aligned text in lists. The elements with class \"item-after\" are not aligned at the right, but instead somewhere in the middle of the list row - maybe an issue with flex property. Except for the last element, which is aligned correctly.\n\n**Result in Firefox 35.0.1**\n![alignment_issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5443951/6214438/cd75e254-b5f8-11e4-94b3-6020ba3cef47.png)\n Thanks! I added this fix in my custom app CSS for now.\n  Could you please apply `encodeURIComponent` or `base64` to all occurences of `url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8` in css to make it work also in IE? See here:\n\nhttps://github.com/less/less.js/issues/1716\n Well, I think that you should follow http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397 where it is mentioned that:\n\nWithout \";base64\", the data (as a sequence of octets) is represented using ASCII encoding for octets inside the range of safe URL characters and using the standard %xx hex encoding of URLs for octets outside that range.\n\nSo IE is the only browser that follows the RFC ;)\n\nProbably you could include the encoding process into LESS compilation.\n\nPS: there is `decodeURIComponent` which makes the pain negligible ;)\n  Take a look here in the Google Chrome 40 on a large screen:\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs-demos/tabbar-labels.html\n\nWhat I see is only two tabbar icons out of 4. As I make the Chrome window narrower all the icons get into view.\n\nI do not know if it is the same bug but I included\n\n```\n.view {\n  max-width: 768px;\n  margin-left: auto;\n  margin-right: auto;\n}\n```\n\ninto my CSS. When the page gets wider than 768px the tabbar icon position is broken - I can never see the last icon. As soon as the screen size gets under the 768px all is fine.\n Perfect.

I'll see about recording a demo for you, too.\n Might it make sense for `var distance` to be:\n\n`app.params.fastClicksDistanceThreshold * app.device.pixelRatio`\n\nSince the fastClicks distance is measured in literal pixels, multiplying it by the device pixel ratio will result in a real world translation for the device, rather than what might end up a minuscule number.\n\nTake for example the iPhone 6 Plus with a ratio of `3`. A `20` pixel `fastClicksDistanceThreshold` is still a relatively small margin of touch error.\n fastClicksDistanceThreshold was set to 10 by default. Anyway, this issue can be fixed by playing with this value. Closing for now\n  Hi, I find that bug on v0.10.0. Just as http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs-demos/tabbar-badges.html\n  trying to help to solve it couldn't find the reason\n\n2) is there a way to steal the zooming capabalities from photo browser to swiper?\n  hello framework7 team\ni want contribute for translation  framework7 home site to my own language \nhow i can contirbute for this purpose?please guid me\n ok thanks\n  hello guys,you are amazing team thanks for support right-to-left user interface layout\ni found this framework i think its first time one and only framework support right-to-left layout\n  With cordova on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus, when you manipulate the DOM sometimes there is a flash where the content disappears for a split second.\n\nAfter some investigation, this is most likely caused by the many translate3d's that are used everywhere. This puts a lot of pressure on the GPU (mostly unnecessarily). This means the GPU must page memory, and when its in a reflow state, it must calculating the z-index with all the 3d transforms.\n\nI experimented with using different background colors to see what color the flash is. This showed that the page-content is disappearing for the split second while its calculating.\n\nThis isn't an issue in the browser as computers have a lot more GPU memory.\n\nHas anyone else seen this?\n I see it on webapp\n I added a cordova project framework7-mvc-demo that is heavy enough to see the flashes.\n\nLet me know if I added it correctly, its my first time adding something to github like this.\n Ok. I saw the flashes on iphone 6 and 6 plus. I don't have others to test on.\n\nThanks glad you liked it. Was only playing around with stuff, not doing anything with this, I have a huge app about 50% done that I will put in your showcase when done.\n\nWith this demo app, i also sometimes see the nav bar have the menu button and back button overlapping but i have never seen it in my other app. I figure thats just something I messed up.\n @nolimits4web Did you see the flashing that I mentioned?\n Sounds good. Great job finding it. I couldn't. Let me know when you fixed it all. \n Ok, been moving, will test this weekend. Thanks again. \n Its still happening :(\n\nEven in my demo app that I posted.\n Sure, just need to figure out how to record my iPhone screen. Doesn't happen in the emulator or through a web browser.\n Ok will do \n Can confirm the transitions are much smoother now. I never saw literal flashing of content, but it was quite jittery. In 1.0.2 it's buttery smooth. \n I found more details into this problem.\n\nI no longer see the flashes when its web only, but in cordova I still see them.\n\nHere are the details (iOS only so far):\n\nWhen you have a page that doesn't have enough content to make it scroll, but have an accordion that expands enough to then make it scroll, then you close that accordion (the webUI goes from overflow scrolling to removing overflow scrolling) this is what causes the flashes that i see.\n\nXCode also produces an error on occasion.\n\n```\nWebKit discarded an uncaught exception in the webView:willRemoveScrollingLayer:withContentsLayer:forNode: delegate: <NSInvalidArgumentException> -[WebActionDisablingCALayerDelegate \n```\n\nThe fixes I have found so far (but not good enough).\n1) remove -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch\nbut this creates an ugly app without the overflow scrolling.\n\n2) make all pages have enough content to always be in the overflow space\nbut this is often impossible with dynamic content\n\n@nolimits4web I was wondering if you could make all .page or .page-content whichever it is always have overflow scrolling? Maybe by making the height 101%? I tried to do this, but couldn't get the idea to work.\n\nIf you could help me that would be great, as those flashes are very distracting.\n I have the same problem,how do you resolve?@MarcGodard\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/88951/6014135/614b8a22-ab24-11e4-8bc8-4c92af9d1876.jpg)\n\nAttached screenshot shows how in iOS 8 on the iPhone 6+, the status bar is made completely hidden. I could not find documentation to force it, either. It appears quite common, as even native apps hide the status bar. I'm attaching the weather app below as an example:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/88951/6014176/f4b41b12-ab24-11e4-85c2-3e0e84c0cc06.jpg)\n Thanks @nolimits4web. Ended up doing something like:\n\n```\n\nfunction my_app_statusbar_toggle() {\n    if ( My_App.device.statusBar && Mp_App.device.iphone ) {\n        switch( window.orientation ) {\n            case -90 :\n            case 90 :\n                if ( window.innerWidth >= 736 ) {\n                    $$( 'html' ).removeClass( 'with-statusbar-overlay' );\n                }\n                break;\n            default :\n                if ( window.innerWidth >= 414 ) {\n                    $$( 'html' ).addClass( 'with-statusbar-overlay' );\n                }\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nwindow.addEventListener( 'orientationchange', function() {\n    my_app_statusbar_toggle();\n} );\n\nwindow.addEventListener( 'load', function() {\n    my_app_statusbar_toggle();\n} );\n```\n\nThis way it doesn't collide with other iPhones and iPads. I'd considered checking `device.pixelRatio` but it seemed like a temporary hack.\n    Pull to refresh is very sensitive because it is triggered when the page is pull down for 44 pixel. This patch increases the pull distance to 1/5 of the screen.\n    Implemented very common tap navbar to scroll to top of page.\n\nMaybe we should add a param to turn this on and off, but many many apps\nhave it.\n Awesome, thanks, will make those changes after the weekend.\n Awesome. Thanks. Been busy with some work lately. \n  It now automatically adds bottom padding on pageContent when the picker\nis close to the bottom.\n\nWill eventually make a picker keyboard. Maybe.\n I noticed... I also saw you added it to calendar... i was about to do that.\n  Slider loop does not play nicely with e.g. forms, knockout data-bind etc. As soon as you start duplicating slides you start to create difficult to find errors ;). I would rather have an other form of animation for the loop that does not require duplicating the slides. Is that possible? As it is now the loop feature is unusable and very risky. I spent one day finding out why knockout data-binding behaves completely randomly...\n  `framework7.min.css` is not minified neither in the `custom` task nor in the `dist` task.\n\n`framework7.min.js` is ok.\n\nEDIT: I mean when building using Grunt\n It's fine in the repo, I'm just building it on my side, so it could be an issue on my system. Will double check, although I'm doing exactly the steps as in the README.\n Works fine, if I downgrade the grunt-contrib-less version to `^0.12.0`. Both `grunt dist`and `grunt custom` targets now produce minified `framework7.custom.min.css` files. \n\nI think to simulate this issue you need to delete `node_modules/grunt-contrib-less` and run `npm update`again or simply build a fresh clone of the project.\n  Is there some reason that height() and width() include padding? I'm just curious since jQuery's method do not and it tripped me up a little bit.\n  Not sure if I'm doing this right but when I have an onPageBack callback I was expecting the context property to persist as when in the onPageInit callback.\n\nAn example:\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.onPageInit('page-1', function (page) {\n        console.log(page.context);  // Object exists\n});\n```\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.onPageBack('page-1', function (page) {\n        console.log(page.context);  // undefined\n});\n```\n No, but I did today and it works. I have previously used v0.10.\nThank you!\n  in `position: absolute` mode, \n\n``` css\n.sortable-handler {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    height: ~\"-webkit-calc(100% - 1px)\";\n    height: ~\"calc(100% - 1px)\";\n}\n```\n\nis equivalent to\n\n``` css\n.sortable-handler {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    bottom: 1px;\n}\n```\n\nand can produce better compatibility\n  Smart Select automatically sets div.item-after to be the selected option. But there is another use case missing that is to set selected option based on a value. This change is to implement the missing use case. \n\nAdding a value to div.item-after and also add a new class smart-select-value to it will set the select option which matches the value to be selected.\n  I tried many ways to not include this in the library, but it must be.\n\nThe _system target is original enough and should only ever be used for cordova apps.\n This is ready to merge :)\n  For the app I'm making, when the user first enters the app, the default home page is loaded (let's call it `index.html`). After the user signs in, they are routed to another page of the app (let's call this `feed.html`).\n\nWhen the user leaves the app and decides to come back later, but is still logged into the app, I want the user to automatically see `feed.html` when the app loads, rather than `index.html`. I use `localStorage` to keep track of whether or not the user is logged in. My problem is trying to get `feed.html` to load instead of `index.html`. I have tried passing a `url` parameter when adding the main view to the app, though it does not seem to redirect the page.\n\nIs there any way I can do this? I have tried changing the default url dynamically and in the html as indicated [here](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/views.html#default-view-url), but `index.html` keeps loading instead of `feed.html`.\n\nThis is the code I was using:\n\n``` js\nvar mainView;\nif (localStorage.getItem(\"isLoggedIn\") !== null){\n    // If already logged in\n    mainView = myApp.addView(\".view-main\", {\n        url: \"feed.html\"\n    });\n}\nelse {\n    mainView = myApp.addView(\".view-main\", {});\n}\n```\n\nBefore this, I would forward the user to `feed.html` after `index.html` loads using the router:\n\n``` js\nmainView.router.load({\n    url: \"feed.html\"\n});\n```\n\nbut I would rather have the user land on `feed.html` instead of `index.html` if possible, since UX-wise, it would seem odd if the user is logged in, yet has to see the original screen where they originally logged in.\n\nThanks in advance.\n mainView.router.load({\n    url: \"feed.html\",\n reload: true\n});\n  The alignment of the \":\" seems off. Its too close to the last number (the minutes)\n\n![screen shot 2015-01-21 at 2 14 19 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5843068/dfd1a554-a177-11e4-8156-41158650c028.png)\n Yes it was chrome Iphone emulator. I will check more soon.\n  The current implementation in _js/dom7-ajax.js_ assumes that a server would always return a valid json to be parsed when the request completes. [This line](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/dom7-ajax.js#L204), however, would break if that is not the case. For example, it would throw a [SyntaxError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Exceptions), if the response is `200 OK` and there is no data, i.e., `responseData` is an empty string.\n\nNow, I know this really is a problem of the faulty server (my faulty server in this case) and not the F7 lib, but I just wondered whether this should be handled more robustly. For example, at least check if `responseData` is an empty string and return `null` on `options.success`? An app can then make further verifications or present an error to the user.\n :+1:  Works fine, error event is dispatched.\n Is this actually resolved? When I look at the latest code, the fix is not in there.\nThe problem seems to be this commit: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/6fe9a6864980af35898c633d780ca6281fcf8ed5/src/js/dom7-ajax.js\n\nIn the commit right before the one above, the fix is still there:\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/daf8743773770ba8b401581bf29f0ae0f05c6495/src/js/dom7-ajax.js\n\nDid it accidentally get lost by merging or something like that?\n  **tl;dr;** Add a boolean `force` parameter to re-trigger the `show` event in case the tab is already active.\n\n---\n\nNot exactly a bug but I wanted to propose to add a force parameter to this function. Here's my case in point.\n\nSuppose we have a specific functionality that should happen right after a tab is shown. To capsulate this one would use:\n\n``` javascript\n    $$('.mytab-1').on('show', function () {\n                // some sort of very specific calls\n        ajaxLoad(data);\n                showData(element);\n    }); \n```\n\nNow, we would like this to be executed every time the user makes modifications on another page and goes back to the page where the tabs are:\n\n``` javascript\n    myApp.onPageBack('config-page', function(page) {\n                // Some other code ..\n        myApp.showTab('.tabs.mytab-1');\n    }); \n```\n\nNow this won't work because that tab is already `.active`, therefore one cannot trigger the  `show` event again. \n :+1: \n\nAh, dang it. My workaround was:\n\n``` javascript\n$('.tabs.mytab-1').removeClass('active');\nmyApp.showTab('.tabs.mytab-1');\n```\n\n:)\n\nThe force param is nice to have but no biggie.\n  Do you think we could work on adding a frosted glass effect?\n\nhttp://ionicframework.com/demos/frosted-glass/\n Ok, I understand it is very complicated and difficult for very little return\n  I was wondering if you can easily add tabs as a sub header. I have seen this on my iPhone and I like it. I can't seem to find it right now to take a screen shot.\n ![img_0247](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5838380/1a9846e8-a155-11e4-9d4a-c35e08305172.PNG)\n Awesome! I was also quite interested in this having made a workaround earlier. Will test it asap.\n Awesome... Very fast too.\n\nHowever, not working with themes!\n\n![screen shot 2015-01-21 at 2 07 14 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5842938/e5b50b2e-a176-11e4-8070-7dd7c5696823.png)\n  I am having an issue where I need to unfocus and refocus an input element (its a keyboard cursor fix on iOS after a JavaScript scroll while input is focused).\n\nThe trick is after the scroll is done, you unfocus and refocus the input immediately.\n\nThis has worked on many other platforms and in other places that I have done this. But for some reason this is slow using this framework, which makes the keyboard jump down a bit before the refocus.\n\n``` JavaScript\n$(activeInput).blur();\n$(activeInput).focus();\n```\n\nIs there something in the framework code (like other events on the inputs or a delay) that would prevent the following lines of code to have a delay between them?\n Already tried without the DOM.\n\nAlso tried where I add an event (on blur trigger refocus) to see if it would run faster, and no.\n\nWhen I removed fastclick, it didn't fix it, but it caused other issues, like I couldn't unfocus by clicking off the input.\n\nFor the messages, when someone clicks on the send button, I have it refocusing on the textarea and the keyboard doesn't bounce.\n\nI will keep investigating and will keep this thread updated. Strange that if work on click for the messagebar.\n Thanks about the message bar.\n\nThe other issue (the cursor position fix) could also be fixed like this:\n\n``` javascript\n$(aE).val('.');\n$(aE).val('');\n```\n\nIt works great, thanks again for your help.\n  Instead of losing the screen when the keyboard opens, sometimes you\nwant to move the content of the page.\n\nThis allows you to use a plugin to do so by allowing you to specify the\ncurrent keyboard height.\n\nAlso, initial padding can now be different (like if you modify the\nmessage bar).\n Done.\n  make the touch move event function like a click event to prevent\nscrolling through the overlay\n  Used with the infinite top scrolling this can load images from the top\nof the messages.\n\nCan also change the method if using a different library or can create a custom one.\n\n![infinittop](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5770856/73f12d26-9d00-11e4-8ada-8271522c791d.gif)\n Very Nice.\n The only problem I see is that people will need to add and remove the class new-messages-first depending on if infinite scrolling is loading more or if they are typing and adding a new message on the bottom.\n Maybe, let me implement it and I will see.\n  This allows you to change what you want to search in on the fly.\n\n![searchchange](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5770815/70cf77de-9cff-11e4-87cf-73fa4653289e.gif)\n  After you scroll to the bottom of a page, initiate the listener for the\nevent, when you scroll up to the top, load more content. This is best\nto go with the messaging portion of F7.\n ![infinittop](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5770737/9041b3fe-9cfd-11e4-966b-aca069fdc909.gif)\n  ``` JavaScript\n    var mainView = f7.addView('.view-main', {\n        dynamicNavbar: false,\n        domCache: true\n    });\n```\n\nI get the following error:\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'find' of undefined\n\nWith line 539 of router.js:\n\n``` JavaScript\nnewNavbarInner.find('.sliding, .sliding .back .icon').transform('');\n```\n\nWhen I switch dynamicNavbar to true it works fine.\n Maybe its a combination with something else i am doing. I am going to close this for now.\n  Hi I added a check for a different search-in option\n\nline 89 of searchbar.js I simply added\n\n``` Javascript\n            searchIn = searchbar.attr('data-search-in');\n```\n\nThis way I can change the data-search-in attribute on the fly\n\nWorks well.\n\nI really wish the search worked more like native does (under the scroll with a snap, and when you focus the navbar disappears).\n\nI might work on it if you are not planing on it.\n #354 \n Yes I noticed that too. Maybe in a future release!\n   Thanks for your contribution !!\nI\u2019m loving it so much ! :+1: \n\nHere is my suggest .\nIs that can be encoded by utf-8 for all file  in the dist folder ? \nYes, I can do it myself . \nBut not friendly for other user , especially, the Chinese users or Japanese users. Is not good for popularize I think .\n\nThanks again !\n\n---\n\nSorry for my English~  :smile: \n    My app uses cached pages and non-cached depending on the need.\n\nThis seems to work amazingly until you go from a cached page to a non cached page.\n\nFor some reason the cached class goes onto the non-cashed page and the page loads as if it was cached.\n\nThis seemed to be working before, so I am not sure what changed. I did pull the recent changes to master recently, but it might also be something I did. Will investigate.\n So If I go, cached page to non-cached then hit the back button, then go back to the same non-cached page, it acts as it was cached (because its still loaded for the back button). Then it breaks all my non-cached pages.\n Doing the reInit seems to work.\n I spoke too soon.\n\nWhen I go from one page call it \"profile\" that initializes with a query of id=1, then from that page I go to another profile with id=5, the pageBeforeInit and pageReinit doesn't fire.\n\nWith the profile page as non-cached.\n Actually pageBeforeInit does fire... something else is broken... :(\n ![screen shot 2015-01-08 at 3 22 06 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5669973/26339490-974a-11e4-88db-9c08667a5747.png)\n\nThis is what happens, and now my init function doens't know which profile page to populate.\n I decided to use page.container and page.navbarInnerContainer instead of my own IDs. Works great... now I just need to apply it everywhere.\n Hahaha, sorry for continuing this issue and reopening it.\n\nSo everything works great except for the message stuff.\n\nWhen there are 2 or more pages with the messages part of the framework, the myApp.addMessage(parameters) stuff doesn't know where to put the new message.\n\nCan we pass it another parameter with the page.container?\n\nI can do this and make it a pull request if you want, but you might be able to do it faster.\n Awesome, thanks!\n ``` JavaScript\n    messagesContent = messagesContent || $('.messages-content');\n```\n\nDoesn't that make better sense?\n\nSo you can do this...\n\n``` JavaScript\n    myApp.f7.addMessage({\n      text: message.text,\n      type: message.type,\n      name: message.name,\n      day: day\n    }, $(page.container).find('.messages-content'));\n```\n Ahh, thats great, thanks.\n  Has anyone done anything to disable the panels. As in before you login there are no menus, then once you login there it is?\n I found that I can do this:\n\n``` JavaScript\nf7.allowPanelOpen = false;\n```\n\nIs there a reason this isn't documented? Are there problems with it? Is it incomplete. Seems to work and can be switched on and off.\n Thanks,\n\nAlso the allowPanelOpen = false disables swipe to open too.\n  Hi I was trying to do an external link for cordova wiht the inAppBrowser plugin. Which if you add target=\"_system\" should open in a new browser window.\n\nF7 seems to capture this and not allow the link to work.\n\nI made some changes, not worth a pull request.\n\n``` JavaScript\n        var external = clicked.attr('target') === '_system';\n        if (external) {\n            window.open(url, '_system', 'location=yes');\n            e.preventDefault();\n            return;\n        }\n```\n\non line 11 of clicks.js\n\nYou can also connect it with the external parameter if you want, but you can use these differently as just adding the external class will not work for cordova.\n didn't work. It would open it in the app itself as if _system was not the target. Didn't investigate why, cause my solution worked.\n So I tried a million things to get this to work without impacting Framework7 code. Its not possible.\n\nI have gotten it to open in an external browser, but then it also opens in the app. These changes shouldn't impact anything new.\n\n#366\n   the problem is when I put 'heavy' code in onSlideChangeStart its make the transition laggy\n really love swiper with 3D Flow plugin sound great :)\n\nabout the slider I think we missing normal event like onSlideNext onSlidePrev\n you didnt understand me :)\nthe direction less concern me, the solution to the bug I reported is that the slider is missing basic event to know when slideChanged. we dont have any way right now as - onSlideChangeEnd not called on fast sliding and onSlideChangeStart make the slide laggy.\nso the solution is to have simple events just like swiper that dont belongs to transition or touch or anything.\n that fire when activeSlideIndex is changing no matter how if by touch or by button\n oh now i got you \n  open kitchen sink, turn off internet, try to move between pages throws 'net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED' in console and page not loading.\n yes my mistake sorry, I test it by running the 'grunt server' command.\nin phonegap its working fine\n  Add device pixel ratio class to body.\n Good call @nolimits4web. I agree. \n  Hi @nolimits4web \n\nI created a lazy loader in the framework on my testing branch. There are many other things that I am playing with in that branch so I am not doing a pull request just yet. Just thought I would let you know if you wanted to check it out.\n\nJust so you are aware, all the work I am doing is for use as cordova framework, so it relies on the webkit web UI available JS version and is not backwards compatible.\n\nThe lazy loading is important for mobile apps, so I thought you might want to consider adding it. If you do a diff, you will see many other small changes here and there (I also just pulled from your master branch).\n\nI am planing on working a lot on this framework and expanding on it, if you would like to discuss some of my ideas, let me know.\n\nIf you want to work together that would be great, if not, I will just start my own project based on yours and give you the credit where due.\n\nLet me know,\n\nMarc\n I was thinking about that, but to me it made more sense for it to be part of the framework. You don't typically need many images if any in modals, popovers, popups and panels. If you do need them there, there is no point in lazy loading them as there typically isn't a scroll or much of one.\n\nI have also started implementing Material Design look for android and created a bunch of plugins to easily add cordova plugins.\n\nI have also been looking into adding node CLI stuff like ionic has. I think you have a much better base and start than ionic did and would like to see this framework go that far.\n\nIf your long term plans do not line up, maybe we can split off and still contribute to each others projects.\n\nMy long term goals are the following:\n- Easy CLI for cordova and cordova plugins (like Ionic has)\n- Automatically looks like Android (Material Design) when building for android.\n- Very simple MVC base that people can start with or not. Some start projects (again like Ionic)\n- Easy plugins and framework support (like ngCordova) to add keyboard, camera, geolocation, localization, or other things really easily.\n\nI also want to come up with a new name for such a project, as googling the word 'framework' brings about many other things and it really had to develop a community without good google help.\n Awesome. Nice work. I took a look at it.\n  var myApp = new Framework7({\n    // Hide and show indicator during ajax requests\n    onAjaxStart: function (xhr) {\n        myApp.showIndicator();\n    },\n    onAjaxComplete: function (xhr) {\n        myApp.hideIndicator();\n    }\n}); \n\nThe indicator stills not shows up while post request but works on get request.\n\n$$('.confirm').on('click', function (e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n            // post request here\n            myApp.alert(\"complete\uff01\");\n            mainView.back();\n\n```\n});\n```\n I tried it, just not working.....\n Sorry I cant, my code runs on android. In webview it looks fine!\n  Is there a way to pass a query with the inline page urls?\n\n``` html\n<a href=\"#profile?id=345634\">Go to a Profile page</a>\n```\n\nI haven't tried the following, but if you know it will work (or something similar), please let me know.\n\n``` javascript\nmainView.router.load({pageName: 'about', query:{id: 342523}});\n```\n\nIf neither of these work, I guess this would be a feature request?\n  pageAfterBack doesn't seem to be triggered on ios 8.1 on an iPhone6 plus.\n\nWill investigate... but if anyone has an idea if this is intentional, please let me know.\n I understand that. It fires fine in the browser, just not with cordova on ios.\n My bad... I had a race condition and my code wouldn't run cause the page wasn't reloaded yet. My apologies.\n  Hello, is it possible to add a confirmation button (something like \"OK\") in the bottom of smart-select options list? I think it will be more convenient than use \"Back\" button on top panel.\n  I'm using the FromJSON function to restore form data from JSON.\nMy app has custom radio buttons (ala Bootstrap).\nThe original radio button is hidden, and the 'button-like' style is displayed.\n\nIs there a possibility to set the 'active' class on each of the parent label of the radiobutton when using FromJSON?\n  The switch does not work on Android.\nIt works fine in the browser and iOS.\n It doesn't show on Android 4.2-\n I use PNG to replace.\n  Continue of [#322](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/322) \nNow it breaks with animatePages: false\nupdated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Sl1v3r/h6ycoyps/\n\nPS: This fiddle throws Uncaught TypeError, it seems to be another bug, just run it few times and when it is loaded without errors, randomly click digits like you did before.\n Updated commit to not break other stuff\n   yes.. take a look at the docs under 'Navigation / Router'\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/router-api.html#.VJBh3TGsXYQ\n  Added an option that the ionic keyboard cordova plugin is installed, which when using the message bar will add the correct space below the messages, scroll to position, and then open the keyboard with the message bar on top.\n Sorry wanted to do this from a clean brach, but my git skills are new.\n Sounds good. I think the keyboard one could be improved more.\n  Before and after screenshots below.\n\nHairlines are more consistent throughout and also now visible in the browser (chrome when you set iPhone6 plus emulation).\n\nTODO: Figure out how to improve hairlines for input boxes (messagebar and prompt) without impacting style or performance.\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-14 at 11 14 16 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5428017/8ad7b1d2-8382-11e4-891b-4de2d132bc5b.png)\n![screen shot 2014-12-14 at 11 15 12 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5428016/8ad73572-8382-11e4-9a45-be78d4bfdc13.png)\n\n![ios simulator screen shot dec 14 2014 11 09 35 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5427967/128566f2-8382-11e4-9aa3-060c9b378d73.png)\n![ios simulator screen shot dec 14 2014 11 04 02 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5427968/128a185a-8382-11e4-98d4-6341d3dacba4.png)\n![ios simulator screen shot dec 14 2014 11 09 45 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5427969/128d7284-8382-11e4-8af5-8f6f3940dbd9.png)\n![ios simulator screen shot dec 14 2014 11 05 03 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5016637/5427970/12918126-8382-11e4-9ad2-b20d98357e56.png)\n I noticed the screenshots are a little mixed up. Just take note that the ones where the hairlines are consistent are the new ones.\n This is completely fixed, sorry for the many updates, this is my first time contributing.\n\nThis is ready to merge.\n @nolimits4web Just wondering if you had looked at this yet?\n\nI think its good work, but maybe you can improve it.\n\nAlso, side note, I added (again in my testing branch) an infinite scroll for the top of the page. This is mostly for the messaging so you can load more (older) messages.\n\nThe only issue is you cannot set the event listener until after the messages are loaded, if not it loads more on top and scroll from the bottom of the messages.\n Confirming this is an issue on the iPhone 6+. `0.5px` gets scaled down to `0` as `1/3` is less than `1/2`. Clever approach, though it seems to only work for top & bottom borders, not left & right. This is less than ideal, and leaves me wondering if there's another, more comprehensive approach.\n Hey @nolimits4web! Here's how I've circumvented it for now: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/8ed43b470f79fddb02eeafbaf52adb071fafd2a1 Unsure why the tests are failing.\n\nThen in all the LESS files, instead of targeting `.retina` target `.pixel-ratio-2`. In my experience, a `1px` border on the iPhone 6+ isn't horrible, thanks to the immense amount of pixels and the overall scaling that takes place to fit everything.\n I agree that my approach adds complications. As far as left and right borders, I agree, this is still a problem.\n\nThe benefits of this approach is that it will be visible on all devices and browsers as scaling down cannot go to 0 and will go to the smallest visible line.\n\n@johnjamesjacoby I prefer the lines to be one visible pixel (3px in css). The thicker lines don't look as nice on the iphone 6 plus.\n Yes. It doesn't appear to work for me. Anything up to `0.9px` still had the same rounding-down effect of being invisible.\n @nolimits4web When I look at the changed files for this pull request, all the correct changes are there. There shouldn't be anything about the lazy load.\n\nThese changes were done on my master branch as I didn't quite know what i was doing when i started contributing.\n\nI played around with 0.33 scaling and it also works well, tested on iPhone 6plus, and retina iPad mini.\n  Hello there!\n\nIt's about SmartList to be able to do a media-list kind of view with all the options.\nThe option could be up to:\n`<option value=\"value\" data-option-description=\"\"  data-option-subtitle=\"\" data-option-aftericon=\"\" data-option-image=\"\">Some Text</option>`\n\nOn the JS:\n\n```\nvar option, optionHasMedia, optionImageSmall, optionImage, optionIcon, optionDescription, optionSubtitle, optionAfterIcon, optionGroup, optionGroupLabel, optionPreviousGroup, optionShowGroupLabel, previousGroup;\n            for (var i = 0; i < select.length; i++) {\n                option = $(select[i]);\n                if (option[0].disabled) continue;\n                optionImageSmall = option.attr('data-option-image-small') || $select.attr('data-option-image-small');\n                optionImage = option.attr('data-option-image') || $select.attr('data-option-image');\n                optionIcon = option.attr('data-option-icon') || $select.attr('data-option-icon');\n                optionDescription = option.attr('data-option-description') || $select.attr('data-option-description');\n                optionSubtitle = option.attr('data-option-subtitle') || $select.attr('data-option-subtitle');\n                optionAfterIcon = option.attr('data-option-aftericon') || $select.attr('data-option-aftericon');\n                optionHasMedia = optionImage || optionIcon || inputType === 'checkbox';\n                optionGroup = option.parent('optgroup')[0];\n                optionGroupLabel = optionGroup && optionGroup.label;\n                optionShowGroupLabel = false;\n                if (optionGroup) {\n                    if (optionGroup !== previousGroup) {\n                        optionShowGroupLabel = true;\n                        previousGroup = optionGroup;\n                    }\n                }\n                values.push({\n                    value: option[0].value,\n                    text: option[0].textContent.trim(),\n                    selected: option[0].selected,\n                    group: optionGroup,\n                    groupLabel: optionGroupLabel,\n                    showGroupLabel: optionShowGroupLabel,\n                    imageSmall: optionImageSmall,\n                    image: optionImage,\n                    icon: optionIcon,\n                    description: optionDescription,\n                    subtitle: optionSubtitle,\n                    afterIcon: optionAfterIcon,\n                    disabled: option[0].disabled,\n                    inputType: inputType,\n                    id: id,\n                    hasMedia: optionHasMedia,\n                    checkbox: inputType === 'checkbox',\n                    inputName: inputName,\n                    test: this\n                });\n            }\n\n\n            // Item template/HTML\n            if (!app._compiledTemplates.smartSelectItem) {\n                app._compiledTemplates.smartSelectItem = t7.compile(app.params.smartSelectItemTemplate ||\n                    '{{#if showGroupLabel}}' +\n                    '<li class=\"item-divider\">{{groupLabel}}</li>' +\n                    '{{/if}}' +\n                    '<li>' +\n                    '<label class=\"label-{{inputType}} item-content\">' +\n                    '<input type=\"{{inputType}}\" name=\"{{inputName}}\" value=\"{{value}}\" {{#if selected}}checked{{/if}}>' +\n                    '{{#if hasMedia}}' +\n                    '<div class=\"item-media\">' +\n                    '{{#if checkbox}}<i class=\"icon icon-form-checkbox\"></i>{{/if}}' +\n                    '{{#if icon}}<i class=\"icon {{icon}}\"></i>{{/if}}' +\n                    '{{#if image}}<img src=\"{{image}}\" width=\"90\">{{/if}}' +\n                    '{{#if imageSmall}}<img src=\"{{imageSmall}}\" width=\"40\">{{/if}}' +\n                    '</div>' +\n                    '{{/if}}' +\n                    '<div class=\"item-inner\">' +\n                        '<div class=\"item-title-row\">' +\n                            '{{#if text}}<div class=\"item-title\">{{text}}</div>{{/if}}' +\n                            '{{#if afterIcon}}<div class=\"item-after\"><img src=\"{{afterIcon}}\" width=\"40\"/></div>{{/if}}' +\n                        '</div>' +\n                        '{{#if subtitle}}<div class=\"item-subtitle\">{{subtitle}}</div>{{/if}}' +\n                        '{{#if description}}<div class=\"item-text\">{{description}}</div>{{/if}}' +\n                    '</div>' +\n                    '</label>' +\n                    '</li>'\n                );\n            }\n```\n\nand\n\n`var pageHTML =\n                (navbarLayout === 'through' ?

I have read over the open items and docs and for the life of me cannont get this to work. \n\nI am ( obviously ) using an android phone, have put an event listener on the back button to call \n\nmyapp.goBack()\nmainView.goBack()\n\nThese two produce a JS error \n\n   Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'goBack'\n\nI have tried with without it being a method call, then it does nothing. I have tried adding \n\npushState to true and uniqueHistory to true but still it does not work with the back button.\n\nI also tried to add regular 'history.back(-1)' and other JS back code but still nothing.. \n\nAm I doing something wrong? I am doing testing on the OOTB lib right now, just downloaded it yesterday so it should be up to date.\n\nThanks!\n Ok, I'll try that out. I searched the forum but did not see the actual code\nmentioned.\n\nThanks\nOn Dec 10, 2014 12:34 PM, \"Vladimir Kharlampidi\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> It should be mainView.router.back(), also check the forum, there were a\n> lot of solutions for this\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/327#issuecomment-66519149\n> .\n @nolimits4web This works perfectly now!\n\nThanks!\n  Dom7 function .text(\"\") affect only for first element. Same function in jQuery works for all elements from selection. \n  Hi, I can't seem to find the code that is causing blur from inputs to not happen when you click off of the input. I really need it to be able to click off.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nAlso, I was wondering how I contribute to this project? I am working on a nice little addon for when people have an ionic keyboard plugin installed (with phonegap or cordova). This plugin will automatically add the right amount of padding to the bottom and scroll. Also will work a little differently with the messagebar. If this has been done let me know where i can find it.\n I forked the project. I have been working in the actual js files and I am also improving the way you're doing retina display. I have never done this with Github yet, so haven't added the changes to git hub yet, need to do some learning. If you want, I will notify you when they are done. So far I have successfully and cleanly got the keyboard (with ionic keyboard plugin) and messagebar working together beautifully without resizing the view port (Only tested iOS7 and iOS8). Next will be other inputs, followed by improved retina stuff. (On my iPhone 6 plus the 0.5px looks terrible).\n There is a better solution that I have tested on the iPhone 5, iPhone 6, and 6+ that works very well.\n\nhttp://atirip.com/2013/09/22/yes-we-can-do-fraction-of-a-pixel/\n\nthe iPhone 6 plus is @3 so 0.5px is actually 1.5px on the screen and because things are rounded to the nearest pixel, it becomes 1px or 2px which is the problem, 1 is too thin and 2 mixed with it (especially on the popups) looks terrible.\n\nUsing the solution (link) cause the webUI to calculate the best line every time.\n\nI will be implementing it in my fork of this project, however, not for a few weeks if you want to do it before me.\n I agree it is more complicated, but the results are amazingly better and more consistent.\n Also, that link does not use backgrounds, they use a scale, which is a lot easier to deal with. And a lot easier for custom styles. All you do is treat the device size 2X bigger and scale everything 50%. This also looks a lot nicer on the iPhone5 (more native looking) and iPads.\n This is what I did and it worked so far (not done testing). This doesn't impact performance, nor styling, yet adds hairlines. The best part is that they stay visible in the browser as well, so it works everywhere.\n\nhtml.retina.ios-gt-7 .content-block-inner {\n    position:relative;\n    border-top-width: 0;\n    border-bottom-width: 0;\n}\nhtml.retina.ios-gt-7 .content-block-inner:before {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    border-top: 1px solid #c8c7cc;\n    transform: scaleY(0.5);\n    -webkit-transform: scaleY(0.5);\n    content: \"\";\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 1px;\n}\nhtml.retina.ios-gt-7 .content-block-inner:after {\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #c8c7cc;\n    transform: scaleY(0.5);\n    -webkit-transform: scaleY(0.5);\n    content: \"\";\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 1px;\n}\n oh, I think you have to add this too:\n- {\n  transform-origin: 0 0;\n  -webkit-transform-origin: 0 0;\n  }\n Ok, enjoy your vacations. if I am done doing it and testing, you can add my code (and teach me how to contribute more?)\n See pull request #329\n  scrollMessagesContainer function doesn't scroll Messages with static toolbar / navbar to the end, because of paddings\n Yeap, problem is still there.

Framework works fine, but the elements on the screen iPhone 6 / iPhone 6 Plus - very large. The status bar also is not optimized. What can come up with a solution? That all elements are displayed correctly. Thanks!\n I solved the problem. Just added Images.xcassets in Project, where i selected image to launch 5.5 Retina, now everything is fine.\n\nOn Phonegap , Yes. \n If you use the iOS Cordova version 3.7 it also fixes all these issues.\n  While scrolling, the header sticks but when I scroll all the way to the top, then stop until the content stops moving, and then scroll up the header goes down with the content. Same with bottom. I tested this on iphone 5s and 6 with kitchensink.\n\nThere is a neat CSS solution with -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;  (I see you are using it, but I think you need to do a little more work). Here is what I found: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ios-5-fixed-positioning-and-content-scrolling--mobile-8332\n\nCurrently I implemented iScroll 5 and seems to be working good, but CSS is solution over JS is always better.\n I disable disallowOverscoll in cordova\uff0cbut it doesn't work\n ``` javascript\n<preference name=\"DisallowOverscroll\" value=\"true\"/>\n```\n\nplus a keyboard plugin (such as ionic), plus \n\n``` javascript\ncordova.plugins.Keyboard.disableScroll(true);\n```\n  In many IM apps, it always  scrolls down to the bottom to show the latest message when we open the app to check message.\n\nHowever the default position of messages page in Framework7 is on the top.\n I found `myApp.scrollMessagesContainer(messagesContent)` , I can use it to do scroll down to the latest message. There should be an option to choose default position (top / bottom) in Messages.\n @nolimits4web Yes, you're right. Thanks!\n  I set the attribute checked=\"checked\" but it didn't work.\n My apologies, it was my bad. \n  I am trying to integrate google map into the page. Any clues?\n Hi, I have made it.\nPreviously I put this one:\n\n```\n        <div class=\"pages\">\n          <div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page\">\n            <div class=\"page-content\">\n            <div class=\"page-content\">\n                <div id=\"map-canvas\" class=\"map-canvas\"></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n```\n\nAfter modify, it works. Modification is:\n\n```\n        <div class=\"pages\">\n          <div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page\">\n            <div class=\"page-content\">\n                <div id=\"map-canvas\" class=\"map-canvas\"></div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n```\n\nI also use gmaps.js to make the integration simpler.\n\nThanks anyway.\n  Hello there!

I bind click event so it remove Item from localStorage, close panel-right, call app.loginSreen().\n\nFirst time it works, when you disconnect and reconnect, the disconnect button could not be fired any more.\n ```\nuser = JSON.parse(app.ls.getItem('user')) || {};\nif (!user.token) {\n    app.loginScreen();\n} else {\n    api.setAuthorization(user.token);\n    $$('.panel.panel-right').html(T7.templates.profile(user));\n}\n\n// Login screen overlay actions \n$$('.login-screen').find('.list-button').on('click', function () {\n    var username = $$('.login-screen').find('input[name=\"username\"]').val(),\n        password = $$('.login-screen').find('input[name=\"password\"]').val();\n\n    api.setAuthorization(username, password);\n    api.login(function (data) {\n        var user = JSON.parse(data);\n        localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));\n        $$('.panel.panel-right').html(T7.templates.profile(user));\n        app.closeModal('.login-screen');\n    });\n});\n\n// Disconnect\n$$('.disconnect-button').on('click', function () {\n    localStorage.removeItem('user');\n    app.closePanel('right');\n    app.loginScreen();\n});\n```\n yes\n thanks, it works \n  With jQuery, I can do this:\n\n```\nvar $container = jQuery('<div class=\"container\"></div>');\n```\n\nbut in Dom7, I can't do it like this:\n\n```\nvar $container = Dom7('<div class=\"container\"></div>');\n```\n  Currently, the DOM root for the Framework7 is the body tag \u2013 is it possible to wrap in in a container div?\n Rather than using an iframe (that doesn't preserve the URL of its page) I wanted to wrap the whole app into a .wrapper div.\nThe issue is the i.e. modals are still appended to the body.\n![Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28712/5141555/18558494-7177-11e4-8b67-385b7a0b9e7b.png)\n OK, thanks.

Is there any better way to do this ?\n  See:\nhttp://caniuse.com/#feat=classlist\n\nKnown issues: WebKit browsers (Safari, Android browser, but NOT Chrome) and IE do not have support for classList on SVG elements.\n\nI have a svg image which I drag using D3. While I try to drag it in IE11 I get an error in Framework7 because it tries to do classList stuff with the svg element.\n\nIs that intended behavior?\n Im assuming 2 years later this issue is resolved. Move to close?  Here I have multiple inline pages in one view, each page has its own navbar. \nWhen I navigate through the pages( page1 -> page 2 -> page3, then back to page2, back to page1, repeat, ...), I found I always would fail to pop back the navigation stack(when trying pop back from page2 -> page1).\n\nAnd I noticed there's a error in javascript console. \n\n>    Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'prev' of undefined    router.js:1001\n>    app.router.afterBack                                                                      router.js:1001\n>    afterAnimation                                                                               router.js:611\n>    (anonymous function)                                                                    router.js:630\n>    fireCallBack                                                                                   dom7-methods.js:230\n\nAnd the source code related to the error is something like below:\n\n>    if (newNavbar) {\n>                            previousNavbar = $(view.container).find('.navbar-inner[data-page=\"' + view.pagesCache[preloadUrl] + '\"]');\n>                            previousNavbar.insertBefore(newNavbar);\n>    }\n>    if(!previousNavbar || previousNavbar.length === 0) previousNavbar = newNavbar.prev('.navbar-inner.cached');\n\nHowever, the last line of snippets above might encounter error when newNavbar is null, which is the cause of my issue. Adding tests for newNavbar solves the problem.\n Sorry, it's a web app still being worked on. \nThe page structure is like below:\nTab Bar(Views)\n       Tab1(Pages)\n            Page1+Navbar+Content(link to Page2)\n            Page2+Navbar+Content(link to Page3)\n            Page3+Navbar+Content\n        Tab2(Pages)\n            Page4\n        Tab3(Pages)\n            Page5\n I've checked it in 0.10.0.

I think he is simply saying that the performance on android for scrolling on his note2 is bad.\n his mean about why android can't scroll like ios ,and because the framework not use iscroll\n  I observed when textarea at the bottom of the screen gain focus, keyboard overlay the textarea instead of pushing it up for the user to see what he's typing..\n\nAnyway to correct this issue.\n\nThanks in advance\n A new observation with this behavior.\n\nI did some research and got some people with the same problem focusing on Phonegap as the culprit, while very few accused JQM.\n\nBut i don't think that is the same with me here. When i tried the same Phonegap build with JQM 1.4 there was no issue. Then i reverted back to Framework7 but the issue persist. Then i viewed the app in Google Chrome browser on Android 4.4, still got the problem of keyboard overlay.\n\nThen i realized that, when the keyboard overlays and you hit \"spacebar key\" the Input field automatically comes up on the screen as it should have.\n\nSo am thinking if there's a way a script can be written, that looks out for input fields when focused and auto add \"spacebar key\" once. Probably it might work as a temporary solution.\n\nThanks in advance\n Would check that out. Thanks\n I finally solved the issue with a scrollTo jquery plugin..\nThanks for your suggestion about the keyboard plugin though.\n @tekkenking I have the same issue and can't solve it with scrollTo. Can you please provide fiddle or code of your solution?\n\nScripts:\n- Framework7 v1.4.2\n- jQuery.scrollTo v2.1.2\n Found other solution on internet using code:\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.onPageInit('index', function (page) {\n  // Fixes android keyboard overlay on bottom textarea even if textare is used on\n  // some other page, reason unknown. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/21316252 for\n  // more info.\n  document.body.style.height = window.outerHeight + 'px';\n  // ...rest of your code.\n});\n```\n  After 'grunt build' the build/index.html file references the min files, but the build/ folder only contains the regular files.\n\nline 10:     link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/framework7.min.css\"\nline 98:     script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/framework7.min.js\" ...\n\nPerhaps templates/index.jade should contain a variable? I would guess there's a standard solution but I've never used grunt so not sure what to try. (Of course it's trivial to fix by hand after the build, but still worth fixing the code at some point.)\n Same thing happens after \"gulp build\" as well and minified versions are not generated inside /build. Copying framework7.min.js and framework7.min.css to your /build/js and build/css folders from /dist folders fixes the /build for development, but not sure about the index.jade fix either.   \n  Is iOS swipe back functionality no longer available in iOS8 Safari?\n\nPopup:Is it possible to make Navigation inside the popup window with through navigation? Or may be it's easier instead of using pop up make the desired page to transition from the bottom. \n Swipe back: I tested it on iPhone 5s and 6 (iOS8.1). Swipe back works only when safari has no history (if you open new tab and go to kitchen sink for example). Also works when you save page to the home screen as a standalone website. In all other cases it doesn't work, unless you try to swipe almost from the edge (but this defeats the purpose).\n  update mainView.goBack() to mainView.router.back()\n  Hi Vlad,  I have found an error with accordions on android.

For the most part it is somewhat accessible. The photo browser has a few pieces that could be improved on when voiceover is active on an app. First is that swipe gestures completely stop when voiceover is active. I know when using other 3rd party gesture libs (hammerjs & quo) that the gesture is still recognized and actionable when using the accessible gesture (3 finger swipe). Is there any plan for supporting swipe in accessibility mode?\n Great, the photo browser works well with a few modifications. First, I tweaked the toolbar template to use aria-labels and a hidden span for the navigation labels. Second, I adjusted the caption on the photo template to pass the caption along on the image tag as well so when the user taps the image it reads out the caption instead of the image filename. I might suggest these be added into core since they are low impact and provide full coverage.\n Sorry for the late reply - didn't see your follow up.\n\nSo in short the idea would be to add caption property to the image object and then assign that the image element when the template is generated.\n\nYou can see how I implemented in an app with an override on the hook `onSlideChangeEnd` in lines 801-808 of https://github.com/codearachnid/com.chestercomix.reader/blob/master/www/js/app.js\n\n```\nif( activeSlide.find('.align-claw-to-this').attr('alt') == '' ){\n    var caption = response.comix[0].panels[ slider.activeSlideIndex ].caption;\n    activeSlide.find('.align-claw-to-this').attr('alt',  caption );\n}\n```\n  Good day.\nLooks like `$.requestAnimationFrame` is not in use anyhere in Framework7.\n  Switch on the tab bar example using mainView.loadPage () of the time, the tab bar into the global.\n Use the following example.\nToolbar in all views and the page will appear not hiding, and I need to be in the home page when is this switching effect, into the sub page after the hidden tools\n\n<!-- Tabs, now tabs wrapper is \"views\" -->\n\n<div class=\"views tabs toolbar-fixed\">\n  <!-- Tab 1 - View 1, active by default -->\n  <div id=\"tab1\" class=\"view tab active\">\n    <div class=\"navbar\">\n      <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n        <div class=\"center\">View 1</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pages navbar-fixed\">\n      <div data-page=\"home-1\" class=\"page\">\n        <div class=\"page-content\">\n          <div class=\"content-block\">\n            <p>This is view 1</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- Tab 2 - View 2 -->\n  <div id=\"tab2\" class=\"view tab\">\n    <div class=\"navbar\">\n      <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n        <div class=\"center\">View 2</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pages navbar-fixed\">\n      <div data-page=\"home-2\" class=\"page\">\n        <div class=\"page-content\">\n          <div class=\"content-block\">\n            <p>This is view 2</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- Tab 2 - View 3 -->\n  <div id=\"tab3\" class=\"view tab\">\n    <div class=\"navbar\">\n      <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n        <div class=\"center\">View 3</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pages navbar-fixed\">\n      <div data-page=\"home-3\" class=\"page\">\n        <div class=\"page-content\">\n          <div class=\"content-block\">\n            <p>This is view 3</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- Tab bar with tab links -->\n  <div class=\"toolbar tabbar\">\n    <div class=\"toolbar-inner\">\n      <a href=\"#tab1\" class=\"tab-link active\"><i class=\"icon demo-icon-1\"></i></a>\n      <a href=\"#tab2\" class=\"tab-link\"><i class=\"icon demo-icon-2\"></i></a>\n      <a href=\"#tab3\" class=\"tab-link\"><i class=\"icon demo-icon-3\"></i></a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n  Media-list images are not lazy loading, very affect performance.

However, all tabs with its contents are included in the same file in demo.\n\n I want to load content from an API with Ajax, and dynamically load it when I switch to that tab. Is it possible?\n @nolimits4web I haven't found the tab events before. Thank you! I'll give it a try.\n\nBtw, whether the content which is dynamically loaded will be cached or not? It is very important for user experience.\n @nolimits4web Tab events work fine. The only problem is when switching between tabs, the app is always requesting API again and again.\n\n```\n$$('#message-view').on('show', function () {\n    renderMsg();\n});\n```\n Maybe I need to implement a cache system for this purpose. Anyway, thank you for your patient, Vladimir. You've helped me a lot.\n  I think the docs are not enough for someone new to it,most of them are the module APIs, before I read the code,I dont even know F7 have some good, jquery-like APIs.and sometimes docs have a little misspelling words.we can help to improve.^_^\n Cool\n  Hi Vlad, I have checked the 0.9.7 kitchen sink, and the option to \"hide bars on page scroll\", doesn't seem to work.  Also i checked in the kitchen sink demo on your homepage and also it is not working there either...\n\nPlease check it when you have some time.\nThanks..\n Hi Vlad,  how are you?\nI checked this again, and now I can see this working in the kitchen sink demo of framework7, when viewing the homepage in android browser, but still, I am not able to make it work in my app.\n\nIn the docs it says to ad the class to the \ndiv class=\"page-content hide-bars-on-scroll\"\n\nSo I added it,  but it didn't work. Is there anything else I need to do? \n\nBy the way, I am using android 4.4.2 on lg g2 phone, so you know my setup.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that I have a gradient on the nav bar, maybe it's connected? \n\nThanks....\n Hi Vlad, thanks for getting back to me.\nI have uploaded the wip here:\n\nhttp://www.sh-original-media.com/Chopin%203/\n\nIt is going to be an application about Frederic Chopin, the piano composer...\n\nI put on the biography sections the hide bars on scroll, but they are not working, please check it out, and if you need anything else , just let me know. \n\nthanks :)\n Great Vlad, thanks for the information, i updated and it works! :)\n  WordPress has a javascript based heartbeat API which works really nicely for keep-alive style requests. Unfortunately it relies on jQuery, which makes me wish F7 had its own.\n\nIt's easy enough to do:\n\n```\n( function long_poll() {\n    setTimeout( function() {\n        $$.post(\n            ajax_url,\n            {},\n            function( response ) {\n\n                try {\n                    var json = JSON.parse( response ),\n                        data = json.data;\n                } catch( e ) {\n                    return;\n                }\n\n                if ( true === json.success ) {\n                    (...)\n                }\n\n                // Setup long polling\n                long_poll();\n            },\n            'json'\n        );\n    }, 15000 );\n} )();\n```\n\nBut that sucks for obvious reasons.\n\nClearly web sockets are the best solution for something like this, but since they're not as readily available, I think a lightweight heartbeat API would make a nice addition to F7.\n Nothing is wrong with it, but just like with lazy-loading, having an official API to attach those polls to on specific intervals would be a nice feature. And I know you could build it to be more performant more quickly than I likely could. :)\n Closing this out. If I dream up a better solution, I'll do a pull request.\n  if there is something like\n\n``` html\n<a class='button'><i class='icon icon-upload'></i></a>\n```\n\nthis will be really nice feature\n Works great! \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7QPNbBd.png)\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    <link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\"\r\n          rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n.button {\r\n    font-size: 24px; /* default for icons from google */ \r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n        <a class=\"button\" href=\"pages/knowledge.html\"><i class=\"material-icons\">local_library</i>Knowledge</a>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n  Hi Vlad, I have been working with the kitchen sink and learning it and also the f7 docs.  I have made some test, and added the animation option to the tabs in the kitchen sink project.  But when i do this, the content inside the tabs is not scrollable any more.  if i use the regular tabs without animation, than it is scrollable.\n\nthis is the code i have in the tabs page:\n\nIs this a bug or did I miss anything?\n\nThanks,\nShaul.\n I am not able to paste my code right, I am a bit new in pasting code in github and such, how am i supposed to do it?\n\nthanks...\n That's great, Vlad.  Thank you very much :)\n If you're like me and you copied the [get started lay-out from the docs ](http://framework7.io/get-started/)\nyou'll need to change this class  `<div class=\"pages\">`\n\nExample:\n\n```\n.pages {\n   overflow: auto;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n```\n\nThat'll fix it.\n ```\n   .tabs-animated-wrap > .tabs > .tab  {\n     overflow: auto;\n     -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n   }\n```\n\nThis solved my issue.\n  I've created a test page which shows this issue on iOS safari - tested on an iOS8 iPhone 5s.\nhttp://www.oddrealm.com/test/\n\nWithout the swipeout I can easily load 600 list items.\nWith the swipeout, it crashes.\n\nOn cordova apps it only takes about 150-200 list items before it crashes.\n Uses the Infinite Scroll http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/infinite-scroll.html\n The infinite scroll doesn't help. The issue is the amount of transforms being used on a single page. If we load it piecemeal or not doesn't matter. The first x amount will be fine until we hit the breaking point of elements on screen.\n At least it will not break early on. Solves part of your problem. Anyway.\n  Only a simple modification. Perhaps not necessary.\n I will.\n  Hi,\n\nHere the doc mentions \"templatesData\" : http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/template7-pages.html#.VD_5ddSpYpI\n\nAnd it doesn't work... After hours of debugging I found this \"template7Data\" in the changelog, tried and it worked. \n\nPlease update the documentation :-)\nThanks !\n\nBTW, thanks for the great lib\n Thanks! \n  I have find this code in ptr:\nif (container[0].scrollHeight === container[0].offsetHeight || app.device.os !== 'ios') {\nuseTranslate = true;\n}\n\nif the page content is too long , then the container[0].scrollHeight !== container[0].offsetHeight, so there is no translate when I touch and pull down on the page.\n android,  no translate when scrolling the page. e.g:\n\n``` html\n<div style=\"height: 2000px; overflow-y: scroll\">\n..\n</div>\n```\n\nwhen scrolling this DIV, there is no animation on android...\n  just a small typo\n Sorry, i didn't know how to make 2 changes in one Pull Request\n  just a small typo\n  Trigger Pull To Refresh\nWe can also trigger Pull To Refresh manually by using the following method:\n\n> myApp.pullToRefreshTrigger(ptrContent) - trigger pull to refresh on specified content content\n> \n> ptrContent - HTMLElement or string (with CSS Selector) of pull-to-refresh-content we need to trigger\n\nShouldn't this function calling fire the refresh event?\n\nIn my app,i have to do like this:\n\n```\nvar ptrContent = $$('.pull-to-refresh-content');\n\nmyApp.pullToRefreshTrigger(ptrContent);\n\n// load handsets when loading a page\ngetHandsets();\n\n// Add 'refresh' listener on it\nptrContent.on('refresh', function (e) {\n    // load handsets\n    getHandsets();\n});\n```\n\nBut it is bad a practice,I need something like this:\n\n```\nvar ptrContent = $$('.pull-to-refresh-content');\n\n// this should fire the refresh event\nmyApp.pullToRefreshTrigger(ptrContent);\n\n// **this code is no more need**\n// getHandsets(); \n\n// Add 'refresh' listener on it\nptrContent.on('refresh', function (e) {\n    // load handsets\n    getHandsets();\n});\n```\n Sorry,I was stuck.It WORKS FINE to trigger event after the listener.thanks\n  http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/device-api.html#.VDjf4vnLe1M\n\nin this doc,I see that there is a \"myApp.device.iso\"  phrase seems being misspelling\n\nmyApp.device.iso    boolean. Contains true for iOS device, otherwise contains false\n its just got doubled :) there are two 'myApp.device.ios' lines in the tables\n  https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/c11acb2aee34f0209752caa29ad6857df81a9452#diff-9ba71a7584ef351f398270737a7f5a5e\n\nLooks like the `isTabLink` check here is the culprit; my links are no longer considered valid: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/c11acb2aee34f0209752caa29ad6857df81a9452#diff-9ba71a7584ef351f398270737a7f5a5eR160\n\nIn my case, I'm using tabs with real URL's to totally different sections of a site. My tab bar code:\n\n```\n<div class=\"toolbar tabbar tabbar-labels\">\n    <div class=\"toolbar-inner\">\n        <a href=\"http://jjj.dev/activity/\" data-tab=\"null\" data-animatepages=\"false\" class=\"tab-link  tab-activity active\">\n            <i class=\"icon dashicons dashicons-admin-home\"></i>\n            <span class=\"tabbar-label\">Activity</span>\n        </a>\n        <a href=\"http://jjj.dev/members/admin/notifications/\" data-tab=\"null\" data-animatepages=\"false\" class=\"tab-link  tab-notifications\">\n            <i class=\"icon dashicons dashicons-lightbulb\"></i>\n            <span class=\"tabbar-label\">Notifications</span>\n        </a>\n        <a href=\"http://jjj.dev/members/admin/messages/\" data-tab=\"null\" data-animatepages=\"false\" class=\"tab-link  tab-messages\">\n            <i class=\"icon dashicons dashicons-email-alt\"></i>\n            <span class=\"tabbar-label\">Messages</span>\n        </a>\n        <a href=\"http://jjj.dev/members/admin/?toolbar=true\" data-tab=\"null\" data-animatepages=\"false\" class=\"tab-link  tab-self\">\n            <i class=\"icon dashicons dashicons-id\"></i>\n            <span class=\"tabbar-label\">Account</span>\n        </a>    \n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n Having the `tab-link` class serve dual purposes for styling and functionality is rather inconvenient. Thoughts on using a data attribute or different class instead?\n Still requires some stylistic overrides, as the styles for `.toolbar a.link` are different than `a.tab-link`, but it's workable.\n Looks fine enough here in 0.9.7. Feel free to close this.\n  Currently, osetting the tab links by `href=#<tab_id>` is the only way that works. Setting the tab-link via `data-page=\".<class_name>\"` throws an error when switching tabs\n\n```\n            // Find related link for old tab\n            var oldTabLink;\n            if (oldTab && oldTab.length > 0) {\n                // Search by id\n                var oldTabId = oldTab.attr('id');\n                if (oldTabId) oldTabLink = $('.tab-link[href=\"#' + oldTabId + '\"]');\n                // Search by data-tab\n\n                // FIXME oldTabLink has no length because there is no oldTabId\n\n                if (oldTabLink.length === 0) {  // EXCEPTION THROW HERE\n                    $('[data-tab]').each(function () {\n                        if (oldTab.is($(this).attr('data-tab'))) oldTabLink = $(this);\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n```\n\n``````\n<!-- Top Tabs -->\n<div class=\"tabs tabs-top\">\n  <div class=\"tab tab1 active\">...</div>\n  <div class=\"tab tab2\">...</div>\n  <div class=\"tab tab3\">...</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Bottom Tabs -->\n<div class=\"tabs tabs-bottom\">\n  <div class=\"tab tab1 active\">...</div>\n  <div class=\"tab tab2\">...</div>\n  <div class=\"tab tab3\">...</div>\n</div>            \n<!-- Tabs links -->\n<div class=\"tab-links\">\n  <!-- This links will switch top and bottom tabs to .tab1 -->\n  <a href=\"#\" class=\"tab-link\" data-tab=\".tab1\">Tab 1</a>\n  <!-- This links will switch top and bottom tabs to .tab2 -->\n  <a href=\"#\" class=\"tab-link\" data-tab=\".tab2\">Tab 2</a>\n  <!-- This links will switch top and bottom tabs to .tab3 -->\n  <a href=\"#\" class=\"tab-link\" data-tab=\".tab3\">Tab 3</a>\n</div>```\n\n``````\n Good work, you're really responsive.

I am not sure how to revert it back to the old behaviour.\n\nHere is a brief description of how the dynamic links are created in each page:\nThe view of the main page contains a large <div> that is preloaded with an ajax call. After completing the ajax call, this <div> should contain many links that lead to another page which is also loaded via another ajax call with even more links. This new preloaded content also another set of links to deeper pages that are loaded with other ajax calls. After going deep in the link hierarchy (about 3 pages deep), and then hitting the back button, the preloaded ajax content in the div are no longer there. Only the empty DIV is available. The content that populated the div with the initial ajax call have disappeared.\n I added the domCache property to all the views and the app is working perfectly fine now. Thanks\n  Can we have the Page autoboxed with the Template7 template, via passing some attributes/class configurations.\n\nAs the whole page can be placed with the placeholders; rather placing the placeholders via selectors.\n Thanks alot..

(as well as the sliding back gesture)\n Ive coded with it for ages, I can probably help a bit just a bit of direction would be helpful.\n\nThe first is routing is backbone style and it manages the DOM for you, in a really nice way. So it would be nice to use the router that comes built into Meteor. \n\nWhat's left is the animations, there are hooks with the router so it is possible to do them manually. Such as `onBeforeAction` (runs before the route change) and `onAfterAction` after the route has been moved to.\n\nIs there a way to manually navigate in between, or perhaps to make a global hook so all the pages can be used with the transition animations automatically- that way its nearly plug and play with meteor.\n Well, meteor and F7 goes very well together. Did someone manage to get meteor to work with F7 yet ?\n Newshunt doesn't use real routing (I mean, changes in URL for example). That's the hardest part I think :) \"Visually\", there're no problem between Meteor and F7. \"Technically\" there're some...\n\nBut first, I have to say that Meteor + F7 would be huge I think. I spent the last few days reviewing UI frameworks that could be complete, responsive (desktop + mobile) and native-friendly. F7 looks to be the best for me \u2014 Ionic is mobile-only ; Onsen needs Angular ; Supersonic is a end-to-end solution... And the others are not complete enough for what I need. If a real package could be made for Meteor (like [Meteoric](https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic)), it could have a lot of success ! There're already some, but with very little integration (only access to JS + CSS) : https://atmospherejs.com/?q=framework7\n\nSo, for what I saw, Meteor and F7 could work very well together IMHO, but there're some areas where they kind of overlap :\n- Dom7 (Meteor has jQuery) : not a big deal, as long as it doesn't weight too much. Any way to remove it from build (didn't see that in \"custom build\") ?\n- Templates (Meteor uses Blaze, very close to Template7, Handlebars...) : same as above\n- Routing : tough one...\n\nI tried to merge Meteor and F7 the last few days with little success. I guess the hardest part is to keep the reactivity of Meteor and its management of routes (URLs), while having F7 to manage the UI. Here are some solutions I tried or thought about, from the [F7 router API](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/router-api.html#.VegoVrztlBd) :\n1. With the `content` option : my best try, but it involves hooking Meteor UI ([_uihooks](https://gist.github.com/benstr/1ed39b35bb0b8e4c5de6)), which is certainly not the best way to do it. Still lots of bugs though, but in some simple cases it works. I feel like it's more a hack than a robust solution. Plus it's hard to manage navbars for example, because of the template layout management (iron-router).\n2. Via URL : By default, F7 makes an AJAX call, that's not really what we want to do with a Meteor app. Can't make it work, but it would be cool to hook there : don't make AJAX call, ask Meteor router to generate the right content, and give it back to F7. Looks like F7 doesn't have this feature (or maybe via 5.) ?\n3. Via Template7 : I'm not good enough to replace Meteor templating system. I don't know if it could be  made though (could break the \"reactivity\" of the templates ? And compatibility with other features/packages ?)\n4. Via pagename : would be great but how could F7 know about Meteor templates ? Meteor bundles all templates, so there're somewhere near, but not in the DOM (looks like it's what F7 expect).\n5. Via `preroute` : great option, but seems like IronRouter can't give the rendered template content (https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router/issues/834). Moreover, routing isn't just about appending HTML : Meteor also dynamically add event functions based on the template needed.\n6. One last option that I didn't try, is to use [FlowRouter](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router) instead of IronRouter. This one doesn't manage template rendering \"auto-magically\" like Iron does. So we may be able to achieve solutions 2. or 5. ?\n\nI don't know if I'm clear here, but I think someone smarter than me should definitely have a look :) Looks like good job has been done for Angular here, but it's far beyond my understanding : https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/35. Anyway, I think it's doable. @nolimits4web what do you think ?\n\nThanks for reading :D\n Yes, the main issue here is with routing. I think the best option here, will be not use F7's router at all, and just modify/extend Meteor routing to have same transitions and call F7's methods to init pages. The problem is I am not good enough with Meteor, so i can't much help here, we need some Meteor ninja here :)\n [Meteoric](http://meteoric.github.io/) - Ionic with angular stripped out, seems like the only full fledged mobile UI framework that works almost seamlessly with Meteor so far. I think its mainly because of how well the package authors of Meteoric supported it into Blaze/Meteor.\n\nHaving other UI frameworks to chose from will be a good thing. Framework7 is exhaustive in its approach and covers pretty much everything to make an app as close to feeling-native as possible. I guess some people are already using the css-only part of Ionic for Meteor+React apps. I want to use Framework7 with Meteor+React.. but just not able to figure out a way. \n :+1: Seconded for Framework-7 (phenomenal piece of work - absolutely stunning!) with React and Meteor. Meteor has official React and Cordova support,  but lacks a front-end UI kit. \n\nWith Framwork-7 it would be a killer combo!\n Meteor + React + F7 is exactly what I'm trying to do right now. Here I just posted another issue before I found this one: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/702\n\nThere are several attempts out there in github that aim to glue F7 with React, but they all use AJAX and/or another router. AJAX is not an option with Meteor and I want to use the F7 own router, because there happen a lot of magic that otherwise needs to be recreated (and maintained in future F7 releases). Because F7 is not just a CSS framework. There is also a lot of page/view related logics behind that are important for the UX. Unfortunately I still don't have success. I'm new to all these - F7, React and Meteor. The main problem for now is how to call app.router.load() with content that is actual DOM, which is produced by React Class. Or maybe a different approach - load a dummy HTML with app.router.load(), apply React.render on it and then somehow reinit the F7 page load functionality to apply its magics. I don't know. Any idea or hint is more than welcome! Thanks!\n I should have read this thread before I started developing using Framework7!\n\nI have been developing Meteor apps for more than 1 year and I absolutely love it! I just needed to do a mobile app, and I was shopping for frameworks, and since I know Meteor, I decided to look for something that fits on top of it.\n\nAdding Framework7 to Meteor screws up the whole routing thing. I tried setting `router: false` when initializing `var myApp = new Framework7({router: false})` but it didn't really work.\n\nThe best I could do is to add `class=\"external\"` to all anchors which disables the Framework7 router. \n\nP.S. I hated Meteoric. It is so primitive compared to Framework7. \n Is there anyway I can use only the required css stylesheets and js scripts from Framework without all the routing and views jazz? Meteor should take care of the rest\n Hi, I went to a different approach. I wanted to preserve the Framework7 logic as much as possible, including router. Framework7 is not just a bunch of CSS, but there is also a lot of JS logic behind it. Much of the beauty & power is exactly there. I also wanted React rendering, not using Template7 or Blaze. So, I try to use React as a glue between Meteor and Framework7. I've built a \"mini framework\" in order to sustain a React logic with Framework7 logic. So far without much issues. You can check it here: https://github.com/mishoboss/meteor-react-framework7\n Here's a video of my best attempt, using `_uihooks`: http://streamable.com/t5qu\n\nHere's a piece of my code. Still no navbar update, and a lot of weird bugs, but still...\n\n``` coffee\nTemplate.ApplicationLayout.onRendered ->\n\n  # Init F7\n  f7 = new Framework7\n    # Disable F7 router, use only Meteor's\n    router: false\n    # Native like behavior for iOS\n    swipeBackPage: Framework7.prototype.device.ios\n    animatePages: Framework7.prototype.device.ios\n\n  # Init main view\n  mainView = f7.addView '.view-main',\n    # Fix : rewind history when performing SwipeBack\n    onSwipeBackBeforeChange: (callbackData) ->\n      history.back()\n\n  # Hook to render views with F7\n  this.find('.pages')._uihooks =\n    insertElement: (node, next) ->\n      mainView.router.loadContent(node)\n    removeElement: (node, next) ->\n      return false\n```\n\nHTML templates needs to strictly respect F7 docs, of course. Each page template must be wrapped in something like `<div data-page=\"recipe-view\" class=\"page\"><div class=\"page-content\"></div></div>`.\n\nHope it can give some clues to someone better than me with Meteor :) Didn't work again on it for months anyway. Meteor recent updates and FlowRouter might help...\n\n---\n\n@minafarid `router: false` should disable F7 router completely... What do you mean by \"it didn't really work\" ?\n\n@mishoboss awesome... Looking forward to see more !\n @nicooprat  When I disabled F7 router, still only the links (`<a>` anchors) with 'external' class works as expected (e.g., changes the template). I will give it another shot, maybe I am doing something wrong.\n\n_Update:_ @nicooprat It was my mistake! Disabling the F7 router works fine! \n P.S. Meteoric is no longer being actively maintained. I guess the author abandoned it since Meteor started supporting angular and ionic directly (which, IMHO, was not a smart move. The whole goal was to standardize the templating)\n @minafarid Glad to hear ! Concerning the official support of Angular, React, Ionic... well, as long as it's still in different packages, that you're not forced to install, I guess it's fine. Always good news when big players play together :) They just followed popular demand I think. Let's make Framework7 popular too !\n Thank you @nicooprat so far it is doing everything I need :) I will tell my friends about it actually! \n Hello @nicooprat \nCan you share your code and structure please?\nI'm trying to build it with tabs view and I was just trying to implement detail views which it blows right now.\n @fuatsengul I'll try to find some time to make a simple routing example.\n would be awesome @fuatsengul \n As promised, I just created a small repo : https://github.com/nicooprat/meteor-framework7-routing\n @nicooprat thanks for putting together the repo. I think I'm going to give it a try. I've been trying to figure out a way to use Framework7's routing with Meteor but haven't cracked it yet. Since Meteor is agnostic about routing it seems to me that it would be best to use Framework7's router if possible.\n\n@nolimits4web It seems like Framework7 provides plenty of hooks and options for getting it to work well within Meteor. I was thinking of rather than using ajax to fetch the template, in Meteor, the template is already in memory via Template[template_name] and it can be render on demand much like a template fetched via ajax. It's pretty much the same thing. I think I just need to figure out how to hook into the ajax call and instead of fetching the template just return it. It seems like just a little bit of sugar is missing...\n @lance-anderson I wouldn't be afraid to modify F7 and submit a PR if that's what's needed to bypass ajax.\n @lance-anderson You're welcome.\n\nSpeaking of routing, routers like Flow Router allows us to fully embrace the reactivity concept of Meteor (by watching path changes for example). Using F7 router would make us loose that advantage, I guess.\n\nI also tried the solution you mention, but if you just \"render\" the template with Blaze, you loose the reactivity part of Meteor once again.\n\nThat's why I tried to use F7 only for its UI part. That being said, I would be very interested to see what you could manage to d !.\n I'm trying to use FlowRouter + Tabs Layout but I can't see how this can be done because the tabs layout switch views by `id` of the `tab view`. Anyone with the same problem?\n @lnmunhoz You could try to use [Blaze Layout](https://github.com/kadirahq/blaze-layout) and use one layout for each view, then one template for each page inside these views ? The tab bar could be a single template embed in each layout.\n Here is a working project with Meteor, React and Webpack too.\n\nhttps://github.com/D1no/touch2s\n @fabiodr this is huge !\n @nicooprat  Is this now compatible with meteor? if yes, please share if you have example repo or let me  know the status of this. I want to use this with meteor for mobile\n @srinivasdamam No idea if there's has been any news on this! I didn't work on it since my last comment. If you are targeting \"native\" mobile only, I guess it will be easier because you won't have to use the URL for routing. You can use only the Framework7 \"view\" behavior.\n yeah its meteor compatible. I\u00b4m using it for production (iOS/Android)\n @rlech Could you explain how and for what purpose you're using it?\n- do you only use it for Cordova build? Or do you also have a \"web only\" version?\n- what router are you using?\n- are you using routing with URL?\n- did you succeed to use all of Framework7 features, such as swipe back and tab bar / content sliding on iOS?\n- did you use Blaze, Angular, React?\n\nThanks.\n > do you only use it for Cordova build? Or do you also have a \"web only\" version?\n\ncordova (iOS/Android) only because we dont need a webversion.\n\n> what router are you using?\n\nflow-router but this is not important. iron-router also works fine with f7\n\n> are you using routing with URL?\n\nwhat exactly do you mean routing with URL?\n\n> did you succeed to use all of Framework7 features, such as swipe back and tab bar / content sliding on iOS?\n\nMost of them yes but just when I need them in the UI. I use things like photoswiper, virtual list, infinite list. swipe back is coming with our next update. for me everything is working sometimes with some small meteor related hacks.\n\n> did you use Blaze, Angular, React?\n\nBlaze because I only had 2 weeks for everything but it should also work with react. If there was no lack of time react would be my choice. (fullstack coding, screens etc for app stores, icon creation etc takes time)\n\nMost of the stuff (or all for me I used) is working very well. \n\nBUT\n\nthe main reason some things not working is that you have to think about when and how your `DOM` is `created` and `rendered`. When you try to use f7 with elements who are not rendered already (because the data is from a collection that is subscribed but not 100% transfered to the client) its not working/its not working like exspected. Most devs just writing the f7 code in the `Template.rendered` function but this is not always the best way. always be sure you init things when your DOM is really ready. thats why sometimes you will have problems when you do the normal `oncreated/templatesubscription` stuff and just init `f7` after that. This workflow depends on how customers use your app.\n\ne.g. you like to show a list of documents with a virtual list and you init everything in the `Template.xxx.rendered` you will have problems when the subscription is **not** ready but you have fired your f7 code already.\n Thanks for your feedback.\n\n> what exactly do you mean routing with URL?\n\nA typical native (or cordova) app doesn't need to bother with URLs, although a web app has to. So my question was to know if you succeeded in using the \"view\" behavior of F7 _and_ the \"URL\" behavior of Meteor router. According to your previous answer, I guess you didn't try to accomplish that.\n\nYes I get it, always same headaches with async behavior :) I often find myself using some `Meteor.setTimeout()` to ensure that the DOM has been rendered _and_ inserted into the document...\n\nWould you mind showing us the result? Is your app published?\n I'm working on an App prototype that implements the following stack: Meteor 1.3.2.2, FlowRouter, React, react-mounter, react-addons-css-transition-group and Framework7 latest version. It seems to work very well, transitions included (using ReactCSSTransitionGroup).\nBut... React reacts badly when someone else touches the DOM. And that's exactly what FW7 tries to do continuously. It means that any inline style which FW7 applies on DOM is killed by React after the component's re-render. So, for example, no center alignment for the title in the navbar, no dynamic navbar left/right translation and so on...\n\nThe **FW7.addView('.view')** method is called in **componentDidMount()** method of the **layout** component... but it should be called on every component in order to keep everything updated! Too much!\n\nAny suggestion to avoid this?\n\nThanks\n  When building a fullscreen app with PhoneGap without statusbar, Framework7 still reserves the space.\n\nI tried to remove the placeholder div.statusbar-overlay but the class with-statusbar-overlay always gets added resulting in a black gap.\n\nThe check for statusbar is wrong at https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/a2dcc853e5a3b722315f61051a1e50dd8ec38b03/src/js/proto-device.js#L61\n\nbecause the device width & height are always equal with Phonegap and IOS.\n\nMaybe you should add check for having the .statusbar-overlay?\n ![screen shot 2014-09-21 at 16 42 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/504730/4348844/0e56dba4-419e-11e4-8a4b-0f6191279dbd.png)\n\nwell the check doesn't work for me. width & height are always equal, with or without statusbar.\nAlso the statusbarOverlay:false option has no effect\n\ntesting on IOS7\n yes I checked exactly with the Safari dev tools. when I removed the with-statusbar-overlay class from the body everything was fine and the gap disappeared as the content was fully utilised\n Seems to me that with the latest PhoneGap/cordova the status bar is always an overlay of the content. I tried to change fullscreen option but didn't made any different window width & height were always the same as screen width & height when checked with Safari inspector\n yes I tried the plugin, but didn't really do much of a difference for the hiding as the statusbar can be easily hidden with the default options.\n\nBtw the statusbarOverlay:false option did the trick! I wasn't rebuilding well :smile: \nwith this option it is all fine, but still your default detection seems wrong\n tried the statusbar plugin and its option in config.xml to:\n<preference name=\"StatusBarOverlaysWebView\" value=\"false\" />\n\nbut it didn't made any difference - only the f7 statusbarOverlay:false helps. If not set the black gap appears\n I am facing a similar issue with phonegap.\nAlthough I don't have the black gap at the top. But when content is scrolled down the gap appears. If content is scrolled up first, then the gap never appears upon scrolling down. It at the initial state of any page init. I tried the mentioned cordova plugin and statusbarOverlay:false. Still couldn't fix it. Any suggestions ? thanks\n\n![e959a512-5155-11e4-9e58-d1423a2dc480](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629055/5276813/b552401c-7b03-11e4-982e-5de092f19aef.png)\n Oh This has solved my sub issues.

Good job :)\n\nI am trying to add the back button on android, so when you press on a link to a page that's being added to the stack, when you press the back button in android, it will pop the last page that was before...\n\nIs there any method to do that? or is this for the wishlist?\n\nThanks...\n it was added in 0.9.6\ntry to take a look at the uniqueHistory option\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/init-app.html#.VB6hkPl_vYQ\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/views.html#.VB6hKvl_vYQ\n Hi Vlad, thanks, I think it worked.:)\n\nIs there any chance you can add this somehow to be v asked inside an update in the future? It could be amazing to have work out of the box.\n\nThanks man and good day\n Hi Vlad, thanks for getting back to me.  What I mean, is if you could add automatic back button support in android, it would be amazing.  I also wrote to you on the forum, I checked onsen ui and they somehow have this built in, but I am not a professional coder, so I can not understand how to do something like this in framework7.  \nMaybe use somekind of code that can see that the user is on android, and just fire the code to bind the back button, or something like that...\n\nSince I use also alot of android, I must say that framework7 is currently the fastest and most slick framework I checked.....  So for a user like me (I know the framework is geared on ios), if you put that in automatically it would be really great...\n\nThanks for your time..\n Hi Vlad,  that would be amazing if you add it. built in android back button support will be a great feature:) \n @shaulhadar, @valnub & @nolimits4web any reason to keep this open? Seems @shaulhadar found a fix thats isnt suitable for inclusion in f7 and as the issue was opened almost 3 years ago i think its safe to assume its resolved Hi @nolimits4web ,\r\n\r\nI am using 3 tab-based layout, each tab has many pages after opening all pages and going back its showing first tab instead respective tab. Do we have any way to fix it.   The current structure for loading pages from different files with Ajax is all great, but sometimes you need just a few pages that are in the same file.\n\nIs it possible to have structures like this:\n\n```\n.views\n  .view\n     .pages\n        .page data-page=index\n            .page-content:\n                a src=#other_index\n        .page data-page=other_index\n            .page-content\n```\n\nSo that we can have multiple pages that can be switched with a simple link pointing to the other page data-page attribute\n\nOr are there other ways to achieve this?\n Thanks, Vlad - yes I know about the loadContent, but it will be indeed much better to have multiple pages next to each other in the html. This way all the content is already available and you can even do directly some nice transitions between the pages. Like Flipboard.\n\nHope you can get it quickly done, as it is a key feature for me, that I want to show off at Adobe MAX conference begin next month http://max.adobe.com/\n\nSee https://www.adobe-max.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=petrov&searchType=session&tc=0&sortBy=&p=&i(10041)= \n\nSo Framework7 will be getting some good promotion :smile: \n  Hi Vlad,\n\nI know you have a split view app in demos, done with custom css, but split views are really an integral part of IOS design, so maybe you can make them standard available, like the left and right panels and popups you already have.\n\nIt will be nice to be able to make them with ready to go css classes and also have them responsive, so for example the left panel gets hidden when there is no room and the panels become single cascading panels, like the settings on IOS.\n\nThanks,\n   George\n Was split-view functionality already implemented? As we are now at 1.0.6\n\nWill be also nice if it can be combined with a drop down list. For example if there is room left panel is displayed but if not it becomes available under drop down button\n It would seem this feature never really made it but is still a valid request  Hello.\nIn my application I've faced that if slider has not enough items to full it in width, it aligns items to right. I want to force it to align to left.\nHere's the idea. I think it also needs to be adapted to vertical slider and to rtl, but not fully sure how to do it. Can do in next commits.\n @nolimits4web, yes, I'll prepare it.\n Here's what I'm trying to achieve. Here we have two sliders with slides per view = 4 and only three slides.\n\n``` javascript```\nvar s1, s2;\ns1 = app.slider('.slider-1',\n{\n    slidesPerView: 4\n});\ns2 = app.slider('.slider-2',\n{\n    slidesPerView: 4,\n    align: 'reverse'\n});\n```\n\nBy default, slider align items to right. For the UI needs I need to align to left.\n![reverse](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2124761/4345013/f64a7ac6-40b1-11e4-825a-838bfe197f23.png)\n  Its awesome to have such a great library for the hybrid applications.\nLooking for the support for IE, as most of the users still follow the same.\n\nAlso, Binary apps for the Windows Phone may requires the same.\nLooking forward to hear from you.\n\nThanks,\n Thanks.. Hopefully no issues with W-10 SPARTA edge browser\n  Change order of cache function, now the callback runs after the\napp.cache.push, so the cache is set anyway if enabled.\n  Good day.\nIt looks like F7 has strong support for mobile events, like swipe and tap. Is it possible to make use of this events directly? For instance, I want to create custom behavior on swipe or smth. Does `Dom7` exposes this events? (`$$('.selector').on('swipeleft', fn)`)\nThe documentation does not cover this issue.\n Yes, I used Hammer.js before.\nFor now I'm using Quo (https://github.com/soyjavi/quojs) with similar possibilities.\nIt provides its own jQuery-like API and allows to create delegated handlers:\n\n``` javascript\n$$('.selector').on('swipeLeft', '.subselector', fn);\n```\n\nwhich is exactly what I need.\n\nIt would be great if Dom7 will do so, because it's using such events internally, already, and doing it good. Will stay on Quo for now and looking forward for next releases of F7, thanks for help.\n\nand yes, \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432-\u043d\u0430-\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0443 :)\n That's what i want too !\n Me too!\n +1\n +1\n why aren't people using reactions or \ud83d\udc4d emoji?\n I would like to be able to respond to a swipe event in a custom way.

Do I need a new version of Framework7?  Was testing the latest version. Found that the popover is not closing at all. Closes only when you click on the options. Tested in mobile safari in iPhone 4s.\n @palhimanshu1991 Do you mean that you're still able to scroll the view under an open popup? If so, I can confirm this behavior; it happens with action sheets also.\n\nOtherwise, they both seem to function correctly for me.\n The day i logged this bug it wasn't working, to be sure, i checked multiple times in kitchen sink in mobile safari from iPhone 4s ios7. But i checked it again and it is working now. It could be something with my phone. Closing this issue now. \n  If I roll back to 0.9.5, smart selects work again.\n\nThe smartSelect code itself does not appear to have changed between these versions.\n Works in the kitchen sink, yes.\n No console errors.\n\nClicking a list item opens the smart select, users can choose whatever options are available, but clicking \u201cBack\u201d doesn't populate the list item.\n I'll run a git bisect tomorrow and figure out what F7 change is causing breakage. It's always possible it's something I'm doing wrong, too. \n I've narrowed it down to a change on 9/11. Still bisecting through the changes. Will report back.\n\nAlso am now getting this debug output, which may be helpful while I hunt around:\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'remove' of undefined framework7.js?ver=20140914a:1652\nafterAnimation framework7.js?ver=20140914a:1652\n(anonymous function) framework7.js?ver=20140914a:1672\nfireCallBack framework7.js?ver=20140914a:6155\n```\n\nThis output is happening only on a secondary view, which is setup with `addView()`. Other smart selects provide no console output, but also still do not work.\n It's related to `preloadPreviousPage` changes in:\n- https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/b1fbfab73cf2bdee6d17bfca0dba99d4354442a4\n- https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/c280922e007c18e489ff792bd76eed7d8488dcf3\n\nI have a need to set `preloadPreviousPage` to false when instantiating `Framework7({})`, so tapping \"Back\" will reload previous pages in the view. Now it appears Smart Selects are destroying the previous page.\n Specifically, this block in this change:\n- https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/c280922e007c18e489ff792bd76eed7d8488dcf3\n\n```\n                if (!(view.params.swipeBackPage || view.params.preloadPreviousPage)) {\n                    if (view.params.domCache) {\n                        oldPage.addClass('cached');\n                        oldNavbarInner.addClass('cached');\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        oldPage.remove();\n                        oldNavbarInner.remove();\n                    }\n                }\n```\n > So you have disabled both swipeBackPage and preloadPreviousPage?\n\nCorrect.\n It's usually content located at a URL, loaded then via F7's ajax methods.\n I'm also showing and hiding the indicator on ajax start and complete:\n\n```\n    onAjaxStart: function () {\n        myApp.showIndicator();\n    },\n    onAjaxComplete: function () {\n        myApp.hideIndicator();\n    }\n```\n\nTurning `preloadPreviousPage` on makes smart selects work again, but then `onAjaxStart` and `onAjaxComplete` get triggered when the smart-select \"Back\" animation stops.\n It's not fine for me. The animations work, but the smart-selects don't select new items. Clicking back does not save your selection, even on the kitchen-sink link above.\n Sorry about that. Hard to describe exactly what the steps are to reproduce. Thanks for being patient.\n  ![screen shot 2014-09-14 at 11 34 08 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/629055/4264240/40370a36-3c1c-11e4-8ba3-0b06b0c0bb71.png)\n\nScreenshot from the documentation:\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/swipeout.html#.VBWm-2SSyry\n :+1: \n  The view concept is extremely useful and allows for higher complexity apps, however it lacks some functionalities. Unless I missed it in the docs, which I apologize for in advance.\n\n1) For example, on app start if user is logged in load view-2 else load view-1.\nAs I understood initially the view that has class .view-main is the first one to show. How can I control that right before app starts?\nUnless I can just do a check and assign class (.view-main) before `var myApp = new Framework7();`\n\n2) Programmatically changing views in iPhone (not iPad - multi-view):\nSo far I was only able to do it using tab-link and href=\"#view-x\" as shown here: http://www.idangero.us/framework7/examples/tab-bar/\nOtherwise, without having view as a tab and regular link like `<a href=\"id-of-some-view\" class=\"item-link\">Link</a>` doesn't seem to change the view. How can this be done?\n :) yeah, definitely overthinking. I guess I just tried to stay within the framework too much, but thx\n  You brought the i.icon height override in at the wrong level, so it isn't being applied.\n Very odd indeed. This is what I'm getting, you'll probably spot it straight away, if there's something wrong, but I can't see it.\n\n![f7-css](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/723619/4265805/81b6a2d8-3c61-11e4-9a8c-a56a9614f3a3.png)\n Ah I see now, the height being specified in 'icon-camera' is overriding my height. I guess that needs fixing then, so that the icons height is specified in 'i.icon' instead of for each different icon.\n It's the being lower down, I think. But, seeing how the height is required for the correct display of icons in this situation, I really think it should be part of Framework7's default behaviour for this situation. I'll look at another/better solution.\n  When a page has tabbar (using fixed/through). Padding is now increased as follows to prevent page-content clipping:\n- iPhone - 50px\n- iPad - 56px;\n  ![20140911165331](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/836517/4231434/1088390a-3991-11e4-9dcd-cfe7f40554cf.png)\n\nhave more than 2 pages ,i found the early ones were removed.\n    I tried this\n\n``` html\n<div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page no-navbar no-toolbar\"> ... </div>\n```\n\nit works on any page that comes next, except Homepage (index), whats wrong?\n\nAnd how do you hide Tab bar?\n\nIs there any way to load pages (HTML) for tabbar links? Currently if I place href=\"somefile.html\" it slides it from right instead of switching page without an effect like default tabbar behavior.\n Thank you.\n you should update the documentation regarding:\n\n> You also need to add \"hidden-navbar\" class to its parent View, and \"hidden-toolbar\" for toolbar/tabbar\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/navbar.html#hide-navbar-automatically\n > You also need to add \"hidden-navbar\" class to its parent View, and \"hidden-toolbar\" for toolbar/tabbar\n\nDoesn't work at v1.2.0.\n\nAfter read the source code this work, but it is undocuement;\n\n```\n<div class=\"navbar navbar-hidden\">\n\n<div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page no-navbar\">\n```\n  now what's solution?\n thank you for solution\n What about the toolbar? :)\n  It would seem better to just be able to say that all `tab-link` icons in a tabbar are implicitly given the needed height of 30px, over default icon class height of 20px.\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"toolbar tabbar tabbar-labels\">\n    <div class=\"toolbar-inner\">\n         <a href=\"#\" class=\"tab-link\">\n            <i class=\"icon icon-camera\"></i>\n            <span class=\"tabbar-label\">Camera</span>\n        < /a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nMakes more sense semantically, and it just works without any additional effort, save for specifying the icon you want to use. Spent too long figuring out this wasn't already the case.\n  for example,i have 2 views,how to get active view?\n    div class=\"view tab view-contact active\" data-page=\"contact_page\"\n    div class=\"view tab view-me\" data-page=\"me_page\"\n $$('.tab.active')\n Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function , can't loadPage.\n$$('.tab.active').loadPage('login.html');\n var myView = myApp.addView('.tab.active');\nmyView.loadPage('login.html');\n\nI didn't understand what you want to do\n @ourcd I think this questions should be in the forum\n  Hi Vladimir,\n\nI'm trying to fix what seems to be an issue in the framework7 fastclicks implementation.\nAfter spending 2 hours i gave up.\nI have a very simple testpage: see screen 1.\nReproduce steps: \n- On an ipad: After pageload, first click in the middle of the page\n- Then click on the fileinput itself\n- Expected result: Native fileupload dialog appears above the fileinput element\n- Actual result: Native fileupload dialog appears in the middle of the screen\n\nOnce i close the native dialog and click somewhere else on the page (not on the fileinput element) the dialog appears again.\n\nWhen i comment the f7 codeline:\n$( document ).on( 'touchend', handleTouchEnd( e ) );\nthe problem is solved.

Instead, the pull-to-refresh wants to kick in before the scroll position is 0, and the only way to reset the panel is to quit the web app and reopen it.\n\nMaybe this isn't a use-case you'd considered, or maybe it's a Safari bug, but I'm documenting it here incase someone can duplicate. \n Something similar to:\n\n```\n<div class=\"panel panel-left panel-reveal\" data-panel-url=\"the endpoint\" data-panel-since=\"last time successfully refreshed\">\n    <div class=\"panel-content pull-to-refresh-content\">\n        <div class=\"pull-to-refresh-layer\">\n            <div class=\"preloader\"></div>\n            <div class=\"pull-to-refresh-arrow\"></div>\n        </div>\n        ...a bunch of list blocks and content blocks...\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nAnd then...\n\n`myApp.initPullToRefresh( $$( '.panel-left' ) );`\n\n...to initialize it.\n The layout you recommend addresses the exact problem, so thank you. However, it now exhibits the same behavior as traditional pull-to-refresh setups when the height is taller than its container, which is likely a separate (and difficult to fix) issue related to the document over scrolling bug. In this case, when the top is 0, pulling down pulls the entire document down instead of the pull-to-refresh element.\n Correct. I have a hunch something similar occurs on iOS 7 also, though.\n This fix seems to have rebroken things in iOS 8. I haven't reverted yet to confirm, though.\n Reverted back to https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/12affa49753e921d853d96c052a76d370ba41852:\n\nUsing the structure you recommended here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/216#issuecomment-54204231:\n\nScrolling back to top: 0 is possible again, but the pull-to-refresh still happens on any equivalent scroll-up.\n\nBefore rolling back, it is impossible to scroll the panel back to top: 0, either with your recommended markup structure, or the normal panel one.\n Before https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/db17a9a0d57fcac533abbb2f7799efbb1c2477cd:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hyh46wmfx4lkgq9/Before.m4v?dl=0\n\nAfter https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/db17a9a0d57fcac533abbb2f7799efbb1c2477cd:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rabu321fzzyqx3t/After.m4v?dl=0\n\n> it doesn't move whole app down\n\nThis is true, but after the fix, it also can no longer be moved back up.\n Thanks for your diligence, Vladimir!\n Using iOS 8 GM and Xcode 6 GM.\n\nThis is my panel markup:\n\n```\n<div class=\"panel panel-left panel-reveal\">\n    <div class=\"view\">\n        <div class=\"pages\">\n            <div class=\"page\">\n                <div class=\"page-content pull-to-refresh-content\" data-panel-url=\"{snip}\" data-panel-since=\"{snip}\">\n                    <div class=\"pull-to-refresh-layer\">\n                        <div class=\"preloader\"></div>\n                        <div class=\"pull-to-refresh-arrow\"></div>\n                    </div>\n\n                    ...panel sections...\n\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWhich looks functionally identical to yours.\n\nThere must be some other JS conflicting with the pull action. I'll keep looking around, and report back.\n I'm looking through my JS now to see what else might be interfering.\n\n`{snip}` is just me editing out some PHP that outputs JSON endpoint URL's.\n This was the problem:\n\n```\n.panel .page-content,\n.panel .page,\n.panel .pages,\n.panel .view {\n    overflow: visible;\n}\n```\n\nI had added it to brute-force the `pull-to-refresh-layer` to be visible.\n That's exactly what I did. Thanks, again.\n To confirm, this is now resolved (again). Sorry for the delay.\n  Could not pullToRefresh when load other page and get back.\n My mistake, I add some class like page to body tag. It caused this issue.\n\nclosed.\n  Hi,\n\nWhen using the SearchBar in IE10 (or IE11 in IE10-document mode), the html elements in the page are not accessible anymore. This is because the z-index of the searchbar-overlay element blocks other page elements.\n\nYou can reproduce this by looking at the SearchBar example:\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/searchbar.html#.VAQ3FGbCRUS\nThere the scrollbar is unscrollabe because of the overlay.\n\nIs a fix possible for this problem?\n\nKind regards,\nMartijn\n Thanks for the suggested fix!\n  what do you think?\ni need a css selector when ptr is pull down\n  there is color issue on back icon when I user framework7.rtl.css\n Hello , I added this class to rtl file and it fixed my issue\n\nback.theme-yellow, .theme-yellow i.icon-back {background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\' viewBox=\\'0 0 12 20\\'><path d=\\'M10,0l2,2l-8,8l8,8l-2,2L0,10L10,0z\\' fill=\\'%23ffcc00\\' transform=\\'translate(12,20) rotate(180)\\'/></svg>\");}\n\nbut its just for theme-yellow\nwe will need to change path's fill attribute for each color\n\nhope this help\n  platform: pc chrome Version 37.0.2062.94 m\nissue: can't see chinese text\n\nyesterday i updated chrome,then can't see chinese text.\n @ourcd I use some chinese character on my project and don't have this issue, are you using some special fonts? do you have \"charset=\"utf-8\" meta tag?\n @tachun  \nyes,has utf-8 meta:\nis your pc chrome Version 37.0.2062.94 m ?\n  if i call updatePagination manually the slider-pagination-active get removed\n thanks, thats works so after adding ajax slides need to call this:\nslider.updateSlides();\nslider.updatePagination();\nslider.updateClasses();\n\nmaybe the updateSlides should call updatePagination and updateClasses?\nor maybe we need new method slider.addSlides(data)?\n thanks\n  Hello\nusing back feature ignores \n.query of (e.detail.page)\n\nthanks for the great framework :)\n page 1 : user.html?id=1\npage 2 : about.html\n\nwhen I navigate from user.html?id=1 to about.html and go back I return to user.html not user.html?id=1\n I just use links like : \n[a href='user.html?id=1']user1[/a]\nback link : [a class=\"back link\"]back[/a]\n $$(document).on('pageBeforeAnimation', function (e)\n    {\n        var page = e.detail.page;\n        var id = page.query.id;\n.\n.\n.\n  The new swipeouts introduced in https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/b361966f92f9d26d6dcc45c6dcae05f17acb227a have a few issues:\n- They animate less smoothly\n- Text is not centered through-out the entire animation\n- When used with `.item-link` elements, they overlap and jump while fade animations occur\n- Are not backwards compatible with existing swipeouts, as the `swipeout-actions` and `swipeout-actions-inner` classes are gone.\n This is much nicer now. Go ahead and close this one.\n Confirming these are still looking very good in latest build.\n  right now if you init empty slider\nand after init you add slides with ajax than call mySlider.updateSlides();\nthe first screen will be gray(blank) and after swipe next it will work fine\ni temp fixed it like this:\non add slides check slides length if zero call mySlider.slideNext();\n thanks :)\n  In native iOS, Action Sheets on iPad's automatically become popovers. Currently in F7, Action Sheets on iPad's end up looking... a little silly.\n\nMore docs on the native UI here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/UIKitUICatalog/UIActionSheet.html\n\nIt would be killer if F7 Action Sheets automatically did the same.\n I'd seen that, but noticed there wasn't an issue for it.\n\nYou're correct that making popovers more flexible has also forked the behavior, and I agree that adding a property to allow them to smoothly convert back and forth seems best.\n Using this new method of passing 2 parameters causes all action sheets to become popovers on iPhones. I think there's a `true` that should be `false` here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/2497acad1c014b54db66d388ed7a0c458a33024e#commitcomment-7766329\n\nIf so, I can send a pull request if it's helpful.\n  for example:set the sex on init,\nwhen sex is male,the male item selected on init;\nwhen sex is female,the female item selected on init.\n\ncan see this issue's screenshot: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/204\n  http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/checkboxes-radios.html#radios-group\non my two android phones are the same issue,but on pc is ok.\n\n```\n<div class=\"pages navbar-through\">\n    <div data-page=\"profilesex\" class=\"page no-swipeback\">\n        <div class=\"page-content\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff\">\n            <div id=\"sexedit\" class=\"list-block inset\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <label class=\"label-radio item-content\">\n                            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"ks-radio\" value=\"1\" checked>\n                            <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                                <div class=\"item-title\">\u7537</div>\n                            </div>\n                        </label>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <label class=\"label-radio item-content\">\n                            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"ks-radio\" value=\"2\">\n                            <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                                <div class=\"item-title\">\u5973</div>\n                            </div>\n                        </label>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n![screenshot_2014-08-25-09-31-11](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/836517/4025416/1650ca60-2bf8-11e4-981d-5bcf5c3d2779.png)\n  Is there an easy way to have a link load a page from the left? I'm using the .back class but I'm realizing that it doesn't really work that way. What alternatives? Thanks.\n Also it seems like using .loadPage would trigger the pushState that causes .back to load from history even if pushState option is false. Would that be a bug?\n Yes that's fine. I mostly want to just slide from left. Using the .back is a hack I think. Is there no solution currently to get the slide from left behavior?\n Thanks got it.\n  I decided to try Notifications instead of Modals for the updating functionality in my App. As I mainly develop stuff on an iPad 2 when I don't have access to my Mac, I render previews on a non-Retina screen. This is what a Notification's close box looks like:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6178765/4021940/3fb00a0e-2b0f-11e4-9a6c-4c2cf3a597cc.jpg)\n\nI guess this could be fixed by optimizing the SVG background-image to a lower resolution for low-res screens, so I will try that shortly. Just wanted to note this issue exists before you release 0.9.6 to the public.\n\nI know SVG should render correctly in every size, as it's a scalable vector graphic. But images created on a larger canvas than it's actual use-case do render weird (at least fixed pixel images).\n  $$.ajax in callback can't access document,for example:  \n $$.ajax({\n        method: \"POST\",\n        url: SERVER,\n        data: {\n            \"pid\":100\n        },\n        success: function (data) {\n            $$('#logintip').text('tip content');\n        }\n    });\n has,it's in login.html,and can access it in onPageAfterAnimation.\nmyApp.onPageAfterAnimation('loginbyemail', function (page) {\n yes,in it,i find from server has 500 error,but server data echo back correctly.\n\nPOST http://xx.com/api.php 500 (Internal Server Error) framework7.min.js:18\nb.ajax framework7.min.js:18\ngetCode my-net.js:27\n(anonymous function) my-app.js:142\n yes,it's server problem.thanks.\n  i want to do app update use notifications,but i found can't add link in it. \nany suggestion for app update?\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/notifications.html#example\n and on android the close button not show.\n![20140823095928](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/836517/4019370/300baa78-2a69-11e4-816b-c52cf0ed54bc.png)\n For the link you can either add `<a href=\"URL\">text</a>` (replacing `URL` with your URL and `text` with your text) in the notification itself or you use Notification Callbacks (`onClick: function() {}` loading the view you want. You should also activate `notificationCloseOnClick` so you don't depend on the buttonto dismiss the notification.\n  Was sad to see support for rails pipeline go, any particular reason other than the clunkiness of my previous example.\n\nAnyway, I've made it a bit better, to build the rails version do either `grunt build --rails` or `grunt dist --rails`.\n\n**If you run `grunt --rails` (without a task) it probably won't work too well, as the examples/template don't reflect the rails-friendly paths.**\n No worries. I did end up thinking a similar thing.\n\nI'm still developing the gem, although it stalled between job changes.

This would add scrolling to the overlay itself (although it doesn't need it, so nothing would scroll) and prevent scrolling of the items.\n Confirming this behavior; I see it also.\n  in the document i see Linking between views,can use javascript to jump to other view?\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/linking-views.html#.U_NvJfmSzKM\n for example:\nin A view,i open a page info.html;\nthen in info.html i want jump to show B view;\nhow can i do?\n  I dont know if bug in code or in the docs but onSlideChangeEnd and onSlideChangeStart fired even if slide does not changed\n\nfor example: when move the slider but not enough so the slide stay in the same position\nthe docs say: \"will be executed after animation to other slide (next or previous). \"\n  Sorry if this has been asked before but I can't find the answer.

But it resembles it pretty well.\n![ios8demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6178765/3944539/3005d548-260a-11e4-93b8-b6d00b064861.gif)\n Making more progress here. I now have these... \"Swipeout Over-Swipes\" in my app. They're still not perfect and I need more time rewriting my code (back to centralized JS files). It's now called \"Modern Mode\" and this is what it looks like:\n\n![ios8demo2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6178765/3945921/d5d91448-2656-11e4-9fb7-4f9b27dbca1a.gif)\n\nI can share the code when it's done, so you can check and implement it if you want.\n @Modern Mode:\nThank you. I'll let you know when it's done!\n\n@Smooth GIFs:\nI record my footage via AirPlay Mirroring with an App called Reflector.\nIf required, I put it into Adobe Premiere Pro to cut away unnecessary parts and export it as .MOV.\nThen, I import the MOV into Photoshop and leave the default settings, in Animation Timeline aswell in \"Save For Web\" with GIF export selected! BAM! Smooth GIFs!\n Still making good progress here. Swipeout Actions now have more fluid animations and Overswipe (like in the second GIF) is also smooth and extends correctly now.\nThese parts are now configurable, for example if a user has an older device (like 4th Gen iPod touch) he can decide to disable Overswipe only or the whole thing (which results in default behaviour).\n\nEverything is fluid except for the transforming height when deleting a list entry. Did some research in 0.9.4 but it only sets `height: 0` and in the CSS, there is no visible transition rule. Maybe it's different in 0.9.5, but how's that thing animated?\n Yes, this is also found in iOS 8. As far as I know only in Mail, but it could be also in Notes. I didn't really check for it in other apps, my app wasn't working properly since Beta 4.\n Confirming this is definitely in iOS 8 Mail, and quite handy IMO. Less touches to perform the most common action.\n These are now in 0.9.6.\n I've been testing it for quite some time now (next to the \"Era\" update to Bug Reporter), and performance was always great. Even on my outdated iPad.\nIf you're doing this by adding a CSS class, performance will be better than if you're animating it through JavaScript.\n\nRegarding the swipeouts: I've got some serious problems porting the original iOS behavior to FW7 0.9.6. In iOS 8, buttons are moving on their own. Always. In FW7, buttons are moving together when swipeouts are opened.\n Can I make a small request!\n\nWhen the swipeout options are open, clicking on the item should close the options, not go into the link (when its a link item)\n When the swipe out is opened (you can see the options) clicking on the item should close the options.\n\nNot sure how I can give an example.\n  Hi,\n\nI try to use loadPage on leftView but it fails. It seems that it's only working on mainView.\n\nAnyone for help ?\n This is a [plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/tiiOog4U9DWHkDM5Zd6z) \n\nit's not working any more on any view. If you can have a look.\n I'm sorry. I was trying to mount a quick test plateform on plunker and I forgot stuff.\n\nI have made the modification you advise and i get the same behaviour as before: mainView loadPage works, not leftView.loadPage\n\nEdit: on init, it doesn't load but I can load in left view throw console.\n Thanks !\n  Hi,\n\nthere is a little hack that allow to have black text when status bar style is set to \"black-translucent\". It consists in removing the meta tag when iOS standalone mode is detect ([article here](http://blog.flinto.com/how-to-get-black-status-bars.html)):\n\n`if(window.navigator.standalone) $$(\"meta[name='apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style']\")[0].remove();`\n\nI have also need to modify a css class to prevent from a 20px black header in the left view.\n\n`html.with-statusbar-overlay body .panel { padding-top: 0px }`\n\ndon't know if it's a bug or something wanted so I report it here. \n This hack doesn't appear to work anymore in iOS 8. I'm unable to make it work in any of their example web apps.\n Related, the status bar text turns black when accessing the native file uploader UI. This is an obvious iOS bug, so dropping here.\n I've found that changing the content attribute instead of removing the meta tag entirely will result in a black-text status bar in iOS 8. However, I can't get consistent results. Once I use this technique, all web apps start showing black-text status bars.\n  I am trying to dynamically change the header of a navbar based on button clicks. The centering seems to not get updated when I do this. Not sure if this is supported? Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for the great library! I'm loving using it.\n Nevermind! Sorry. I just noticed that last bit at the end of the navbar documentation.\n\nI called this after updating my header text and it worked:\napp.sizeNavbars('.view-main');\n\nThanks!\n  Hi\n\nJust noted that, there seems to be no option for looping the slides in the Slider. Its mentioned that this is built similar to the Swiper - but is there a way I can enable looping in the slider? \n\nI know it rolls back once it reaches the last slide on setting the autoplay to true. But that does not seem to be suiting my application - I want to achieve the effect of looping that is done in the Swiper. Can you suggest any workarounds. \n\nThanks,\nYogesh\n Alright thank you :)\n +1\n  Hi Vladimir,\n\nI have a problem with the sorting of list-items in Chrome and Firefox.\nWhen i drag a listitem, and it is not precisely over the other drag-handlers, the dragged item 'hangs' of 'freezes' within the list. I made a video of this issue which i can provide if needed. (Or maybe i'll be able to attach a file to this issue.)\n\nIs this a known bug? Can you reproduce this problem?\n\nGreetings,\nMartijn\n ![sorting-issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8124461/3889173/2cbdcb10-220a-11e4-8aee-d4a84c869412.png)\n Thanks!\nMartijn\n\nVan: Vladimir Kharlampidi [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nVerzonden: dinsdag 12 augustus 2014 12:34\nAan: nolimits4web/Framework7\nCC: Martijn Clarenbeek\nOnderwerp: Re: [Framework7] Issue with listitem sorting on chrome and firefox (#174)\n\nAgh, i see now what you mean. Will fix it in next update\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/174#issuecomment-51897913.\n  Hi  :)\nCSS \"calc\" function not be supported completely on iOS 7.1 when it runs in Phonegap.\nThis screenshot is captured on GapDebug.\n\n![image](http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/7d4338cfgw1ej8fort9m4j210c0twdrx.jpg)\n Sorry, my mistake.\nI use framework7.css after renaming it to framework7.less.\n ``` css\nheight: calc(~\"100% - 20px\");\n```\n\nit works too.\n  on android test case step:\n1.open a popup page,\n2.then in the popup page open a photo browser,\n3.the photo browser will not show in front\ni think we need the last open photo browser in front.\n Confirmed fixed in dev version.\n  Rather than do:\n\n`$$( 'foo' ).attr( 'data-value', 'bar' )`\n\nIt would be nice to be able to do:\n\n`$$( 'foo' ).data( 'value', 'bar' )`\n  In iOS8, the entire document now has an overscroll effect when reaching the top or bottom of any page. This is problematic for full-screen web-apps that typically would have fixed position bars and status-bar overlays.\n\n![screenshot-2014-08-08-08 31 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/88951/3857159/959e2948-1f00-11e4-879f-2c2c1fa787e9.png)\n Safari 8 in Yosemite also exhibits this. The overscroll itself can be circumvented with the following hack, (but then the body element itself doesn't scroll, so it's not really helpful):\n\n```\nbody {\n    position: fixed;\n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nThe above code somewhat helps in iOS8 (specifically with preventing overscroll on bottom-aligned toolbars; top navbars are unaffected though. \n Has anyone come up with a workaround for this? Applying body/html fixed position styles is being ignored for all of my apps (phonegap + F7 + etc) on iOS 8.\n\nIn case anyone else is having the same issue, I've managed to at least clean it up a little bit by modifying the MainControllerView.m file to include the following:\n\n```\n- (void)webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView*)theWebView\n{\n    theWebView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.827 green:0.827 blue:0.827 alpha:1] /*color that matches .page background color */;\n    theWebView.scrollView.bounces = NO;\n\n    return [super webViewDidFinishLoad:theWebView];\n}\n```\n This is still really annoying, but I'm not sure any fix for this belongs in F7. It really is an iOS problem.\n in PhoneGap or Cordova, you need edit config.xml like this to disable document scroll\n\n`<preference name=\"DisallowOverscroll\" value=\"true\"/>`\n I'm closing this here, as there is nothing F7 could do by itself to avoid this very annoying Safari and iOS web app bug. IMO this is Apple's UX to fix.\n Not sure if I correctly understood your problem, but I'm using this code snippet (Coffeescript) :\n\n``` coffee\nscrolling = false\n\n$('body').on 'touchstart', '.page-content', (e) ->\n  if !scrolling\n    scrolling = true\n    if e.currentTarget.scrollTop == 0\n      e.currentTarget.scrollTop = 1\n    else if e.currentTarget.scrollHeight == e.currentTarget.scrollTop + e.currentTarget.offsetHeight\n      e.currentTarget.scrollTop -= 1\n    scrolling = false\n  if e.currentTarget.scrollHeight <= e.currentTarget.offsetHeight\n    e.preventDefault()\n  return\n\n$('body').on 'touchmove', '.navbar', (e) ->\n  e.preventDefault()\n```\n\nSeems to be working pretty well on iOS 8 (simulator + iPhone 5S tested, on web + Cordova hybrid app). Code taken from this SO answer : http://stackoverflow.com/a/14448336/758728.\n\nI'm also using a little CSS hack to force `.page-content` to always scroll in Cordova app, even if the content is smaller than its container : \n\n``` sass\n.page-content:after\n  content: ''\n  position: absolute\n  top: 100%\n  height: 1px\n  width: 100%\n```\n\nHope it helps.\n  Any chance we could get ajaxComplete and ajaxSend functions implemented like they are in jquery? I have a need to use them for jwt authentication and would prefer not to bring jquery into my library if possible.  Thanks!\n I've actually tested these in the latest master but I could not get them to work. `complete` and `beforeSend` are not being triggered.\n\nNeither this:\n\n``` javascript\n    $$.ajaxSetup({\n        'complete': function(xhr, stat) {\n            console.log('complete');\n        },\n        'beforeSend': function(xhr) {\n            console.log('beforeSend');\n        }           \n    }); \n```\n\nnor this:\n\n``` javascript\n        $$.ajax({\n            method: method,\n            url: url,\n            data : params,\n            dataType: 'json',\n            success : function(data, status, xhr) {\n\n            },\n            error: function(xhr) {\n\n            },\n            complete: function(xhr, stat) {\n              console.log('complete');\n            },\n            beforeSend: function(xhr) {\n             console.log('beforeSend');\n            }   \n        });\n```\n\nEDIT: I think the reason is the [return statement here](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/blob/master/src/js/dom7-ajax.js#L112)\n @nolimits4web Yeah, I've just edited my comment. It's jsonp.\n Ah, you're right! I've missed that. \nNo, I think there's no point in adding these callbacks for `<script>` loading. I'll be doing some tests with POST queries later on.\n Thanks for working on this. One less item I need to use jquery for.\n I can confirm that both callbacks work for GET, POST non-jsonp requests. I think this may be closed.\n  Setup the swipey-panel like:\n\n```\nvar the_app = new Framework7({\n    swipePanel: 'left'\n)};\n```\n\nAnd have lists like:\n\n```\n<ul>\n    <li class=\"activity-single swipeout\">\n        <div class=\"item-content swipeout-content\">\n            <div class=\"item-media\">Some image</div>\n            <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                <div class=\"item-title-row\">\n                    <div class=\"item-title\">Foo</div>\n                    <div class=\"item-after\">Bar</div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"item-text\">Content</div>\n                <div class=\"my-own-item-meta\">Link Link Link</div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"swipeout-actions\">\n            <div class=\"swipeout-actions-inner\">\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"swipeout-delete\"><?php esc_html_e( 'Delete', 'buddios' ); ?></a>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nWhen you swipe from left to right on any list item, the panel doesn't open. Similarly, pull-to-refresh doesn't work (unless you've already initiated an upward swipe first to get the scroll action started, ironically.)\n iOS8 currently. I won't have access to an iOS7 device for a few hours.\n Just tested pull-to-refresh without using swipe lists, and it appears this bug is related to changes in iOS8 that cause the entire browser window to overscroll, and not to swipe list items.\n  input change event not dispatched when typing,need lost focus ,eg:\n    $$('#mysignatureedit').change(function () {\n        var data=$$('#mysignatureedit').val();\n        var least=30-data.length;\n        $$('#editsignatureleast').text(least);\n    });\n  can we prevent from text select? \nthe button text,and some text we not want the user to select .\n  when there is a input onfocus,the toolbar will move up. maybe we not need to show it at this time.\n  First,I want to thank for the author of f7 framework.\nI want to know how to turn off the bounces effect. We use the webpage made by f7 in the ios app webview. Our programmer can't use the native pull to refresh. \nI hope you can help me,thanks.\n Thank you. I tried the solution but did not work.\nI just want to turn off the bounces effect of f7 ,which is diffierent to ios default effect. Because our programmer want to pull the web page to refresh it. But she can't trigger the touchmove event(perhaps it is the name) of ios.\nI notice in IOS in the kitchen-sick case page only has one page does not have the effect of bounces of f7.\nIt's Navbars And Toolbars page\n![qq20140808114236](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7686861/3852598/15aed57c-1eae-11e4-97aa-f8c7e1fd484d.jpg)\nI don't know why, and how can I do. \n This helps!\n\n```\n// Prevent bouncing\n$$('body').touchmove(function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n @ghost +1 thanks\n This works well with current Framework7 version to eliminate the bounce effect:\n- 1. Download https://github.com/lazd/iNoBounce/blob/master/inobounce.min.js\n- 2. Include script `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/inobounce.min.js\"></script>`\n- 3. Add css to .views container\n\n```\n.views {\n  height: 100%;\n  overflow: auto;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n```\n  this is the bug:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19827\nthe fix is to insert e.preventDefault();\nin pull to refresh if you insert prevent default the native scrolling not working, if I change the handleTouchStart to this, everything work fine.\n\n```\nfunction handleTouchStart(e) {\n if (isTouched && (app.device.os !== 'android')) return;\n```\n\nis that safe?\n video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufpZSobLNpU\n\ntouchEvents.end not called sometimes in some android\nhere is the bug details: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19827\n i tested on 4.0 and 4.2 both not work, so isTouched always start true after touching.\nif i click somewhere the touchEvents.end get called and the pull to refresh will work.\n\nhow to replicate:\nopen pull to refresh page, scroll down, now try to trigger the pull the refresh.\n yes, i checked on default, opera and chrome.\n\nby the way I dont think we should care about default browser, only latest chrome from android\n  So there will be some incorrect style problems, such as in checkboxes and radios inputs group layout.

Push state and history fixed. Needs a bit more testing, but it\u00b4s getting to a good state :)\n PS: How do you start the kitchensink locally? I guess you use a LAMP server because of the .php?\n One more thought: if the page name isn\u00b4t unique (the data-page has to be unique for the collection of pages, not for other views) we probably should also use the date or view name as suggested to you in the url...\n I\u00b4ve tested the kitchen-sink and other examples using AJAX and they seem to all work fine so far... I\u00b4ll build and test a combined example now, where some views use AJAX and some use inline-templates\n One limitation I\u00b4ve found when testing mixed environments: The push state is limited to the main view (in general, with or without this change). I\u00b4ve had a look and it seems feasible to store the current view with the state, what do you think? \n Ok, great... Yea, the push state only really helps when using it in a desktop browser... Having a global state in the local storage is a good idea, maybe with a option to get to a clean state - as with native apps preserving state and having the option to be closed to get rid of the current state if it crashes...\n Thanks, I\u00b4ll have a look... The branch is inline-templates in my fork.\n  Switching active tabs based on .tabs, not on the parent of the current t...ab, therefore also useable with a list; as discussed in https://github.com/thomasf1/Framework7/commit/eece04e10e6285201633188fb5c35b1de7527960\n\nI think this is a more elegant way of doing things, as the parent could include non-tabs with a class active; or as in my case the parent isn\u00b4t the right scope.\n That\u00b4s right... Well, nested tabs might break with the old code as well I guess (depending on the dom structure)... Any idea on how to make that nice?\n  There seems to be an issue with a grouped listview and pull-to-refresh. When the pull-to-refresh arrow is visible and the list is big enough, the items will scroll through the arrow on my iphone 5.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\n<div class=\"page-content pull-to-refresh-content\">\n    <div class=\"pull-to-refresh-layer\">\n        <div class=\"preloader\"></div>\n        <div class=\"pull-to-refresh-arrow\"></div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"list-block media-list\">\n        <ul>\n            <li class=\"list-group-title\">Test</li>\n            <li data-user-id=\"id\">\n                <a href=\"#\" class=\"item-link\">\n                    <div class=\"item-content\">\n                        <div class=\"item-media\"><img src=\"img/img.jpg\" width=\"80\"></div>\n                        <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                            <div class=\"item-title-row\">\n                                <div class=\"item-title\">Testing message</div>\n                                <div class=\"item-after\">Test after</div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div class=\"item-subtitle\">Subtitle</div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </a>\n            </li>\n            .....\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<script>\n$('.pull-to-refresh-content').on('refresh', function (e) {\n    // Emulate 2s loading\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        myApp.pullToRefreshDone();\n    }, 2000);\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nI dont see the bug in my Chrome browser but only on my Iphone 5 device using the phonegap developer app. Could somebody confirm this bug?\n This picture shows what happens when I pull down the window for refresh:\nhttp://i61.tinypic.com/33cpslu.jpg\n\nThis following picture shows what happens when I start scrolling the listview (and pull to refresh is still waiting 2 seconds):\nhttp://i60.tinypic.com/o02c04.jpg\n\nAfter the two seconds the list is restored to its original state and everything works again.\n Thanks for the fast replies. Currently I have switched to the item-divider class as a workaround :).\n  As discussed in the forum \"ListView without Ajax\". Still way to early to merge, but it\u00b4s progressing well.\n\nWhat it does:\nFirst take on switching existing pages (pages already in the DOM, not dynamically loaded via AJAX or dynamically created). For usage with client-side frameworks that handle templates and event bindings.\n Thanks so much for the feedback... I\u00b4ve overlooked the codekit file, that clearly should not be there... \n\nOn the main thoughts // history support:\nI\u00b4m kinda worried about history support as well... currently, as far as I\u00b4ve seen that works currently by the order in the dom, which probably is unreliable when just switching. I haven\u00b4t quite figured out yet how that works with the domCache, as there could theoretically could be a state where the order in the dom doesn\u00b4t correlate with the history...\n replaced by pull request https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/155  as I\u00b4ve moved it to another branch...\n  I want fork and modify f7, but I can't find docs after cloned this repo\n I think the docs should be put in this repo, would you do it in the future?\n I would update the Docs because of the many JS functions that can be used in production websites, even if they are for internal use.\nFor example you can call the Version or transition to pages manually without animation.\n Hi, I have forked this repo to https://github.com/sdc-alibaba/Framework7, we are trying to translate it to chinese. You can see a docs folder after checkout to dev branch. We are going to build a web site for chinese users. Maybe we could create a framework7.cn website.\n Nice, I am waiting for it. please tell me when you finish.\n We will finish in this month, but http://framework7.cn/ is not my work, I am trying to reach the author. I find the docs is not translated in this site.\n Haha, I have reach him.\n  when pushState: true.\n\n1.when popup is open and you press back button(on browser or android not the framework back button) the popup stays and the pages under the popup change.\nis there a way  to push a state on popup open? so the back button will close the popup?\n so its not useable except ios :/ there must be a way.\nthe only problem with pushstate on popup is the refresh will not work?\nwhat do you think of something like:\n#!/index.html\nwith popup:\n#!/index.html/popup\non refresh check if its end with /popup if yes remove it\n I 'hacked' it like so(i dont need refresh it run only as application):\non popup:\nwindow.history.pushState('', '','#!/'+window.history.state.url+'?&popup'); \non close popup:\nwindow.history.back();\n\nI still think its need to be solved in the f7 level\n hi Vladimir\nI got few ideas to solve this:\n1.add app option something like: pushStatePopup\n2. make popup automatic push state\n3. add some ready to use code to the popup docs how to solve it\nwhat do you think?\n\nthe popup state should be soft something like:\nindex.html -> click on popup -> index.html?popup\nthis way after refresh the index.html will load normally\n\nI use it like so:\non popup open:\n\n```\nwindow.history.pushState('', '', '#!/' + window.history.state.url + '?&popup');\n```\n\nsomewhere in the code:\n\n```\n    $$(window).on('popstate', function (e) {\n        myApp.closeModal('.popup.modal-in');\n    });\n    $$(window).on('click', '.close-popup', function () {\n        window.history.back();\n    });\n```\n Is this resolved?\n @valnub its not solved but I think that nolimits4web not seeing this as bug Will this be taken in mind soon?\r\nI'm having the same issue on my app, it is made for iOS and Android and having a lot of popups that need to be closed using the Android device back button. I managed to do it as members suggested:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$$(window).on('popstate', function(){\r\n  myApp.closeModal('.popup.modal-in');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n`window.history.pushState('', '','#!/#signup');`\r\n\r\nWe hope that this will be taken into consideration to have an easy option in next versions.  Looks like smart-selects only work inside pages. Would be nice to allow for them inside a popup, to allow for quick setting of options inside temporary pages.\n Thanks for the polite nudge; was able to get it working with that hint.\n\nThis docs page also hints at how to set that up:\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/views.html#.U95Ez8JOTFJ\n\nPlease close at your leisure.\n  Seeing all these Apps in iOS 7/8 having different themes (Settings: Blue items, Calendar: Red items, Notes: Yellow items) made me think that Framework7 should also have support for theming Navigation bars, Toolbars, Links etc.\n\nMy idea is pretty simple: The user is given 3 modes for theming: Global, View and Page.\n**Global**: The chosen theme is applied throughout the entire website, every View and every Page.\n**View**:  Theming is applied only to the View the user adds the theming class to, and therefore to any Page this View contains. Other Views still have their default (unthemed) appearance, or, if the user decides, any other theming class.\n**Page**: Theming does affect chosen Pages only and leaves other Pages or Views in their given state.\n\nThese values can override previous values, which means **View** overrides **Global** and **Page** overrides **View** (including **Global**).\n\nHere are some examples showing how modes can be applied (names will probably change):\n\n```\n<body class=\"theme-notes\">\n    <!-- Entire website will have Notes Yellow for Back buttons, arrows and Navbar/Toolbar items -->\n    ...\n        <div class=\"view view-main theme-maps-pink\">\n            <!-- Previously named elements appear in Maps Pink (found in debug settings) -->\n            ...\n                    <div class=\"page theme-numbers\">\n                        <!-- Page will appear in Numbers Green, even if it should be Notes Yellow or Maps Pink -->\n                        ....\n                    </div>\n        </div>\n</body>\n```\n\nAnd here are the colors of some Apps in HEX and RGB:\nNotes: `#eabb00` `rgb(234,187,0)`\nCalendar: `#ff3a2f` `rgb(255,58,47)`\n\niWork:\nPages: `#ef8b01` `rgb(239,139,1)`\nNumbers: `#00a650` `rgb(0,166,80)`\nKeynote: White on Dark Gray background\n\nMaps in iOS 7 has some interesting Debug settings, which can also change the app's theme (referred to as \"Key Color\"):\nRed: Same as Calendar\nGreen: `#4cd964` `rgb(76,217,100)`\nOrange: `#ff9500` `rgb(255,149,0)`\nYellow: `#ffcc00` `rgb(255,204,0)`\nTeal: `#37abdc` `rgb(55,171,220)`\nPink: `#ff2d55` `rgb(255,45,85)`\nGray: `#8e8e93` `rgb(142,142,147)`\n\nMaps also has a Blue theme, which is the same as the None theme (and therefore the Default theme)\n\nThemed elements include:\n- Navigation Bar elements\n  - Arrows\n  - Labels (not the Navigation Title)\n  - Buttons\n- Toolbar elements\n- Action Sheets and Popovers\n- Links found in `.page-content`\n\nThemes should be included in an external file (like `framework7.themes.css`) so they are easily accesible and expandable.\n\nMy question is: How do you (the Developer) and you (the User) like this Idea (even if it was optional with a custom build)?\n Hi there,\n\nOf course I meant Colors by saying \"Themes\". I just didn't think of Themes as themes in \"Dark theme\" or \"Bright theme\". \n\nI really like the approach by using data attributes, I'm just not that used to data, which is why I used Classes in the first place. There's nothing against this approach.\nActually, it's even better than using classes because, as I can see, the core parts of Framework7 rely on data attributes, and that's why a mix of classes (just for theming) and data attributes feels a bit... You know what...\n\nAnyways, I hope to see this in production version soon. It's going to be great!\n It seems I pressed the wrong button, wanted to leave this open if anyone else from the Community would like to say something regarding to themes. Sorry for that.\n Okay, I'm a bit speculating here, but `!important` overrides following CSS class selectors. But when any selector contains an `!important`, the selector overrides would be useless, right?\n\nI need to do a bit more researching, but I think I'm on to something here...\n I hope I can merge your changes with mine then easily, because I've edited many things to create more themable/colorable objects (Switches and stuff) and an acceptable Dark theme as a Night mode.\n I think you should create a theme utility where you can color pick different elements of the CSS and download a customisable build. This will be much more useful than theme-pink, theme-blue etc....\n  ```\napp.refresh = function (container) {\n        container = $(container);\n        if (container.length === 0) container = $('.pull-to-refresh-content');\n        container.addClass('transitioning');\n        container.addClass('refreshing');\n    }\n```\n\nwhat do you think about migrate it?\nI use it as a replacement for preloader because:\n1. more consistent users know that it mean something is loading just like they pull to refresh(facebook do the same when you open the app the ptr is pulled down and loading)\n2. its non blocking loader, the preloader block the whole screen, what if user has slow connection and he dont want to wait for page to load? with the preloader he stuck\n3. sometimes you need to just manuly refresh\n i am weak on naming :)\n app.pullToRefreshTrigger sound good, will you add it into the code?\n  Max textarea height does not take into account the soft keyboard.\n\n![Preview](http://oi59.tinypic.com/15gftye.jpg)\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any html change in height or position when keyboard is present on iOS.\n\nRather than a relative height, perhaps a fixed max height would be more reliable? (I know there are varying screen sizes) - or you could take into account that the soft keyboard will always be shown?\n Great - that makes sense. As you mention, some Cordova/PhoneGap plugins will return the height of the keyboard: https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard#events\n  When an alert comes up with a long message that wraps to the next line, the OK button does not close the alert. Happening on iOS device test.\n  without this fix you cant scroll zommed image in the photo-browser\nyou can read about it here:\nhttp://uihacker.blogspot.tw/2011/01/android-touchmove-event-bug.html\n  OS: Android any version:\n\nwhen i focus in input then i want to remove the focus by clicking any part of the app to remove focus and keypad unfortunately the focus wont remove to input. thanks.\n Did you try binding `body` or `html` to `blur()`?\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n$('body').on(\"click\", function() {\n    $('input').blur();\n});\n```\n @nolimits4web ok thanks :)\n  When an app is using fixed navbars, smart-select pages with search-bars lack the proper navbar classification, which causes search-bar styling to be positioned incorrectly. This change passes a navbar class no matter what, ensuring the smart-select page has the proper class.\n  i dont know if i should make pull request or put it here\nlittle bug in the browser where there is only 1 photo both arrows should be inactive\n\n```\nif(slider.slides.length==1){\n $('.photo-browser-next').addClass('photo-browser-link-inactive');\n $('.photo-browser-prev').addClass('photo-browser-link-inactive');\n}\n```\n\nshould be in onSlideChangeStart before if (slider.isFirst)\n thanks :)\n  add the config option to change the 'of' word on the navbar.\n I think its important because of two reasons:\n1. in RTL it look like this: \"of 1 3\"\n2. my all app is in another languge except that 'of' word so its look weird, i know that i can make my own template but it feels not good to create my own just for that word\n  Is it possible to navigate through pages with a modal popup?\nThink of a login popup with a button for \"Register\" functionality. My current workaround is to close the popup and navigate with the main View. What I am trying to achieve is that when clicking this \"Register\" button the login popup navigates to that Registration form itself.\n\n```\n<div class=\"views\">\n     <!-- Main view -->\n     <div class=\"view view-main\">\n        <div class=\"pages navbar-through toolbar-through\">\n            <div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page page-on-center\">\n                <div class=\"page-content\">\n                    <!-- Page content -->\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n     </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis is what I tried but it just controls the main View:\n\n```\n<div class=\"popup popup-login\">\n    <div class=\"login-screen modal-in\">\n        <div class=\"view view-login\">\n            <div class=\"page\">\n                <div class=\"page-content login-screen-content\">\n                    <form>\n                        <div class=\"list-block\">\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><a href=\"#\" class=\"item-link list-button signin-button\">Sign In</a></li>\n                                <li><a href=\"register.php\" class=\"item-link list-button\" data-view=\".view-login\">Register</a></li>\n                                <li><a href=\"#\" class=\"item-link list-button close-popup\">Cancel</a></li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </div>\n                    </form>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis is my current approach:\n\n```\n<li><a href=\"register.php\" class=\"item-link list-button close-popup\">Register</a></li>\n```\n\nThis one just closes the login popup and navigates the main View to login.php.\n\nIs there any easier way?\n It seems I managed it. Unfortunately including `.login-screen` in `.popup`. But anyways, it does work now. This is my current structure:\n\n```\n<div class=\"popup popup-login\">\n    <div class=\"login-screen modal-in\">\n        <div class=\"view view-login\">\n            <div class=\"pages\">\n                <div class=\"page\" data-page=\"login-page\">\n                    <div class=\"page-content login-screen-content\"><p><a href=\"register.php\">Register</a></p></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nI guess my main problem was that I forgot to add the View in my App Initialization. Thank you very much for your help!\n  ```\n mySlider = myApp.slider('.news-slider', {\n            speed: 200,\n            spaceBetween: 20,\n            preventClicks:true,\n            pagination: '.news-slider .slider-pagination',\n            paginationHide: false,\n        });\n$('.slider-slide').find('a').on('click', function (e) {\n        alert(mySlider.allowClick);\n    });\n```\n\nthe alert always fire on scroll over link, even if allowClick is false\n i got the \"allowClick\" by looking at the source as a temporary hack I use it like this:\n\n```\n$(container).on('click','a.gallery-image', function () {\n        if (mySlider.allowClick)\n            imageBrowser[id].open();\n    });\n```\n\nI have app like this:\nslider with 10 articles, the article template like this:\n{{title}}\n{{large long image}}\n{{text}\netc..\nwhen clicking on the long image a photo browser is open with all the article images.\nwithout the little 'hack' each swiping to next article open the photo browser as the image take most of the view and most of the swipes goes on hover her.\n I think he meant `preventClicks:true` which doesn't appear to be working for me either:\n\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/slider.html#.U9k8jMJOTFI\n\nIn fact, clicking on any slider fades the slider buttons, but the slider itself doesn't slide automatically when clicked. I'm unfamiliar with what the default experience should be though.\n\nI'd love a way to set sliders so their buttons/dots are always visible, or a way to separate and designate a connection between the slider indicator, and the active slide itself.\n Separate issue than this one, but `data-paginationHide=\"false\"` as an element attribute works for me, but `paginationHide: false` in slider initialization does not.\n Oddly, it was a combination of attributes and JS that was causing the problem.\n\nI had `data-pagination=\".slider-pagination\"` in my attributes, but was instantiating the slider with JS. That causes `paginationHide: false` not to work.\n I see that; makes sense. Thanks.\n  Try targeting a few initial pages per the example on the docs page.\n\nThe following code fires on all pages, instead of the `anything-here` page only:\n\n```\nMyApp.onPageInit( 'anything-here', function () {\n    console.log( 'every page load' );\n} ).trigger();\n```\n I expect it to only trigger the `pageInit()` when the page I've specified is requested. Right now (at least for me) `.trigger()` fires on every browser page reload regardless of the data-page I've specified.\n\nFor context, imagine a web app with 4 \"root page\" sections. Links to these 4 pages are `no-ajax`, and have their own \"sub pages.\" I want to manually run different JS for each of these 4 primary pages. I expected the above code to only run when the `'anything-here'` page is loaded; instead, it runs on all 4 root pages.\n\nDoes this make any sense, at all? :)\n  As lists do have .tablet-inset support, why should content blocks be left out?\n  1: pull to refresh endless rendering\na. go to page with pull to refresh\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/\nb.click f12 in chrome\nc.click on timeline tab\nd.click on record button\nthis how it looks like(not good make browser render all time):\n![pulltorefresh](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1615629/3734703/dcaf9436-171a-11e4-83c1-6f68ae898f63.jpg)\n\n2:browser re paint the whole screen on scroll\na.go to f7 page\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink/\nb.click f12>click on 'show drawer' icon>click on 'rendering' tab>click on 'Show paint rectangles'\nc.start to scroll and look how to browser paint the whole screen\nd. go to normal page like:http://www.idangero.us/framework7/\ne.repeat step b+c take a look that its not repaint the whole screen on scrolling(good thing)\n\nis there anyway to fix it?\n 1)about pull to refresh\nwhat do you think about remove the animation from .preloader and add it to : '.refreshing .preloader' ?\n\n2) i know its small problem its be good if someone will know how to solve it I cant find a way.\n\ntnx a lot :+1: \n     Er.

I launch the Kitchen Sink (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink) from the home screen in an iframe and many actions don't work properly.  As an example, try going to the \"Side Panels\" demo, then open the left panel.  The panel won't close by touching the space to the right.  Also, links doing show an \"active\" color after touching them.  In my app, the left panel can't be opened or closed by swiping either.

I will give this a test tomorrow.\n  I was wondering if you could add a plus icon to the css file? Its pretty much used throughout iOS mobile apps and would be very nice to include. Thanks!\n Thanks!

It can be frustrating in cases where users needs to enter details but cannot edit a certain spelling error or any text, he/she will have to rewrite the whole text. \n\nI checked it on your Kitchen-sink demo on form elements, the error was found there as well. You cannot position the cursor by tapping. You'll either have to hold or hold and drag to move the text cursor.\n\nI found that the problem is with Fastclick plugin.

Good idea.\n  Hi,\n\nI have a scenario where i have a searchbar in the mainview and also a searchbar in a popup. I had to init the popup searchbar manually to get it to work:\n\n```\nthis._framework7.popup( \".popup-userselection\" );\nthis._framework7.initSearchbar( pageContainer );\n```\n\nThe problem i have is that the popup searchbar results are also appended in the mainview searchbar results. If i look at the F7 searchbar sourcecode this makes sense:\n\n   app.initSearchbar = function ( pageContainer ) {\n       ...\n      var found = $('.searchbar-found');\n      var notFound = $('.searchbar-not-found');\n\nThese two selectors include other searchbars, causing the problem.\nIs there a possible fix for this? Or could i follow another opproach to setup two searchbars in one dom?\n\nF7 rocks!\nMartijn.\n I looked into it a bit more and found that:\n\n```\n        var found = pageContainer.find('.searchbar-found');\n        var notFound = pageContainer.find('.searchbar-not-found');\n```\n\nsolved my problem. Would you integrate this searchbar fix?\n   here is the scenario.\n1. i have a search_engine.html, the user will search and click the result to see the details in details.html.\n1. in details.html there is a button that will request the login credential, then user will be redirected to login.html.\n2. the user will login and i need to bring the user back to details.html with backbutton, which the back button is intended to back into search_engine.html.\n\nthe question is , is there a way to remove login.html to the backbutton target, and the target should be in search_engine.html and the search result will retain.\n\ni tried to remove the login.html page in mainView.history but still no luck.\n @nolimits4web I have done as explained in:\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/116#issuecomment-48782948\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.onPageInit('users-index', function (page) {\n  for (var i = 0; i < page.view.history.length; i++) {\n    if (page.view.history[i] === '/users/add' || page.view.history[i] === 'users/add') {\n      console.log(page.view.history);\n      page.view.history.splice(i, 1);\n      console.log(page.view.history);\n      // The history item is gone!\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nHowever... clicking on back will still load the form again (prefilled with whatever was there)\n `<a href=\"#\" class=\"back link\" data-force=\"true\">` instead of just `<a href=\"#\" class=\"back link\">` made it work, however I don't understand why?!\n However... force will remove all history. I just want to remove one item (the form) from the navigation history. How?\n This seems to solve it for me (after myApp = new Framework7)\n\n``` javascript\nmyApp.params.cache = true;\nmyApp.params.cacheIgnore = ['/users/index', '/users/add', 'users/index', 'users/add'];\n```\n\nIt was also possible to juse set cache = false.\nHowever setting those params within myApp = new Framework7() call did not work.\n  when using popovers for menus especially if they contain links to popups it helps to be able to close the popover without effecting the popup\n  Hi,\nI'm building an application with Framework7.\nMy compliments for this consistent, high quality/performance framework.\n\nThe issue i'm facing is: How can i navigate to other dynamically created pages within a view (or just navigate to the startpage of the view)? I have initialized the view and set the domCache to true. Then i added some pages using the loadContent method of the view. Because the pages are dynamic they don't have an url. (I tried to set app pushState to true to see if dynamic pages are given some url, but somehow enabling pushstate in my situation gave an error.). The dynamic pages all have a unique data-page name.\n\nI was hoping i could do something like: mainview.goBack( dataPageName ) or app.loadPage( dataPageName ). I'm using version 0.8.8.\n\nKind regards\nMartijn\n Thanks for the tip. \nIt's not easy indeed to make the transistion from the third page to the first page by removing the second page from the dom before the call to goBack().\nI had some additional problems with it: the dynamic navbar(s) needed some dom manipulation also and there was a black background during the transition. It didn't feel as an intuitive solution.\nTherefor i stopped following the advised approach and just called goBack() two times.\n\nIt would be nice if framework7 itself implemented such a feature.\nGreeting, Martijn\n  http://gate.sinknet.net/\n\nNavigate to Markets, pick anything, and then pick anything again. Then try to go back, and back again, to the root of the menu. You may have to try it a few times... but at some point, the back button breaks on deeply nested content like this. Unsure why... And it doesn't happen consistently.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.\n It seems to always happen the second time going in and back out.\n\nSo, pick Markets, pick anything, pick anything, go back, go back, go back, pick markets, pick anything, pick anything, and go back... and you can't go back again.\n Hmm actually it's not reproducible every time that way. Very frustrating... seems to happen randomly I guess.\n Hmm, okay it does happen, but only if you don't go all the way back out, so if you just go back out twice, instead of three times.\n This will help illustrate the issue.\n\nThe first two times, I navigated all the way back out to the root level. The third time I only navigated back out to the second level. Doing that, it's impossible to then navigate back all the way out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/v/Ur-pwYugfSA&hq=1\n bolshoe spasibo ser :+1: \n @nolimits4web I've been watching this project very closely, if you need to delegate anything. Please let me know! \n Yep, but now our photo galleries are broken... hmmm\n Don't worry... I forgot we had made some changes to the Framework. I cleaned those up and sent a pull request. Issue was unrelated to this ticket. Pull request is here: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/118\n Oops, forgot to close with my comment.\n  It will be really nice if we can have some lazy loading mechanism for loading the images in the media lists only when they become visible on scroll.\n\nSomething like:\nhttps://github.com/luis-almeida/unveil\n\nThis needs a specific Framework7 implementation as onscroll does not work well on iOS devices (it is only fired at the end) and a touchmove event should be used\n\nThis will make the media lists much faster and responsive. As currently when they are pretty large, like 100+ items they are initially very slow because all the images needs to be loaded.\n indeed no custom scrolling but just touchmove should do the trick, it is fired often enough and with the generous offset - like 100px before even entering the view - it should be doable!\n\nCome on Vlad you are the genius :)\n Why doesn't lazy load plugin work with temaplte files?\n  First, Thanks for the awesome work!\n\nI have this problem when display web page in UIWebView.\n\nThis is how it looks when its normal:\n![ios simulator screen shot 9 jul 2014 6 01 52 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/107503/3522766/c8d0c98c-0750-11e4-86c8-17a53c5b9add.png)\n\nBut when keyboard shows, the entire webpage is pushed up, and the navigation bar has gone out of the screen. see image below\n\n![ios simulator screen shot 9 jul 2014 6 01 22 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/107503/3522757/c03e7080-0750-11e4-8f2e-669448be52dc.png)\n\nIs that a bug or just me?\n There is a very hacky approach of triggering an event when the keyboard is up, but that's not an ideal way to solve this problem.\n  This issue happens only on mobile Chrome browser (mostly on Android I think...). The page was like this:\n![screenshot_2014-07-08-14-54-36](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4534745/3515053/d7923534-06d1-11e4-8881-4c757a8dc5b2.png)\n\nThen, if I click on the lower \"E-mail\" input, a white area appears just above the virtual keyboard...\n![screenshot_2014-07-08-14-54-42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4534745/3515052/d791674e-06d1-11e4-8a98-c5af00da6676.png)\n\nThis happens only if the clicked input was on the lower half of the screen. \nAs this is not a normal behavior for an ordinary html input tag, what do you think may cause this problem?\n I would suggest Chrome remote debugging: [https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging] , but there are more ways available, like about:debug [http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5999/android-browsers-aboutdebug-what-do-those-settings-do] or Weinre [http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/Home.html]. \nThank you for the effort!\n Hi,\nI experienced the same behavior on my site as well.

My problem is that the content between navbar and tabbar is fixed when  the content is smaller than the device size. When the user tries to scroll he sees the grey background. With this code: \n$('body').on('touchmove', function (e) {\n         if (!$('.scrollable').has($(e.target)).length) e.preventDefault();\n});\n... I prevented this but the content is fixed and hasnt this bounce effect\n :-( doesn't work but thank you for your help\n Yes I tested on both but doesnt work. But I dont want to interrupt you . Thx\n Yes I'll do, should I close?\n Hey I found the mistake\n1.: 'auto' to auto (you already said)\n2.: .pages to .page\n\nAnd all is ok\nSo right code is:\n<code>\n.page {<br />\n   overflow: auto;<br />\n   -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;<br />\n}<br />\n.page-content {<br />\n   margin-bottom:1px;<br />\n}<br />\n</code>\n This works well with current Framework7 version to eliminate the bounce effect:\n- 1. Download https://github.com/lazd/iNoBounce/blob/master/inobounce.min.js\n- 2. Include script `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/inobounce.min.js\"></script>`\n- 3. Add css to .views container\n\n```\n.views {\n  height: 100%;\n  overflow: auto;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n```\n  I am loading a list with Handlebars template using GET ajax call, but the action sheet callback/button is not working in it.\n\nAlthough it works fine on a static html page which is loaded normally in the same app. \n It's been done in the normal way as it is mentioned in your docs, \n\n<pre> <code> \nvar myApp = new Framework7({\n    init: false,\n    pushState: true,\n    cacheDuration: 1000*60*120, // 120 minutes\n    onAjaxStart: function (xhr) {\n        myApp.showIndicator();\n    },\n    onAjaxComplete: function (xhr) {\n        myApp.hideIndicator();\n    }       \n});\nvar $$ = Framework7.$;\nmyApp.onPageInit('index', function (page) {\n    \n    $$.getJSON(HOST + 'home' , function (data) {\n        var source = $$(\"#home-template\").html();\n        var template = Handlebars.compile(source);\n        var HTML = template({movie: data});\n        $$(page.container).find('.page-content').html(HTML);\n    });  \n    \n});\nmyApp.init();\n// Just After App Initialization \n// on movie page the action buttons are in handlebars template, after which another view is loaded in // the page which contains the list with actions buttons\n// on settings page it is normal html\nmyApp.onPageInit('movie settings', function (page) {\n    $$('.demo-actions').on('click', function () {\n        myApp.actions([\n            // First buttons group\n            [\n                // Group Label\n                {\n                    text: 'Here comes some optional description or warning for actions below',\n                    label: true\n                },\n                // First button\n                {\n                    text: 'Alert',\n                    onClick: function () {\n                        myApp.alert('He Hoou!');\n                    }\n                },\n                // Another red button\n                {\n                    text: 'Nice Red Button ',\n                    red: true,\n                    onClick: function () {\n                        myApp.alert('You have clicked red button!');\n                    }\n                },\n            ],\n            // Second group\n            [\n                {\n                    text: 'Cancel',\n                    bold: true\n                }\n            ]\n        ]);\n    });\n});\n </code> </pre>\n It worked thanks a lot. \n\nI also wanted to share a small suggestion with you, regarding caching. \n\nCurrently if you load \"movie.html?id=123\" and \"movie.html?id=456\" \nIt will treat them differently and load the movie.html file every time the id is different, so the caching works but it loads the same html file again and again. \n\nI did a small change in my code which checks if it is the same html page or not, it works for me and the movie.html file is loaded only once, which makes the application work faster. \nYou can do something like this or something better in the upcoming version. \n\nP.S. Let me know if there is something wrong with this code :)\n\n<code>\n\n```\n    // XHR Caching\n    app.cache = [];\n    app.removeFromCache = function (url) {\n        var index = false;\n        for (var i = 0; i < app.cache.length; i++) {\n            var thisUrl = url.split(\"?\");\n            var cacheUrl = app.cache[i].url.split(\"?\");\n\n            //console.log('Cache Url = ' + cacheUrl);\n            //console.log('this Url = ' + thisUrl);\n\n            if (cacheUrl[0] === thisUrl[0]) index = i;\n        }\n        if (index !== false) app.cache.splice(index, 1);\n    };\n\n    // XHR\n    app.xhr = false;\n    app.get = function (url, callback) {\n        if (app.params.cache && url.indexOf('nocache') < 0 && app.params.cacheIgnore.indexOf(url) < 0) {\n            // Check is the url cached\n            console.log('checking is the url cached');\n            for (var i = 0; i < app.cache.length; i++) {\n\n                var thisUrl = url.split(\"?\");\n                var cacheUrl = app.cache[i].url.split(\"?\");\n\n                //console.log(res[0]);\n                if (cacheUrl[0] === thisUrl[0]) {   \n                    // Check expiration\n                    console.log('url matches & checking expiration for ' + thisUrl[0]);\n                    if ((new Date()).getTime() - app.cache[i].time < app.params.cacheDuration) {\n                        // Load from cache\n                        callback(app.cache[i].data);\n                        return false;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n\n</code>\n   thanks it is where i need..\n  Don't you plan to add support for android native look and feel?\n Check out the new Material Design spec from Google. They are trying to do some cool design stuff as well. Maybe it is worth to implement as theme, as the components are really the same.\n\nSee http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html\n\nThey just announced it at Google I/O\n Well it is a framework that should actually work on all devices, so iOS, Desktop, Android - all different screen sizes. The spec also defines typography and spacing pretty strict as well colors. So you should be able to derive a theme.\n\nBut indeed priority for you should be now to get to stable 1.0 as good base and then add theming :)\n  Hi,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the awesome framework, i'm using it on one of my projects and it is one the easiest and the most lightweight frameworks i've come across for iphone. \n\nI'm working with ajax buttons on a dynamically loaded page. The button works fine on google chrome on pc but it does not respond in safari in iphone. \n\nHere's the javascript of the click event\n\n<pre>\n<code>\n$$('#fav-button').on('click', function (e) {\n    $$(\"#fav-button\").addClass('active');   \n    $$.getJSON( HOST + 'favourite/add/', {film: movie, me: ME}, function( data ) {\n        if(data=='false') {\n            console.log('error in adding to favourites');\n        } else  {\n            console.log('successfully added to favourites');\n        }       \n    });\n});         \n</code>\n</pre>\n\n\nI checked the code multiple times, and found that there seems to be a problem with only the ajax call, when i tap the button in iphone it responds but the ajax call is somehow not made and thus no response is made. Although it works fine in chrome on PC.\n\nI've tried both get and getJSON methods but none seem to respond in safari iphone\n\nAppreciate if anyone can help me out.\n\n<pre>\n<code>\n$$.getJSON( HOST + 'favourite/add/', {film: movie, me: ME}, function( data ) {\n    if(data=='false') {\n        console.log('error in adding to favourites');\n    } else  {\n                console.log('successfully added to favourites');\n    }       \n});\n         \n</code>\n</pre>\n Don't have a mac :( \nOn chrome console it shows no error, can i check it on safari on windows?\n for now i am using it only as a webapp, can you suggest the best way to work with ajax buttons on a page loaded with Ajax, i'll try it again on a clean script and see if it works. \n sorry for the trouble, the problem was with the url, there was a 301 redirect on the url because of which ajax call was not getting complete in mobile safari.\n  Maybe I skip something from documentation ... but anyway I can't find anything about where the icons are ...OR can be use http://ionicons.com/\n thx for quick answer. Super framework !!!\n  Added manual hoisting and single line brackets as debugging aids\n This was quite a bit of work, it would be a terrible shame if it goes to waste.\n In most languages it is easier to read and more memory efficient to declare a variable as close to its use as possible, **in JavaScript however this is not the case.**\n\nPlacing the initial var declaration at the top of a function is actually doing what the parser does any ways.\n\nI do agree that in most languages it reduces readability but in javascript declaring your variables at the top is really just replicating what the parser is doing. Manual hoisting increases readability and helps to prevent certain bugs from occurring; it forces you as well as contributors to pay attention to where and when the var has been declared.\n\nConsider the following (excerpt from _http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-hoisting-explained--net-15092_)\n\n```\nvar myvar = 'my value'; \n\n(function() { \n  alert(myvar); // undefined\n  var myvar = 'local value'; \n})();\n```\n\nOne would normally assume that the alert will show the global var which was defined prior to the function 'my value' but in fact **it will show undefined** due to how javascript handles its variables.\n\nWhat happens is **javascript hoists the myvar declared within the function to the top of the function at runtime** thus preventing access to the global var of the same name, which is why it alerts as undefined.\n\n**This is what javascript is actually doing**\n\n```\nvar myvar = 'my value'; \n\n(function() { \n  var myvar = undefined;   \n  alert(myvar); // undefined\n   myvar = 'local value';\n})();\n```\n\nIn order to prevent the above situation the recommended way to write the above snippet is using the above example showing what happens or as follows:\n\n```\nvar myvar = 'my value'; \n\n(function() { \n  var myvar = 'local value';   \n  alert(myvar); // local value \n})();\n```\n\nRegarding the brackets on the single line commands, as a minimalist I too like to leave them out. However since **this is going to be the greatest mobile framework ever conceived**, adding them as a matter of habit helps prevent bugs which occur from forgetting to add the semicolon (especially when minimizing)\n\nconsider the following\n\n```\nvar a;\nvar b;\n\nif (a===true)\n  alert(a); \nalert(b);\n```\n\nlooks like this compressed\n\n```\nvar a, b;if (a===true)alert(a);alert(b);\n```\n\nNow imagine someone new to javascript forgets the semicolon the following would behave very differently\n\n```\nvar a, b;if (a===true)alert(a)alert(b)\n```\n  This particular dynamic popup issue might be a corner case scenario, however here is the scenario which is causing the problem for us.\n\nWe dynamically create an activity stream which contains photos and videos mixed within the days activities, the goal is to have those photos and videos open in a dynamic popup, however the standard pure html popup code does not properly place the overlay at the end of the document causing it to instead just dim the screen, to remedy this we added the following event\n\n```\n$$(document).on('click', '.create-popup', function () {\n    var $target = $$(this), html = $$($target.data('popup')).html();\n    f7.popup(html);\n});\n```\n\nwhich grabs the popup div and feeds it into the dynamic popup method;  Below is an example of the html it is grabbing.\n\n```\n<a href=\"#activity-videos-popup-{{id}}\" data-popup=\".activity-videos-popup-{{id}}\" class=\"create-popup ui-link\">\n    <img src=\"{{content_data.thumb}}\" class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"{{content_data.caption}}\" />\n</a>\n<div class=\"activity-videos-popup-{{id}}\">\n    <div id=\"activity-videos-popup-{{id}}\" class=\"popup popup-video\">\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"close-popup\">Close</a>\n            <div class=\"select-items\">\n                <div class=\"select-items-head\">\n                    <h3>{{content_data.caption}}</h3>\n                </div>\n                {{getVideoHtml content_data.url}}\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nwe were getting the following error\n\"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'add' of undefined       framework7.js:1811\" after debugging I determined the problem was the hard coded location in the childNodes on line 1810 by looping through the childNodes and looking for the actual div, it fixed this particular problem for us.\n You can use $.trim() function to removes spaces  from the beginning and end of the supplied string.\n Indeed, that is a simpler fix, updated pr\n  Hi Vladimir\n\nIn my app, all language support was implemented in Server using accept-language http header. I used node.js and i18n-2 module. \n\nOn iPhone works fine. If you change the device language, the accept-language of Safari is ok.\n\nUnfortunately, in Android (tested on 4.4.4 Nexus 5) the accept-language seems to be hardcoded in Google Chrome, independently of language of device. I only have an alternative, using javascript navigator.language and moving all multi-language support to the client side.\n\nDo you have plans to support several languages in Framework 7?\n\nNOTE: Firefox in Android works fine, fills accept-language ok.\n Finally I used a cookie that decides if uses a language selected by the user or the system language. \n\nI implemented a settings page where user can select the language that wants (I implemented a few). First option is using the system language (using  navigator.userlanguage || navigator.language) that works perfectly in iOS and Android. \nWhen user change selection I store a cookie with the language, and completely reload main page (node is taking care of the cookie to present the pages in the new one). \n\nIn the html I added attr with the locale of page (also useful to avoid Google translator) and I compare on client side, if the html language matches with the navigator.language (to detect automatically system language and he changed system language settings and change the cookie).\n\nThere is a flicker when I reload main page (I made the change when I press back in setting page) but now I maintain all language support from server instead to move all languages to client side. Fortunately the default option is the interesting one (using system language) so I don't expect the user changes language several times. But I can implement languages that not exists in iphone (Galician for example). \n\nIt's possible to reload all pages (received from Ajax) smoothly to come back to the settings page?\n This is the module lang.js that implement language in client side.\n\n```\n// Cookies routines taken from http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp\n\nfunction createCookie(name,value,days) {\n    var expires;\n    if (days) {\n        var date = new Date();\n        date.setTime(date.getTime()+(days*24*60*60*1000));\n        expires = \"; expires=\"+date.toGMTString();\n    }\n    else {\n        expires = \"\";\n    }\n    document.cookie = name+\"=\"+value+expires+\"; path=/\";\n}\n\nfunction readCookie(name) {\n    var nameEQ = name + \"=\";\n    var ca = document.cookie.split(';');\n    for(var i=0;i < ca.length;i++) {\n        var c = ca[i];\n        while (c.charAt(0)==' ') c = c.substring(1,c.length);\n        if (c.indexOf(nameEQ) == 0) return c.substring(nameEQ.length,c.length);\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\nfunction eraseCookie(name) {\n    createCookie(name,\"\",-1);\n}\n\nvar gLang = navigator.userLanguage || navigator.language;\n\n// using 2 cookies  \n//    sLang=1 means using systemLanguage (if exists)\n//    lang contains the preferred language (filled automatically based in gLang if sLang=1)\n\nfunction setLang(lang) {\n    // lang 0 means system language\n    if (lang==='0') {\n        createCookie('slang','1',30);\n        lang = gLang;\n    }\n    else {\n        eraseCookie('slang','',-1);\n    }    \n    createCookie('lang',lang,30);\n    // lang cookie was changed so I reload completely the F7 \n    // server side will select the new language using cookie lang\n    window.location.reload();   \n}\n\nfunction getLang() {\n    var slang = readCookie('slang')==='1';\n    var lang = readCookie('lang');\n    if (!lang) { \n        setLang('0'); \n    }\n    if (slang && (lang!=gLang)) { // update syslang (changed in settings)\n        setLang('0'); \n    }\n    if (slang) {\n        lang='0';\n    }\n    return lang;\n}\n\n// initial getLang to detect changes in system language\ngetLang();  \n```\n Nice!!

One of the field of the form is a input type=\"text\", that should be autocompleted.\nIt worked in bootstrap, but when I tried to do the same in F7 I found that input is not autocompleted.\n## on the form I added\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&sensor=false\"></script>\n```\n\n---\n## In the form my field is\n\n```\n      <li>\n        <div class=\"item-content\">\n          <div class=\"item-media\"><i class=\"icon icon-form-place\"></i></div>\n          <div class=\"item-inner\">\n            <div class=\"item-title label\">Lugar</div>\n            <div class=\"item-input\">\n              <input id=\"myplace\" type=\"text\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n```\n\n---\n## on the javascript\n\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function (e) {\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n    // other pages initialization\n    if (page.name === 'myform') {\n        function placeChanged() {\n           console.log('placeChanged');\n        }\n        var input = $$('#myplace')[0];\n        var autocomplete = new google.maps.places.Autocomplete(input);\n        google.maps.event.addListener(autocomplete, 'place_changed', placeChanged);\n    }\n## });\n\nFirst (I don't know why) my input included autocomplete=\"off\"  (google added)\nI am receiving the autocomplete info, but it's not filled in the input box.\n\nPD: I include some of your form icons in svg in case that you want to include in Framework 7\n\ni.icon.icon-form-name2 {\n  width: 29px;\n  height: 29px;\n  background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 58 58'><rect fill='%238e8e93' width='58' height='58' rx='10' ry='10'/><path fill='%23fff' d='M6 41v-3l8-4v-2s-1-2-1-3c-1-3-2-7 1-9 1-1 2-2 4-2s3 1 4 2c3 2 3 6 2 9-1 1-2 3-3 3v2l10 4v3h-25zM36 37h17.5v2h-17.5zM32 28h21v2h-21zM29 19h24.5v2h-24.5z'/></svg>\");\n}\n\ni.icon.icon-form-email2 {\n  width: 29px;\n  height: 29px;\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 58 58\"><rect fill=\"%238e8e93\" width=\"58\" height=\"58\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\"/><path fill=\"%23fff\" d=\"M32 36c-1 0-2 1-3 2h-6c0-1-1-2-2-3s-1-3-1-4c0-2 1-4 2-6s2-3 3-4c2-1 3-1 4-1h3c1 1 2 2 2 3l1-3h3l-2 12c-1 1-1 2-1 2v1l1 1 3-1 3-4c1-2 1-3 1-5s0-4-1-5c-1-2-3-3-5-4s-4-2-6-2c-3 0-6 1-8 2s-4 3-5 5c-1 3-2 5-2 8s1 5 2 7 3 4 5 5c3 1 5 1 8 1s6 0 8-1 3-2 4-4h3c0 1-1 3-3 4-1 1-3 2-5 3s-4 1-7 1c-2 0-5 0-7-1l-6-3c-1-1-2-3-3-5s-1-4-1-7c0-2 0-5 1-8 2-3 4-5 6-7 3-2 6-2 10-2 3 0 5 0 7 1 3 2 5 3 6 6 1 2 2 4 2 6 0 3-2 6-4 9-2 2-4 4-7 4l-2-1s-1 0-1-1v-1zm-9-5c0 2 1 3 2 4 0 1 1 1 2 1s1 0 2-1c1 0 2-1 2-1l2-3v-4c0-1 0-3-1-3-1-1-1-2-3-2 0 0-1 0-2 1l-2 2s-1 1-1 3l-1 3z\"/></svg>');\n}\n\ni.icon.icon-form-tel2 {\n  width: 29px;\n  height: 29px;\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 58 58\"><rect fill=\"%238e8e93\" width=\"58\" height=\"58\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\"/><path fill=\"%23fff\" d=\"M10 17c0 8 7 16 12 21 6 5 13 9 21 8l5-6c1-1 1-2 0-3l-7-4c-1 0-2 0-3 1l-3 3c-7-5-10-7-15-13l3-3c1-1 1-2 0-3l-5-7c-1-1-2-1-3 0l-5 6z\"/></svg>');\n}\n\ni.icon.icon-form-calendar2 {\n  width: 29px;\n  height: 29px;\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 58 58\"><rect fill=\"%238e8e93\" width=\"58\" height=\"58\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\"/><path fill=\"%23fff\" d=\"M29 46h-14v-2c0-1 1-2 2-3l4-4 3-2 2-2s0-1 1-1v-2c0-1 0-2-1-3l-1-1c-1-1-2-1-3-1-3 0-4 2-5 5h-2c0-2 1-4 2-5 2-1 3-2 5-2s4 1 5 2 2 3 2 5c0 1 0 2-1 3 0 1-1 2-2 2l-4 4c-3 2-4 3-5 5h12v2zM42 46h-2v-19c-2 2-4 3-6 4v-2c4-2 6-4 7-6h1v23zM27 17h-1v-9l-3 9h-1l-3-9v9h-1v-10h1l3 8 4-8h1zM35 13c0 1 0 2-1 3 0 1-1 1-2 1h-1l-1-1c-1 0-1-1-1-1v-4l1-1 2-1c1 0 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 3zm-1 0v-1c0-1-1-1-1-1 0-1-1-1-1-1-1 0-1 0-2 1v4c1 1 1 1 2 1h1l1-1v-2zM42 17h-1v-6c0-1-1-1-1-1h-1s0 1-1 1v6h-1v-7h1v1c0-1 1-2 2-2s2 1 2 3v5z\"/></svg>');\n}\n\ni.icon.icon-form-place {\n  width: 29px;\n  height: 29px;\n  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 58 58\"><rect fill=\"%238e8e93\" width=\"58\" height=\"58\" rx=\"10\" ry=\"10\"/><path fill=\"%23fff\" d=\"M10 31c1-2 3-3 5-4s4-2 6-1l6-13c-4-2-1-9 3-7l17 8c4 2 1 9-3 7l-7 13c2 1 3 2 4 5 0 2 0 4-1 6 0 1-1 2-2 1l-11-5-8 12c0 1-2 0-1-1l4-13-11-5c-1-1-1-2-1-3zm15-4c0 1 1 2 2 1l5-12c1-1-1-2-1 0l-6 11z\"/></svg>');\n}\n Thank you very much for your excellent support. \n\nYou are right! autocomplete is off in the running example too. There is not error in console. But I prepared 2 sites to show the issue (f7 and bs):\n\nhttp://dni-web.com/f7 \n(your dist example, I changed index.html (to include google api), form.html (to have one item in the form to ask the place), my-app.css (to have icon in svg format) and my-app.js (to handle form). \nGo to Form page.\n\nhttp://dni-web.com/bs\nReally small equivalent bootstrap example that works. When you type in input box, the place is completed using Google API.\n\nI appreciate your comments.\n\nBest regards\nCarlos\n Great. Works perfectly.\nOnce again, you're the best!!\n\nBest regards\n On PC works fine. the Google Popup is shown on top of F7.\nBut when tested in iPhone (5S with iOS 7) I cannot touch on the Google list of places. \nThe keyboard is open. On BS example I still can touch the Google list and select the place, but in F7 site the Google list has useless.\n\nHow can do that?\n The item is now selected, but the input box is not filled with the content of Google list.\nI am not familiarized with F7 source code. It's my first look on it. So maybe the next comment makes no sense:\n\nOn function handleTouchStart you fill the activeSelection. When I am typing in input box, the keyboard popup is expanded (and got the focus). Maybe is this the reason why activeSelection is false, and then the google popup is missing the touches?\n\n```\n        function handleTouchStart(e) {\n```\n\n...\n                if (app.device.os === 'ios') {\n                    var selection = window.getSelection();\n                    if (selection.rangeCount && !selection.isCollapsed) {\n                        activeSelection = true;\n                        return true;\n                    }\n                    else {\n                        activeSelection = false;\n                    }\n\n![img_1010](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1741754/3420713/cef8b474-febc-11e3-89a8-ee149cf6fd25.PNG)\n the console.log('touchend') is never shown. \nI added also a log in touchstart and is not shown neither\n\nit's like pac-container is not receiving touch events\n Now it works!!!!\nVladimir, I cannot say how much I admire you!!!  \n\nThanks a lot\nAll the best \n Hi,\n\nI tried this solution but it does not fire the place_changed event, it makes up touching elsewhere on the screen.

Thank you!\n  I have a page need to without animated page transition.\nIn the doc, I see the \"no-animation\",but it  useless, who can tell me,How should I use it?\n Sorry, i used The v0.8.7, I find it in v0.8.8\n  preprocess returns null value.\n\nwindow.app = new Framework7({\n\n```\n    preprocess: function(content, url, next) {\n        console.log(url);\n        var template = Handlebars.compile(window.mainNavBarTpl + content);\n\n        if (url == 'mainpage.html') {\n            var resultContent = template({\n                title: 'WorkAbroad'\n            });\n            return resultContent;\n        }\n\n\n\n    }\n});\n```\n i change line 1174 null param value to url and it works again, i dont know if this affect other part of update about preprocess \"next\"\npreprocess(data, null, function (data) {\n                    _load(view, url, data, animatePages);\n                });\nto\npreprocess(data, url, function (data) {\n                    _load(view, url, data, animatePages);\n                });\n  I see that you provide support for input type=date \nDo you have plans to support datetime-local  (to select date and time at same time)?. \nIt's native in iOS (as well as date is).\n\nYour work is awesome. \n\nBest regards\n Works perfectly. Fantastic!!!\n  I've installed framework via bower, but there are only \"dist\" folder with concated css files, I don't really need all of these css in my project, is possible to add \"src\" folder with separated .less files for bower?\n  Hello guys just found your framework and very impressed you did a very good job! I took a quick look at UI elements of the framework and didn't find one element which iOS 7 has.

It looks amazing! \n\nJust one question about loading dynamic pages in a view.\n\nWe would like to load a page that is initially empty with loader, that kicks off an Ajax call to load its content. When content arrives the page should be emptied and the loader replaced with the real content. Preferably afterwards we would like also to implement a pull to refresh.\n\nWhat will be the best way to do so? Currently if the page is initially empty and then content is loaded with loadContent it becomes another page .. so the back button returns to the loader page instead of replacing the current...\n\nThanks,\n   George\n I think if the  `view.router` had an API like `replaceContent`(with page name parameter) would be better. \n\nfor example: \n\n``` javascript\n\nvar popupView = null;\nvar cachedUrl = '';\n// pop-up tool\nfunction loadPopupPage(pageUrl) {\n    if( cachedUrl != pageUrl ) {\n        $$.get(pageUrl,function(pageContent){\n            $$('.popup-view').find('.page-content').html(pageContent);\n        });\n    }\n    cachedUrl = pageUrl;\n    myApp.popup('.popup-view');\n}\n\n```\n\nI need to handle the cache myself, if the `view.router` provides `replaceContent` API. so that I can handle the cache via `myApp` 's `cacheDuration` option.\n  Im a newbie i just want to ask how you manage long line of codes  in framework7.\nwhat if i want to make it modular how can i?\nwould you recommend to use require js ?\n    Hey, I found that there are always occasions when I want to jump to a certain page by click rather than by link, and I want to get params in the location, and when I refresh the page, I don't have to go from start, and also, is it possible to get back by physical back button in android? \n Thank you a lot, I will try this.\n This is a great help, but there is a problem. After I gone back from the specified url, and immediately redirect(loadPage) user, it's not happening, even after using on , 'pageinit', 'pageAfter/BeforeAnim', also when you are too deep navigating, mainView.goBack(url) is not going back to the specified url\n  Live Example:http://jsfiddle.net/Belinchung/s97Lb/4/embedded/result/\nQ1.When I open a preloader modal on popup page,The overlay do not appear Because popup and preloader use of the same overlay.\nQ2.When I close the preloader modal by using javascript,At the same time the popup page was closed.\n\nPlease excuse me for my poor English. :(\n  As of iOS 8 and Yosemite...Apple as the use of border-width:0.5px; for 1px on retina displays. It would be nice if this was implemented.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bdc/status/475748427297734656\n Thanks brosif. :)\n  Hello!\nWhen you click on a link, an Ajax call is done and the page is loaded. But in this page, there is Javascript content that can trigger external libraries' content like Highcharts for example.\n\nAre there any way to use Javascript in .html file after an Ajax call loading page ?\n\nThanks for your Framework!\nCloudCompany\n You could do this:\n\n```\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function(e) {\n\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n\n    // Find script tags\n    page.container.getElements('script').each(function(el){\n\n        // External js or inline?\n        if (el.get('src')) {\n\n            // Fetch external js\n            WhateverFramework.load(el.get('src'));\n\n        } else {\n\n            // Evaluate js\n            eval(el.get('text'));\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n The getElements method doesn't exist.\nJavascipt return me an undefined error.\n\nThanks for your reply =)\n Oops, sorry. I am actually using another framework together with F7, and I didn't notice that this code used some of the other framework.\n\nInstead of `page.container.getElements` it's possible you could use `page.container.children`, using the DOM library built into F7 (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/dom.html).\n\nThe equivalent to `WhateverFramework.load(el.get('src'))` would be,\n\nin MooTools:\n`Asset.javascript(el.get('src'))` (http://mootools.net/docs/more/Utilities/Assets)\n\nin jQuery:\n`jQuery.getScript(el.get('src'))` (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/)\n\nIf I had more time, I would rewrite the code to not rely on any other framework, but I hope you get the general idea. I'm not sure if F7 have anything built in to load external javascript.\n This works great with JQuery!\nThank you for your responses Jostein! =)\n\n```\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function(e) {\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n\n    $$(page.container).find(\"script\").each(function(el)\n    {\n        if ($(this).attr('src'))\n        {\n            jQuery.getScript($(this).attr('src'));\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            eval($(this).text());\n        }\n});\n```\n\nCloudCompany\n From that matter the correct script is :\n\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function(e) {\n    var page = e.detail.page;\n\n```\n$$(page.container).find(\"script\").each(function(el) {\n    if ($(this).attr('src')) {\n        jQuery.getScript($(this).attr('src'));\n    } else {\n        eval($(this).text());\n    }\n});\n```\n\n});\n Doesn't work with me, any other solution?

I found that from this popup, if I tried to link to another page, it would not show. After a few hours of investigation, I have found that the page linking works, but only when i use class=\"external\" and that includes no transitions. Is this something that was supposed to be implemented manually? I think that it should be inherit on a different ajax call, all popups, popovers, ect should be removed? \n\nIs this something that could be looked at in the future?\n\nPatrick\n Thank you, \n\nThen I must ask, according to your docs: \n\"By default Framework7 will load all links using Ajax, except links with additional external class (<a href=\"somepage.html\" class=\"external\">) and links with not correct href attribute (when it is empty or #).\n\nThis behavior could be changed by passing ajaxLinks parameter on App initialization\"\n\nThis allows for linking, but removes the transitions. I tried to do item linking (from a dynamically created popup) to another page specific for that item. Is there any way have that?\n\nI had a a-tag with \"class=\"item-link\" and \"href=\"newPage\", but it did not want to seem to transition to it. I did know that right clicking and opening in another tab worked, but even with \"close-popup\" it would not transition in the page because it didn't recognize the view on click (but it was there because you could go to it in another tab).  Not sure what the problem then is. Any ideas? \n\nPatrick\n\nP.S. I abandoned this trial, but would still like to know a solution for future.\n  The slider pagination when nesting a horizontal slider inside a vertical slider appears as a vertical pagination instead of a horizontal.\n\nThe CSS selector for the vertical navigation also targets nested horizontal navigation.\n\nThe problematic selector: (**slider.less**)\n\n```\n.slider-container-vertical .slider-pagination {\n}\n```\n\nThis will also target **.slider-container-vertical .slider-container-horizontal .slider-pagination**\n\nSuggestions:\n- Only select direct child **.slider-pagination** of **.slider-container-vertical**\n- Add **.slider-container-horizontal** to horizontal sliders and target that to style the horizontal slider navigation (instead of **.slider-pagination**)\n\nAlso: awesome framework :-)\n\nEdit: The problem is not only limited to the navigation posititon, but also to **.slider-container-vertical .slider-wrapper** and **.slider-container-vertical.slider-pagination-bullet**\n  I don't know if this is a considered scenario... I tried to put a `view` inside a `popup`. For now, everything seems all good, except the navbar. At the very beginning, the navbar is invisible, unless any window resize happens (or `showNavbar` manually called). What part do you think made the difference? \n  Hi,\nIs there a way to go back to the first page in the navigation history? Kind of similar to the goBack() function?\n  Hi, is it possible to change the title of the alert using the basic alert syntax?\n\n``` javascript\napp.alert('This is the body.', 'This is the title');\n```\n\nor something like this?\n  Currently in F7, if the user click on a `modal-overlay`, the modal would be closed. This is true for almost all modals except alerts, confirms, and prompts.\n\nHowever, sometimes it's necessary to control whether this happens. Like when you popup a login form to require the user to login. \n\nI think this may be achieved by adding a class like `click-to-close` to those modals that need to be closed when clicked. Even just adding a global toggle would be useful.\n\nP.S. \nI'm currently trying to use it with AngularJS in a mobile app project. If it's possible, I would like to release some Angular directives and services to accompany F7 in the near future.\nAgain, thank you for your great job!\n That's useful! Thank you!\n  As discussed in issue #35, adding  a `navbarInit` event would benefit those who integrate F7 with other frameworks (e.g. AngularJS) .\n  Please make it pluggable, focus on its strenghts and integrate it with AngularJS and Cordova-iOS, document iPad functionality a bit better and you will see exploding user numbers. Right now, it is an (although very solid) island, because its UI paradigms cannot be easily decoupled from the business logic, e.g. in a databinding-based Angular app.\n\nCheers,\nSidney\n\nP.S.: Thanks for your great work, your attention to detail in HTML5/CSS3 integration of native UI attributes is inspiring!\n Ok so it's normal if it simply shows a blank page when trying to use it with ember.js?\n\n+1\n hi guys! at first thanks for a good job, f7 looks really great!\nthis question about integration with mvc frameworks (eg backbone) is really important for me at the moment, as i would like to use f7 along with backbone, so could you please tell approximate estimation when it can be done? thanks in advance!\n Can't wait to use this with backbone!\n +1\n Will framework7 play nicely with Phonegap?\n +1 backbone (and other MV*) niceties \n Has this been considered with the release of \"Framework7 v0.9.7 - Updated on October 7, 2014\" ?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI think i found my solution:\nhttp://www.idangero.us/framework7/tutorials/mobile-mvc-apps-with-framework7-requirejs-and-handlerbars.html#.VD_N6PmSx8E\n\nNot exactly backbone. But in the right direction. Will try get them working together.\n @nolimits4web Awesome I look forward to it. \n\nIf anyone else is interested what I've done to get it working with Marionette is to add rel=\"external\" to any links that I want to hijack with my backbone router then in the marionette controller I create my marionette views, load data, add it to the DOM as per normal but inside a hidden framework7 page. Finally i then use Framework7s javascript methods to show the page with its transitions. I keep my framework7 object as a child of my App object so I can use all the functionality when needed in any marionette view.\n\nAmazing framework btw\n Sure I'll upload some examples this week some time\n @DustinJSilk Have you managed to upload some examples? I am also struggling with Framework7 + Marionette.\n +1\n @psychonelo I havent my apologies. It wasn't easy getting it to all work together. Using both together seemed to cause various framework7 components to break down one after the other so it was a hack the whole way through the project. I'm not going down this route again but rather building my own animations and interactions with stand alone plugins and a raw backbone+marionette+require project. Hopefully sometime this framework will get updated to be compatible with other MVC frameworks.\n What is the status for MV\\* compatibility now?\n Hi guys,\n\nI've made a bundle using Backbone - Marionette and Framework7 work together.\n\nYou can find the bundle with an exemple app here : https://github.com/Under-Warz/backbone-marionette-framework7\n\nI've also made a Yeoman's Generator to create the app and the crossplatform part (with cordova) here : https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-clintcross\n\nIt wasn't easy to make all things work together at start due to the Backbone's router and the Framework7's router but I made it.\n\nPlease give me your feedback and ask questions if needed :)\n  Hello,\n\nI would like to offer you to change viewport scaling. Right now, using 1 as scale moves the sidebar gestures to more 2px at a time. Safari has a bug, in iOS, in retina displays. It doubles the pixel count. Therefore using 0.5 as a scaling will solve this problem, and it will make the swipe gestures and effects run more smoothly.\n\nProposed replacement is:\n\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=0.5, minimum-scale=0.5, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui\">\n```\n\nAlso, CSS should change.\n  Hey, I found that there is no switch for slider auto play, should you add this?\n great!\n  Hey, I found that on my android web browser, the switch form element toggled back when  I click it, it seems click fired twice, Is there a way to fixed this?\n  i try to use todo7 sample app to gingerbread and it is not working?\n ok thanks . and thanks for this great framework :D\n  I tried this framework for memory leak inside pageinit events i use this\n\n$$(document).on('pageInit', function (e) {\n  var page = e.detail.page;\n  alert('init');\n  $$('#test').on('click', function () {\n        alert(\"n times\")\n  });\n});\n\nthe good thing is #test click only trigger once.\n\nQ. where does the garbage collection has beed processed? is it on page change?\n  Hey,\nIs there a specific search bar element I can add? If so, am I able to search a tableview like I can in iOS?\n Alright, sweet. Thanks for all the hard work. :)\n Thanks brosif!\n  Here is a possible bug:\n\nIf I am viewing a tab and then navigate to another tab and I open a item content-link to another page then go back and visit another tab. Now, if I go back to the tab that has the item-content link then the link doesn't work. \n\nThat is a lot to follow so here it is again:\n\n_Viewing tab_ --> _Navigate to another tab_ --> open an item-content link to another page within the tab --> _navigate back_ --> the link doesn't work any more\n\n`<li><a href=\"ios4.html\" class=\"item-link item-content link\">\n              <div class=\"item-media\"><img src=\"images/icon.png\" width=\"44\"/></div>\n              <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                <div class=\"item-title-row\">\n                  <div class=\"item-title\">Title</div>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"item-subtitle\">subtitle</div>\n              </div></a></li>`\n When I navigate to the third tab and click logout button (content-link to login.html),The login page has been load to the first tab content and the screen stay in the third tab.the right thing is the screen should change and stay in the first tab.what should I do?\n @nolimits4web There are a live example in http://m.hiliaox.com/\n\nThat is a lot to follow so here it is again:\nlogin -> navigate to \"setting\" tab -> click \"logout\" button \n\nThe login.html has been load in \"OurView\" content,But  the screen stay in setting tab.\n @nolimits4web Thanks.\nMaybe @matthewball has the same question as I do.\n @nolimits4web \n\n```\n$$('.tabbar .tab-link').eq(0).trigger('click');\n//$$('.tabbar .tab-link').eq(0).click();\n```\n\nI found it does not work on touch devices.  :(\n For me, I am still having issues with the panels not linking after visiting another page.\n Sorry, I have been waiting for my app to be published on app store but you can see for yourself here: \n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4137517/3075505/d70eba5c-e37b-11e3-9d92-72fd95374756.png)\n  Hi, I find that bootstrap scrollspy is very impressive, but I'm not able to move it on f7 apps,  I think it is because of scrollspy use id links, say, <a href=\"#link1\".

I'm impressed.\n\nI would like to propose a change in the behavior of pull to refresh. In newer apps made by Apple, you don't have to actually let go to start loading. When you drag down enough it will automatically start the loading, and then you can let go whenever you want.\n\nI think that it's better because it starts the loading earlier and thus makes the app feel more responsive.\n Hmm, I thought that all newer Apple apps used this and that this was \"the new way to do it\". I might be wrong thought. Would be nice if we can add in a simple option for this :)\n Hi all - the behavior that Linus is talking about is the built-in behavior\nof the UIRefreshControlhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIRefreshControl_class/Reference/Reference.htmlelement.\nLike mentioned, you don\u2019t see this behavior in Twitter and\nFacebook because they implement their own, custom refresh control.\n\nThe native UIRefreshControl is probably one of the most difficult\nanimations to replicate, even if the refresh-without-letting-go\ncharacteristic is not. I think that since the Framework7 pull-to-refresh\nimplementation is closer to what you might see in Twitter or Facebook, we\nshould leave it as it is.\n\nNice work again on your awesome framework!\n iOS8 does tweak these animations slightly (and in a difficult to emulate with JS/CSS kinda way) so I recommend closing this and revisiting this when iOS8 launches.\n  We're trying out a sample integration with this interesting framework -- and we've had to rename all the 'view' and 'view-main' class usages to 'view-f7' and 'view-f7-main'. \n\nThe 'view' class is already a frequently used one and was conflicting -- you might consider using a more specific name or allowing the class to be customized on app init. \n  Hey, I catch this problem. In the kitchen-sink,I include the jquery lib and  I add an input with id=\"txt\" in list-view.html, and in kitchen-sink.js, I add the code below \n'''\n    if (page.name === 'list-view') {\n        console.log(\"hellow\");\n        $(\"#txt\").blur(function(e){\n        console.log(\"hellow\");\n            if($(this).val().trim()===''){\n                $(this).focus();\n                myApp.alert(\"You should input something\");\n                }\n        });\n    }\n'''\nsomething bad happen, it run into an infinite loop!!\n Hi,I think your advice is very meaningful and I take it. for this prolem,\nif I change myApp.alert to native alert, it actually function well as\nexpected, and I debugged in chrome console, when it comes to myApp.alert,\nit just get in and never get out.\n\n2014-04-19 22:08 GMT+08:00 Vladimir Kharlampidi notifications@github.com:\n\n> Everything is ok with custom alert.

I have other questions however. In my starter page, how can I hide my navbar and toolbar ? If I totally remove div class=\"navbar\" on starter page, the navbar never appear on other pages although I add div class=\"navbar\" in other pages, please help me with this, thanks a lot.\n Great! I really appreciate for your kindness reply, I like this wonderful framework.\n  This is a well done framework (in the very early stages). However, I decided to use framework7 for one of my projects and I wanted to integrate it with angularJS. The difficulty I faced is combining page transitioning/changing from both frameworks. Angular uses ng-view and Framework7 similarly (with partial html) changes pages except for top navbar and bottom navbar. \n\nHelp/Advice on how to control the navigation of pages in Framework7 with AngularJS routes, templates would be very useful.\nThank you.\n Hey guys, just found this framework and it looks pretty amazing...\nJust searched Github for Framework7 + angularjs and found this question.\n\nI'd not say I'm an angular pro, but I'm coding an angular hybrid app for ipad since January, so maybe I can answer your question.\nAt the moment I didn't look at any code of the framework7s javascript, but it's not really ease to integrate a framework with so many javascript components into angular. Since when you use angular, you don't want to use massive dom manipulation, that is not handled by angular its self.\n\nFor routing, templates and animating this stuff, I can recommend the [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)\n\nIf anyone else will write a sort of angularjs port/connector of framework7, would be nice to hear, I'm definitely interested in it.\nBut maybe the [ionic framework](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) is what people will use when they want ios7-looking-components with angularjs.\n\n@nolimits4web don't get me wrong, I think you guys did/do an amazing job here, hope documentation is coming soon :)\n Hi @nolimits4web , thanks for the fast reply. before i start explaining why i would prefer to use angularjs, i have not yet seen any documentations for Framework7 but i'm looking forward to it. \n\nAngularJS:\n- provides two way binding: an intelligent way of sharing data between the model and the view. See http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding\n- stateful hash urls so refreshing application brings you back\n- consumes and manipulate data easily via api\n- client side templating. here i am not referring to jade, since jade is processed server side, this limits what i can do on the client side. \n- backed by google. on top of the corporate support it enjoys from google, it also has a large community. This is extremely valuable.\n\nTake a look at the angular, its easy to get started. Hope this gives you some insight on to why i was trying to integrate framework7 with angular.\n +1 for AngularJS support.\n\nAs AngularJS dev  I have to admit that Ionic is what I always dreamed but the UI and the look & feel of framework7 UI seems much much (much much) better. Awesome job!\n +1 for AngularJS support.\n\nAlways dreaming of a artistic mobile UI framework for AngularJS apps. \n cnjsstong2: your dream might become reality. Follow me on G+ and you might have some surprises in the next weeks ;)\n @nolimits4web : no no.. I meant we are developing a new UI framework with a lot of ready-to-use AngularJS creative components/directives/utilities based on ThreeJS, HTML5 Canvas, D3 and many others interesting libraries.\n\nSo I would be very happy if Framework7 will support AngularJS because our framework might be used with it too : )\n @nolimits4web IMO maybe we need mvc just to separate modules and data , the routing of f7 is solid but there is no model part it is so hard to manage the project if all codes and webservice inside app.js? \n @nolimits4web That would be wonderful!\n @nolimits4web: perfect!\n I am currently integrating F7 with AngularJS. I chose non-invasive approach using already defined hooks like \"pageInit\" event etc. I am using built in F7 router focusing only on DI, databinding and more semantic directives etc. leaving routing, dom manipulation, animations etc. to F7. \n\nI manage to make progress but I stuck with dynamic navbar - the problem is that you don't provide any \"hooks\" for navbar manipulation - navbar DOM manipulation is inside _load private function and there are no triggered events.\n\n<strong>So, It would be great if you could provide triggers for navbars just like for pages in _load.</strong>\nFor example like this (i inserted it in _load function):\n\n```\nif (dynamicNavbar) {\n   newNavbarInner.addClass('navbar-on-right');\n   navbar.append(newNavbarInner[0]);\n\n   app.navbarInitCallback(navbar, newNavbarInner[0]); // added navbarInitCallback\n}\n```\n\nJust for example navbarInitCallback simplistic form of navbarinitCallback:\n\n```\napp.navbarInitCallback = function (navbar, navbarInner) {\n   ....\n   $(navbar).trigger('navbarInit', navbarInner);\n};\n```\n Perfect. With hooks like this I can make Angular and F7 work like a charm - using the best of both worlds. \n(And actually I am quite happy with F7 routing and page loading - I think Angular ui-router or ngRoute are not necessary for Hybrid apps  and most mobile web apps)\n\nBTW - Both pure Angular frameworks for mobile (ionic and onsen) are jokes comparing to F7 - I'd rather spend time for integration F7 w. Angular then using any of them. Great Job!!!\n @nolimits4web : Honestly - I'm not sure if it's necessary. First - it would require a lot of work from you and probably also on Angular side. I like idea of integrating with Angular via callbacks from F7 and using F7 routing, transitions, animations - they work very nice. Also, I think it would not solve all problems and would make rather complicated stack. Routing in mobile apps is not so complicated that we need all states, named views etc. - stuff that is provide by Angular UI-Router and is a must for complex web apps.\nBut, I don't know F7 very well and I just started integrating it with Angular - so far I am quite happy with results (I can use Dependency Injection, Data Binding, Services etc and it's enough... for now. I will let you know when I ancounter problems and when I will have clear idea about best integration scenario. I will publish my solution with demo app in a couple of weeks.\n @nolimits4web Hi, I'm currently also trying to integrate Framework7 with AngularJS. I'm keeping F7's page loading and wrapping views and pages into directives, and will try to make a customized routing later. So far everything seems so good. I just wonder if it's possible for you to add an animation toggle to the `app.loadPage(view, url, pushstate)` function? Something like `app.loadPage(view, url, pushstate, animate)` in which `animate` is a boolean would be wonderful. Thank you for the excellent work!\n And +1 for @yoorek , a `navbarInit` event would be extremely helpful for integrating with AngularJS!\n @nolimits4web sounds great. I recently tried out integrating it with meteor. Since you are using these \"live-events\" all over, it works just fine (exept for some smaller issues). Somehow connecting F7 and iron-router would propably be the only challenge.\n @cnjsstong2 can you please enlighten us the newbie how di you implement it in angular hehe thanks :)\n I think when we do AngularJS integration, an easy way would be to use F7's page loading and somehow routing. For now, as we've got `pageInit` and `navbarInit` events, we can do something after a page gets loaded. \n\nAfter F7 loads a page, we need to `$compile` the HTML and link it with an Angular `scope`. If there is some mechanism to share a `scope`(which can be treated as an JavaScript object) between `onPageInit` and `onNavbarInit` hooks, or just make sure both hooks are executed in synchronized order, it would be better. Maybe add a `onPageAndNavbarInit` hook?\n And for Angular users, I don't see it a good idea to integrate F7 with existing `angular-route` or `angular-ui-route`, as they are so different in basic concepts of routing. It might be necessary to build some specialized routing service like `angular-f7-route`... So I think it would be useful if there are some mechanism for the plugins to access the location history of a view.\n Hiya\n\nAlso trying to use angular in combination with framework7, but not yet so much familiar with both frameworks. Essentially I want to use the controllers (with the databinding) and some services as an enhancement to framework7.\n\nIn my application bootstrapping is set up to first load the framework7 App and then any (angular) logic+data - idea is to have the views set up as quickly as possible for the user. This means that angular is loaded after the framework7 app is created; thus the plugin couldnt be used. But it would momentarily seem as if the plugin isn't necessary as the hooks for `navbarInit` and `pageInit` suffice.\n\nAs I see it, the dynamic loading of angular resources on page loads requires using the navbar and page init hooks - in navbarInit angular compilation fails for the page-dom (page-dom not yet inserted (?)), in pageinit the navbar is not available. _I would suggest, also passing the navbar object during the pageInit event_ which would make it simpler and makes sense as navbar and page belong together.\n\nSharing angular scopes is not necessarily a big issue in itself as it can in principle easily be done using some angular factory. But a question would be wether and how to manage the different scopes for different framework7 view stacks as not to pollute/leak scope data into scopes where it does not belong\n\nTo share some example (testing) code for any other developers looking into the same issue\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/tschiemer/d30973454467ff08d6dc\n Hi, \nDoes the 1.0.0 release enable us to use f7 with angularjs ?https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/e4f701176d24c5896f8b290ce71a7bae2db38a54\n @nolimits4web Sweet I will give it a go. \nIf you come across some tutorial or even template project using F7 and angular, could you please post the links over here.\n I had the same doubt, but then I found the following solutions!\n\nUse template7\nhttp://www.idangero.us/template7/\n\nReally, nobody ever found this demo?\nhttps://github.com/valnub/Framework7-with-AngularJS-demo-app\n Hi guys! I'm using F7 for a while and now want to integrate angular just for data binding etc. \nIn the index.html page everything is working as expected. However if i open another html page (in the same view) just by clicking an anchor tag. All Angular Magic stops working.\n\nHas anybody else had this issue? Thanks!\n @pruimmartin Try template7 with pageInit callbacks\n It is time to close this issue as there are many examples of how to use both\n Try this.. https://github.com/ashvin777/framework7.angular it is under development but can we used for framework7 and angularjs combination. Cheers !!\n I'm currently **also** integrating F7 with AngularJS. I create a custom F7 Router for angular very similar to ngRoute like this:\n\n```\n$Router()\n  .when('#/', {\n    name: 'Showcase',\n    controller: 'ShowcaseController',\n    controllerAs: 'vm',\n    templateUrl: 'showcase.view.html'\n  })\n  .when('#/product', {\n    name: 'Product',\n    controller: 'ProductController',\n    controllerAs: 'vm',\n    templateUrl: 'product.view.html'\n  })\n  .when('#/register', {\n    name: 'Register',\n    controller: 'RegisterController',\n    controllerAs: 'vm',\n    templateUrl: 'register.view.html'\n  })\n```\n\nAnd it works! \nI will give more news soon ;D\n Hello Guys,\n\nTry the working demo(Kitchen-sink-app) of Framework7 along with AngularJS at below URL\nhttp://ashvin777.github.io/framework7.angular/kitchen-sink-material/#!/home.html\n\nGithub Repo\nhttps://github.com/ashvin777/framework7.angular\n Hi,\r\n\r\nI configured environment service for F7 along with AngularJS project, At last, I need to inject the envService as a module to the project. Can anyone help me on how to inject the module in F7\r\n\r\nI tried like this,\r\n MyApp.config.$inject=['envService'];\r\nMyApp.angular.module('MyApp').factory('UrlConfig',config);\r\n\r\nThanks & Regards,  Hey, not really an issue, but I'm wondering if it's possible to open a Popup/Modal by passing a HTML string instead of passing a HTML/DOM object?\n\nBasically, the problem that I'm having is that I'd like to open different popups on different subpages loaded via AJAX, but as far as I can see I can only insert .popup markup into the main page, but not pages that load asynchronically?\n\nThank you!\n Thanks for adding it in the future! For now I'm using a workaround close to your suggestion.\n\nI'm adding \"empty\" popup markup into the main page's markup, and use the `onPageAfterAnimation` event to add the contents to the empty popup DOM nodes after the page animation has finished.\n\nWorks for me, but it's kinda inconvenient.\n\nNonetheless, thanks for the great framework! :heart_eyes:\n Coolio, thanks!\n  When I embed F7 into UIWebView it detects device.status bar and adds with-statusbar-overlay class to body and looks like;\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-05 20 26 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/175735/2623351/aeb80efa-bce8-11e3-81ab-aa7096650542.png)\n\nBut I think I can detect UIWebView and iOS version 7 then change `.navbar height` from 44px to 64px and set `padding-top:20px;` to navbar-inner then it should be seen like this,\n\n![screenshot 2014-04-05 20 30 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/175735/2623352/aee63140-bce8-11e3-9574-7b277f04c2af.png)\n\nBtw, `device.webview = !!navigator.standalone;` returns false in UIWebView. But I able to detect UIWebView by checking User Agent. What do you think?\n Oh, I can't see `<div class=\"statusbar-overlay\"></div>` in the native webview. But according to your explanation about pages without navbar your approach is right. \n\nBut it still can't detect the native webview :) I'm going to send a PR for this.\n Yes, everything is well. I also removed my old fork and re-forked again for future updates. :)\n\nThanks!\n So does this help me if l am using iPhone 4s\n  A new pull request as we discussed on https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/30\n Yes, I just synced with your upstream about half an hour ago :) And yes, only three of them I updated.\n For the 1st, i don't know what I thought :) probably i left [0] there on copy paste or something, rest is fine.\n\nI'm using iframes in some speacial cases(I know iframes are too old-school way to use). I created subEvents to detect swipe gestures on iframes. Parent views can't handle touches when you are using full sized iframes in pages. I used it only in <code>_load</code> because it should be enabled only active(can touchable) views. \n\nIt's not a solution for general requirements, if you don't want to enlarge the framework you can simply skip that part. :)\n  As discussed in #29, here is my tour of what I found slow in the Kitchen Sink. It\u2019s running on an iPhone 3GS, in an \u201capp\u201d pinned to the homescreen, so no Nitro JS engine, really putting Framework7 to stress.\n\nAgain, I haven\u2019t looked into the source code. A recurring theme is that elements that need to track touch are the slowest to respond. Those perform better in Safari.\n\nSorted by descending slugishness, more or less:\n## Swipe back\n\nThose are really slow when they\u2019re under your fingers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb15tIcZ_rY\n\nOnce released, the animation is okay though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNUHA_h3YYM\n## Slider\n\nReally slow, and the fact that this element is pretty easily missed by your finger doesn\u2019t help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N-umyLUQxo\n## Swipe to delete\n\nPretty slow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_3reKI-Dkc\n\nIt looks like it\u2019s a bit less slow when they\u2019re tiny, might just be an illusion though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKD7snR0vVA\n## Pull to refresh\n\nFor some reasons, the first one or two pulls are pretty laggy, after that they\u2019re acceptable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHG7SJEGFiU\n## Form inputs\n\nI guess you\u2019re aware of this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbsCjiilC9g\n\nThe known solution is https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick; but it\u2019s probably not worth it to merge FastClick into Framework7.\n## Switch\n\nThe switch feels a bit slow to respond without the nice iOS\u00a07 effects\u00a0: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxdz4R71byE\n\nI think setting the border to green (or grey if it\u2019s already checked) on touchstart might do the trick.\n## Scroll\n\nScroll is a bit less responsive than normally, for some reason this is the thing from this list that bothers me the less: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS06O3JoNGo\n\nRegular scrolling in Safari on a simple website, for comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9W3howFo2Q\n The iPhone 3GS is a 5 year old device - most iPhone users today are running iOS7 on at least an iPhone 4, most are on 4S or 5. Also, iOS7 is available only for Retina Devices (iPhone 4+). Please do not waste energy in the \"Rat Race\" trying to support old/deprecated devices (this is also the approach Ionic is using very effectively, as they just secured 1m $ in funding)\n\nPlease focus on developing new, heavily required features which are currently holding back widespread adoption of Framework7, such as out-of-the-box, perfect integration with AngularJS and / or Cordova. \n @SidneyS +1 Yes! Absolutely!\n I too think the 3GS shouldn\u2019t be bothered with. I think iPhone 4 and up should though.\n\nHere are some stats: http://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/#iphonebreakdown\n\nNon-retina screens must unfortunately be taken into account because of iPads, half of them aren\u2019t retina.\n\nAnother interesting tidbits I got from those stats (mirrored by Apple\u2019s App Store stats https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/) is that iOS 6 isn\u2019t used much anymore. At last year\u2019s WWDC Tim Cook showed iOS 6 at 93%, this year at pretty much the same time iOS\u00a07 is at 88%.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked much into how Framework7 works actually (just got excited by the demo), so I\u2019m not making any suggestion as to what is most pressing for the framework.\n  Normally navigation system keeps only two active pages and navbars in DOM tree. I believe this behavior was intentionally designed for performance issues. But if you are creating dynamic contents or pages and push them into navigation stack by <code>view.loadContent</code> you can't keep the older and older views in DOM tree. \n\nFor instance; you have a registration form by 5 different steps (different html contents), you will obtain and submit all form data at the end of wizard. Currently, you can't because once you passed the page, all entered values are gone! \n\nThat's why we need to keep pages and all related DOM elements in document tree while you were navigating deep pages.\n\nYou can simply enable caching by passing <code>{ domCache:true }</code>  to viewParams parameter of <code>app.addView</code>.\n Well, think that im pushing an iframe(or any other loading dom element) in every single page. Once I pushed third page in to chain, first page will be detached from document tree and when I swipe back F7 will append 1st page's element while it preloads. At that time all loading events(onload/onerror etc.) will be fired again. \n\nThis behavior can be acceptable in according to architectural design of F7. But there must be an option to do that without pain :)\n\nBTW, do you still need a new PR for that?\n\nThanks.\n  Hi,\n\nWhen doing the \u201cswipe from the left of the screen\u201d gesture on my iPhone 3GS, the text looks bad.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked at the source code, but it seems you are using transforms, and `translate` transforms work with subpixels value, no rounding. I guess this is the root of the problem.\n\nLooks good: http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/14/1396356309-image-1.png\nLooks bad, blurry: http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2014/14/1396356305-image.png\n\nI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s worth fixing though, I guess most users won\u2019t stare at all the animations like I do. :) And non-retina iPhones [apparently aren\u2019t really that popular these days](http://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/) anyway and it\u2019s only going to go down from there. But I thought I\u2019d let you know, in case you weren\u2019t aware of this.\n\nIn case you\u2019d like to fix that, I think the solution would be to round `translateX` to the nearest integer when `devicePixelRatio` is 1.\n\nBy the way, mandatory congratulations: I\u2019m very impressed with how faithful this is to iOS 7. I didn\u2019t thought this level of fidelity was possible. And I\u2019m on an iPhone 3GS, I thought it would be slow as shit but it\u2019s actually very correct, Kitchen Sink is more responsive than some native apps on this 2009 phone. (If that would be useful, I could open another issue specifying every things that are slow in the kitchen sink on the 3GS).\n All right, will do!\n  i write a page show messages,in the pageinit method i want ajax call the data service and add message to the page,but it not work,it seem only when the page change the pageinit method will call.\n\n```\n<div class=\"view view-main\">\n              <div class=\"navbar\">\n          <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n            <div class=\"center sliding\">Message Board</div>\n            <div class=\"right\"></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n            <div class=\"pages navbar-through\">\n                <div data-page=\"messages\" class=\"page no-toolbar toolbar-fixed\">\n                    <div class=\"page-content messages-content\">\n                        <div class=\"messages\">\n                            <div class=\"messages-date\">\n                                Sunday, Feb 9, <span>12:58</span></div>\n                            <div class=\"message message-sent\">\n                                Message</div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n```\n How can I use `$$` before initialising the app, as from the examples I've seen in kitchen sink, you get '$$' by doing:\n\n```\nvar $$ = myApp.$;\n```\n\nI've tried doing `Framework7(document).on...` and that failed with **Cannot set property '_animFrame' of undefined**\n \u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435. \n\n\u0422\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b (\u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c AJAX-\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441), \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e:\n\n```\nTypeError: $$ is undefined\n$$.ajax({\n```\n\n\u041a\u043e\u0434 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439:\n\n```\ndocument.addEventListener('pageInit', function (e) {\n    page = e.detail.page;\n    if (page.name === 'index') {\n        $$.ajax({\n            ...\n        })\n    }\n});\n\n// Initialize app\nvar myApp = new Framework7();\n```\n\n\u0417\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430: \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c AJAX-\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0438 index-\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b, \u0442.\u0435. \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439.\n I solve this issue this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyApp.onPageInit('home', function (page) {\r\n\t//functions\r\n}).trigger();\r\n``` I remember having the same problem, and I've solved like @pedropamn , using .trigger();  I just added loadContent method and related helpers to view\u2019s class for\nloading predefined or pre-rendered DOM elements as a page.\n First of all thank you for the cool framework! \n\nActually I planned to use loadContent with a DOM object instead of raw strings. But this option can also be added by simply checking parameter type. \n\nFor the history/routing question, it stores content based pages in view's contentCache then it app uses those elements while navigation going back. But I didn't tried such kind mixed routings like generated page -> loaded page -> generated page. \n\nLet me check it and get back to you :)\n Just pushed the patch that we discussed above and now I realized that another missing feature like loading/parsing javascript on ajax based pages.\n\nDo you have any plan to do that?\n Oh, sorry to late answer. I missed the notification :) \n\nI've some ideas about loading those kind of files for ajax views but I think you are right. It will be better to keep logic in main script file.\n\nOn the other side, I did some other improvements and extra features for content based pages. Now I'm planning to add some compatibility for mvc libraries like marionette. Do you have any roadmap or development plan for those kind of things? I personally would love to help to develop F7 :)\n I did another pulll request for the new content related features.\n\nI can't say something certain about MVC integrations because I didn't decided on a way of integration. But yes, I have some ideas for optimum performance and less changes on framework. Be sure that once I did a success, I'll keep you posted. \n  Animations on Nexus5 (Chrome) look very bad (incredibly slow).\n I don't know what you (or Google) have done, but it's much snappier now. I guess (somehow) hardware acceleration is now supported in Framework7 and/or Chrome for Android. Great job, thanks!\n  Hello all,\nIv been trying to get my head wrapped round this piece of gold for a couple days and its slowly coming together.\n\nI am stuck with one thing though, and even after a blatant copy/paste from kitchen-sink, its not working. I feel kindof bad asking such a simple question here after seeing what you guys talk about but, theres no manual yet and I have to learn this...\n\nIm looking to basically copy kitchen-sink's right panel. Have a item-list which, when clicked, opens the page within the panel...\n\nHere is my code, of just the right-panel obviously:\n\n```\n  <div class=\"pages navbar-through\">\n    <div data-page=\"panel-right1\" class=\"page\">\n      <div class=\"page-content\">\n        <div class=\"content-block\">\n          <p>Right side panel</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"list-block\">\n          <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"panel-right2.html\" class=\"item-link\">\n              <div class=\"item-content\">\n                <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                  <div class=\"item-title\">Right panel page 2</div>\n                </div>\n              </div></a></li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- END OF PANEL RIGHT -->\n```\n Ah.. Yes i forgot to surround my pasted code so it removed some of it. haha\n\nHere it is again - correctly pasted:\n\n```\n<div class=\"panel panel-right panel-reveal\">\n    <div class=\"view view-right\">\n      <div class=\"navbar\">\n        <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n          <div class=\"left\"></div>\n          <div class=\"center sliding\">Right Panel</div>\n          <div class=\"right\"></div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"pages navbar-through\">\n        <div data-page=\"panel-right1\" class=\"page\">\n          <div class=\"page-content\">\n            <div class=\"content-block\">\n              <p>Right side panel</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"list-block\">\n              <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"panel-right2.html\" class=\"item-link\">\n                  <div class=\"item-content\">\n                    <div class=\"item-inner\">\n                      <div class=\"item-title\">Right panel page 2</div>\n                    </div>\n                  </div></a></li>\n                  </ul>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n```\n Yes! It was the JS... I had an extra bracket or two in there...\nThank you so much!\n\nOn another note, is there a better forum for asking question related to F7? ...Doesn't seem right making an new \"issue\" every time someone has a question related to their own code and not F7's code. (Like I just did)\n Great.\nThanks again for this. I think you have just opened up some serious alternative to xCode, Obj-C and Apples $99 development cost :D \n  Just fixed a typo. \n  The example code needs a div wrapped around panel and view and then some css to take care of x scroll\n\n```\n.app {\nwidth: 100%;\nheight: 100%;\noverflow-x: hidden;\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0;\nright: 0;\nbottom: 0;\nleft: 0;\n}\n\n\n<div class=\"app\">\n<!-- Views-->\n<div class=\"views\">\n  <!-- Your main view, should have \"view-main\" class-->\n  <div class=\"view view-main\">\n    <!-- Top Navbar-->\n    <div class=\"navbar\">\n      <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n        <div class=\"left\">Menu</a></div>\n        <div class=\"center sliding\">Title</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- Pages, because we need fixed-through navbar and toolbar, it has additional appropriate classes-->\n    <div class=\"pages navbar-through toolbar-through\">\n      <!-- Page, data-page contains page name-->\n      <div data-page=\"index\" class=\"page\">\n        <!-- Scrollable page content-->\n        <div class=\"page-content\">\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n    <!-- Panels overlay-->\n<div class=\"panel-overlay\"></div>\n<!-- Left panel with reveal effect-->\n<div class=\"panel panel-left panel-reveal\">\n  <div class=\"list-block\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n```\n  Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#box-shadow\n The box-shadow is animating on iOS 6 and 7, and the current Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.

I apologize for bothering you guys, I really do feel like kind of a jackass that I can't seem to figure this out on my own and if it's not too much trouble I have just two questions that I am confident are RTFM answers.\n\n1) In the readme it is indicated that a server needs to be running in order to use the application to support the ajax calls the app makes. Must this server remain the node.js server, or can I use my existing rails application to power this application? If I am able to use my existing rails app (which would, of course, be highly preferred), how best do I query the application using the Framework7 ajax library?\n\n2) Regarding deployment, is it safe to consider this framework a non-native web application that is simply amazingly responsive, beautiful, and **exactly** matches the iOS 7 style? Or is this a framework in the spirit of PhoneGap or Cordova that runs natively on the device?\n\nAgain, I am _very_ sorry that these questions seem so inept. It's been a really long few weeks at work and I'm burnt out. I just felt the compelling need to ask because I needed only look at the website for 30 seconds before I realized just how many things I can use this for in my day-to-day that would make my life so much better.\n\nI really appreciate any assistance you can provide! Thank you!\n\nPierce\n Don't feel bad there's no manual yet to RTFM.  :)\n\nMy understanding is that any HTTP server will work. You should be able to use your Rails app as the backend server, since I do myself.\n\nAs for \"how to query the application\", you should simply link to a valid URL in your app. As long as your app responds with some HTML content to insert into the page, it should work.  I'll give an example.  Take a look at `kitchen-sink/index.html`. If you scroll down a bit (search for `messages.html`) you'll see a simple HTML link (`<a>`) to messages.html. When you click that, a request is sent to the server and the contents of `kitchen-sink/messages.html` is returned. Note that messages.html is not a complete HTML page, but only the parts that need to be swapped out.\n\nI'm going to be using this on a web site only, not for PhoneGap or Cordova, but I'm sure it could be used for anything. It's native HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so it's certainly \"native\" web code.\n\n-- Peter\n Mate you aren't the only one waiting patiently for a manual or anything of that type :)\nI am so lost its scary.\n @ptb and @nolimits4web I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your taking the time to give me such a detailed response and overview. Now that I have a clearer picture of what's going on it should have been painfully obvious from the beginning. I am extremely excited to start integrating this into the server admin application I'm building.\n\nNow that my mind is wandering, I thought of two more questions/curiosities.\n\n1) @ptb - You mentioned that you already have this integrated in your rails app. Is the entire app built for the mobile site specifically? Or have you found a way to serve only views/layouts built for Framework7 if an iOS user agent is detected? I'm trying to avoid building a separate application using the same codebase just for this, and as I'm relatively new to rails I can't think of a way to change the entire view rendering structure based on useragent. \n\n2) @nolimits4web and @ptb - Since it's a client-side app running a pretty standard web stack, I should be able to compile the templates and serve them directly from the client, correct? You seem pretty adamant that server-side rendering of the views is required, and especially as the author of this software you know infinitely more about the codebase than I ever will :-P It would just be a tremendous boost if I could handle all the view rendering on the client and only communicate with the server via JSON.\n\nYou guys are great. I am beside myself with excitement about this framework, you have done an absolutely incredible job. As I start my journey down the rabbit hole I will make an honest effort to contribute whatever I possibly can in the way of documentation and bug reports.\n\nThank you again!\n 1) I haven't yet integrated this with my rails app, so far I'm just using Rails as a really intelligent web server. Rails gives me the entire toolset I'm used to using, so I'm more comfortable with it than the Node.js equivalents. This project has been my first real introduction to Node, Less, and Grunt. I only first heard of this project on Friday, so I'm just as new as you are. I do have a lot of experience building web interfaces for iOS, just not with this particular framework.\n\nFor my project, I'm planning on adding an `ios7` class to the `<html>` element (see the end of [this thread](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/pull/9#issuecomment-38638505) for an example of how it could be done) and requiring that class in front of any CSS class declarations. I don't know yet if @nolimits4web will be willing to integrate that idea into this project.\n\n2) Boy are you in luck.  ;)  A couple weeks ago, I was working on a fully client-side Javascript project with Rails, Backbone, Chaplin, and rails-compiled client-side Haml Coffee templates all communicating with Rails via JSON. It's different than working exclusively with Rails, but it certainly can be done: https://github.com/ptb/chaplin_rest\n\nThe majority of this project is all @nolimits4web, if anything I'm a very late addition. He deserves all the credit. :)\n Funny you say that, because this is actually my first month of using rails. And I am **completely** in love. I love rails the way a fat kid loves donuts. Except possibly more love. I've been developing in Node/Express/Mongo/Backbone/Handlebars for a year and a half or so now, and working with rails has been a delight beyond my greatest imaginings.\n\nThat idea sounds pretty solid to me. I am really primarily concerned with how to actually differentiate what views to serve entirely. The entire application isn't a SPA (boss doesn't like taking time to do things the right way) and using this framework would require entirely restructuring the way that views are served if I plan on integrating it into the existing app. Which might not end up happening, which would be no big deal. Just more to learn :)\n\nThat repo looks fantastic! I starred it and will take a closer look later tonight. I must say, I've been intimidated as all hell by Devise, I may or may not end up using your Devise auth code to teach myself how on earth to implement it.\n\nAnd to @nolimits4web the credit shall go then, if you insist! I am just fascinated by everything about how this was executed. The animations run with **zero** jank. Smooth as a baby's butt. And the interface... It's just.... It's a _carbon copy_ of the iOS 7 interface. I very literally have no idea how @nolimits4web (and you too, dammit, @ptb) got it so close. Absolutely indistinguishable from the \"real thing\". \n\nI really do think that's where most of my confusion early came from. It looks absolutely identical to the native interface and I couldn't imagine it being anything other than a compiled native application. \n\nIt's been a long time since I've been as excited about a project as I am right now. How best would I be able to contribute? I know that there's a dire need for documentation, but as far as code goes I would really, really love to help out as well. I am not a guru by any means but I consider myself to be extremely proficient in javascript and really do think I could help out.\n @nolimits4web You guys have done a great job, and I'd like to contribute as much as I can. I'll get working on the demo apps over the weekend. I think I'll start with e-comm demo. Do you have any apps that I can draw some inspirations from? \n Hi Guys,\nThanks for making such an easy to use framework. I want to ask following simple question\n1. When Framework7 requests a template page (e.g. contact.html) from web server, is it possible to add some header information in the request as I need to set the authorization header in it?\n2. When the app is built by phone gap for native use, does it still makes the web server calls for template pages (html) or some how picks it locally?\n\nKinds Regards\nMansoor\n  It'd be good if we pass `xhr` when calling `onAjaxStart` so that one could set custom headers for each ajax request.\n Thank you :)\n  Hey \n\nFirst of all I have to say this is simply amazing. its basically the best HTML5 framework for building iOS apps. simply brilliant.\n\nI was wondering if it was possible to do scroll bounce and pull to refresh like the native apps have? \n i understand, i think native scrolling is important though more than JS scrolling. i wouldn't use JS scrolling just so i can have scroll bounce and pull to load. maybe it should be a module so we can choose JS scroll on certain views and native on certain views? what do you think?\n\n> On Mar 26, 2014, at 6:57 PM, Vladimir Kharlampidi notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> Hey\n> Thanks, i know that it is highly required feature, but because F7 uses native scrolling it is not so simple to make it.

Great job!\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n Yep i can confirm this. I took a video of my screen and watched it in slow motion to understand the animation, it looks like after pulling, the whole list snaps back to the top, then it immediately snaps a little bit back down to display the loading circle. \n Hi! This feature is available at the moment?I did not find an example of it. How to enable it?\n Hi! I mean Scroll Bounce. To scroll in android works on both iphone. Thanks!\n @jeka5555 F7 uses native scrolling, Android just doesn't have it\n Can not be made to work more smoothly it? It is too sharp, and when you scroll a little twitch pictures\n Is there a option just for scrolling with bounce (without refresh action) like iOS has on all pages? Maybe I just cannot find it?\n\nI using iScroll plug-in, but it would be grate if I could ditch that.\n This works well with current Framework7 version to eliminate the bounce effect:\n- 1. Download https://github.com/lazd/iNoBounce/blob/master/inobounce.min.js\n- 2. Include script `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/inobounce.min.js\"></script>`\n- 3. Add css to .views container\n\n```\n.views {\n  height: 100%;\n  overflow: auto;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n}\n```\n  `height: 100%` is set on `.page` by the call to `.full-size()` immediately above.\n  `position: relative` is set on `.views` immediately above.\n  Can you provide an example screenshot of what you're looking for?\n I'm assuming you're looking for something like `-webkit-filter: blur(2px);` but I'm not sure. It would have to blur a separate background element and not any of the text elements.  ;)\n Using CSS filter causes a lot of performance issues. \n SVG filters might be a solution.\n\nhttp://viget.com/inspire/frosted-glass-effect-with-blur-filters-and-masks\n I just randomly stumbled on [this article](http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/2013/10/21/optimizing-gaussian-blurs-mobile-gpu). I didn\u2019t read much of it, but one thing caught my attention: the guy uses OpenGL to do blur.\n\niOS 8 brings WebGL to Safari and web views.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about WebGL, I guess to achieve a live blur effect on HTML elements it would need to take a \u201cscreenshot\u201d of the part to blur and update it live (including, most importantly, when scrolling). Sounds like two impossible things, but maybe you\u2019re determined enough to tinker with this. :)\n Now 2016. Still no chance?\n `backdrop-filter: blur(10px);` should do on iOS devices (no support in Chrome or Firefox)\n Yeah only supported by safari and iOS safari: http://caniuse.com/css-backdrop-filter\n\nBut this enough for iOS theme\n +1 for Frosted glass\n  This corrects most of the incorrect cross-browser flexbox directives.\n\nReference: https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer\nReference: http://jsfiddle.net/LE5ym/2/show/light/\n I'm not 100% happy with the solution for some of the mixins. For example, when I tried passing in `start` into `.align-items(@ai)`, it would be better if `@ai` could be prefixed with `flex-` so the resulting code would be `flex-start`, but every time I tried, it resulted in `flex- start` (with a space). I'm not a less expert though, so maybe you know a workable solution.\n\nThe pull request as is will work, it's just not as elegant as I'd like.\n It's better not to try to use `display: -moz-box`, because it doesn't work in a consistent way compared to other browsers. Firefox before v22 has a number of non-trivial issues with its flexbox implementation:\n- unless a width is set, `display: -moz-box` behaves like `-moz-inline-box`\n- percentage widths are ignored on flexbox items (i.e., must define as px)\n- even if width is defined, items may expand larger than the defined width\n- the setting `-moz-box-pack: justify` (equiv. `justify-content: space-between`) does not work\n- flexbox ignores `overflow: hidden` and expands the flexbox child when the content is larger than the child\u2019s width\n- the outline on flexbox children is padded as if by a transparent border of the same width\n- if you set `-moz-box-flex: 0`, Firefox forces the element to act like it\u2019s using the quirks-mode box model\n\nI spent more than two weeks last summer trying to get Firefox to work consistently. Eventually, I gave up and decided to try to use flexbox only with Webkit-based browsers, with IE 10+, and browsers that support the W3C's final September 2012 standard syntax.\n Basically, you can use `-moz-box` as long as you have no expectations that it will work in a way you expect.  :-)\n I'm not sure how to undo the 'Add .box-shadow' and '@-moz-keyframe' commits. If I drop the commits and force a push into the repo, will it break this pull request, do you know?\n  Simple optimizations:\n0% = 0\n0px = 0\n  According to [this page](http://c2prods.com/2013/cloning-the-ui-of-ios-7-with-html-css-and-javascript/) (in section 2.2), you'd want to use something like this:\n\n`-webkit-transition: all 1s cubic-bezier(.1, .7, .1, 1);\ntransition: all 1s cubic-bezier(.1, .7, .1, 1);`\n\nYou can try out different combinations on this site: [roblaplaca.com](http://www.roblaplaca.com/examples/bezierBuilder/).\n Would love to see this for the scrollTop usages (specifically for new messages.)\n  I converted the PNG versions of the back icon, the 'bars' icon, and the right pointing grey arrow into SVG.\n\nLet me know if any of the changes caused any unintended consequences.\n I'll work on it and get back to you.  :)\n  <code>\n$.getJSON(page, function(data) {\n                      $.each(data, function(key, val) {\n                          if(val==1){\n                              myApp.alert(\"Success\");\n                              window.location.replace(\"<?php echo base_url('index.php/dashboard')?>\");\n                          }else if(val==0){\n                              myApp.alert('Wrong username and password combination!','Login Failed');\n                          }else{\n                              myApp.alert(\"System Error\");\n                          }\n                      });</code>\n\ni wish to redirect to specific page if return value is 1, i tried to do this window.location.replace(\"url\") and window.location.href but failed\n thanks for the quick reply, the result same as the function i provided , it will redirect to the plain code as below\n![ii](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2680257/2497144/554a97f4-b331-11e3-8355-d15eaed0f4bf.png)\n Okay it solved, thank you so much, and sorry for my bad english\n  I reimplemented the .preloader class from the pure CSS + non-semantic HTML elements to SVG with CSS animation.\n\nThe drawback is that it is not as easily re-colored, but two versions based on what I've seen in iOS are included. The default is for use on a light background and another for use on a dark background.  Both are pixel perfect including opacity.\n The Mail activity indicator is the only kind of it's type; it doesn't match any of the others in iOS. The one I made was modeled on the ones from Settings > Wi-Fi and Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup. It is also used by Facebook and Netflix (on a dark background).\n The Mail example is really the outlier. Here's some examples:\n![Settings > Bluetooth > Searching...](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2493672/35736112-b2a1-11e3-9f21-2189ba4bf48b.PNG)\n![Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2493674/357bce7e-b2a1-11e3-8393-cbc9885848ed.PNG)\n![Facebook > Updating...](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2493673/357bcf0a-b2a1-11e3-98bf-3c9f736f5e4e.PNG)\n![Settings > Bluetooth > On](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2493675/3581e426-b2a1-11e3-8170-9fb13d7eb8fa.PNG)\n![Settings > Wi-Fi](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2493676/3586d0f8-b2a1-11e3-8b84-be517111bd33.PNG)\n![Apple Remote](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2493677/358b5592-b2a1-11e3-8d30-161c8c4b9450.PNG)\n I think the reason I put the animation as an :after pseudo-element is to ensure that even if someone put content in the `<span class='preloader'></span>` element, it would still work.  Because the background image is animated with CSS, it rotates the entire element. If there was content inside the `<span>` it would be very confusing.  Your call though.\n\nAs for the name of the class, I don't have a strong opinion on it.  :-)\n  Closes: https://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/issues/7\n I've seen this issue before. I'm looking for my old notes from when I was working on this stuff last summer.\n I tried every combination I could think of, and the issue I thought I had seen before wasn't it. It looks like iOS 6 simply wasn't able to do this, but was fixed in iOS 7.\n\nThis was the first time I'd tried using an SVG as a `-webkit-mask-box-image-source` and slicing it up with `-webkit-mask-box-image-slice`. It might be the first time anybody's tried it because Google was unable to provide any help.\n\nMy suggestion is to handle it similar to the way Modernizr does. Add a CSS class on `<html>` that the CSS can use to select the correct code.\n\nA little bit of Javascript:\n\n```\nfunction iosversion() {\n  if (/iP(hone|od|ad)/.test(navigator.platform)) {\n    // supports iOS 2.0 and later: <http://bit.ly/TJjs1V>\n    var v = (navigator.appVersion).match(/OS (\\d+)_(\\d+)_?(\\d+)?/);\n    return [parseInt(v[1], 10), parseInt(v[2], 10), parseInt(v[3] || 0, 10)];\n  } else {\n    return [0];\n  }\n}\n\nfor (i = 1, m = iosversion()[0]; i <= m; i++) {\n  $('html').addClass('ios' + i);\n}\n```\n\nAnd a little bit of CSS:\n\n```\nhtml.ios7 &.message-last {\n  -webkit-mask-box-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,...\n}\n\nhtml:not([class*='ios7']) &.message-last {\n  border-radius: ...\n}\n```\n This is a quick mockup of what I'm thinking:\n\n```\n.messages-content {\n  background: white;\n}\n\n.messages {\n  display: -webkit-box;\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\n  display: -webkit-flex;\n  display: flex;\n  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;\n  -ms-flex-direction: column;\n  -webkit-flex-direction: column;\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n.messages-date {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: 500;\n  font-size: 11px;\n  line-height: 1;\n  margin: 10px 15px;\n  color: #8e8e93;\n}\n\n.messages-date span {\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n\n.message {\n  font-size: 17px;\n  line-height: 1.2;\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  margin: 1px 10px 0;\n  padding: 6px 16px 9px;\n  min-width: 48px;\n  min-height: 35px;\n  max-width: 60%;\n}\n\n.message-sent {\n  margin-left: auto;\n  padding-right: 22px;\n  -ms-flex-item-align: end;\n  -webkit-align-self: flex-end;\n  align-self: flex-end;\n  background-color: #00d449;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n.message-received {\n  padding-left: 22px;\n  -ms-flex-item-align: start;\n  -webkit-align-self: flex-start;\n  align-self: flex-start;\n  background-color: #e5e5ea;\n  color: black;\n}\n\n.message.message-last {\n  margin-bottom: 8px;\n}\n\n.message.message-pic {\n  padding: 0;\n  background: none;\n}\n.message.message-pic img {\n  display: block;\n  height: auto;\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n\n.message-appear {\n  -webkit-animation: messageAppear 400ms;\n  animation: messageAppear 400ms;\n}\n\n:root:not([class*='ios7']) .message,\n:root:not([class*='ios7']) .message.message-pic img {\n  border-radius: 16px;\n}\n\n:root:not([class*='ios7']) .message-sent.message-last,\n:root:not([class*='ios7']) .message-sent.message-last.message-pic img {\n  border-bottom-right-radius: 0;\n}\n\n:root:not([class*='ios7']) .message-received.message-last,\n:root:not([class*='ios7']) .message-received.message-last.message-pic img {\n  border-bottom-left-radius: 0;\n}\n\n:root.ios7 .message-sent {\n  -webkit-mask-box-image-source: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg height='35' viewBox='0 0 96 70' width='48' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='m84 35c1 7-5 37-42 35-37 2-43-28-42-35-1-7 5-37 42-35 37-2 43 28 42 35z'/></svg>\");\n  -webkit-mask-box-image-slice: 49.5% 55.75% 49.5% 43.25% fill;\n}\n\n:root.ios7 .message-sent.message-last {\n  -webkit-mask-box-image-source: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg height='35' viewBox='0 0 96 70' width='48' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='m84 35c1 7-5 37-42 35-37 2-43-28-42-35-1-7 5-37 42-35 37-2 43 28 42 35z'/><path d='m96 70c-6-2-12-10-12-19v-16l-14 27s8 8 26 8z'/></svg>\");\n}\n\n:root.ios7 .message-received {\n  -webkit-mask-box-image-source: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg height='35' viewBox='0 0 96 70' width='48' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='m96 35c1 7-5 37-42 35-37 2-43-28-42-35-1-7 5-37 42-35 37-2 43 28 42 35z'/></svg>\");\n  -webkit-mask-box-image-slice: 49.5% 43.25% 49.5% 55.75% fill;\n}\n\n:root.ios7 .message-received.message-last {\n  -webkit-mask-box-image-source: url(\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg height='35' viewBox='0 0 96 70' width='48' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><path d='m96 35c1 7-5 37-42 35-37 2-43-28-42-35-1-7 5-37 42-35 37-2 43 28 42 35z'/><path d='m0 70c6-2 12-10 12-19v-16l14 27s-8 8-26 8z'/></svg>\");\n}\n\n@-webkit-keyframes messageAppear {\n  from {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);\n  }\n\n  to {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n@keyframes messageAppear {\n  from {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);\n    -ms-transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);\n    transform: translate3d(0, 100%, 0);\n  }\n\n  to {\n    -webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n    -ms-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n    transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're interested, I'll put together another pull request.  It would require the Javascript I included above integrated somewhere in order to work.\n I think if the code was `:root.ios1:not([class*='ios7'])` that way it will only apply if it was on a version of iOS previous to iOS 7.\n\nAs for why `:root` and not `html`, there's really no good reason. It exists specifically in the [CSS3 Selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#root-pseudo) spec, so I figured why not use it. I write enough HTML5 and SVG (it would automatically match the `<svg>` element in an SVG document) that it's just habit for me. If you feel it makes the code easier to understand if it was `html` instead of `:root` I can make that change.\n  \u042f \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044e \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u043d\u0435\u0442(\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0442\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a-\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b): http://taxi-lite.ru/file/ - \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f?

If you're interested in moving in this direction, I could put together a pull request, if not, I won't bother.\n\nHere's a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ptb/9692359) and a [preview](http://rawgithub.com/ptb/9692359/raw/1005493a810122da3846898437c7e03f0d3643d4/messages.html).\n\nI have Settings > General > Accessibility > Bold Text turned on on my iOS devices, so the boldness might not match the typical. I could fix that.\n\nAlso, some of the flexbox code isn't correct. I've documented every option of shipping browser's implementation of flexbox (including links to the sources) here: http://ptb2.me/flexbox/  I could help with that, too.\n I updated the [gist](https://gist.github.com/ptb/9692359) using -webkit-mask-box-image.  That was a very good idea, it makes a lot of things possible.  Here's the [updated demo](http://rawgithub.com/ptb/9692359/raw/7f2531e20bc6ab006601046304d6e87ac2ab1cba/messages.html)\n\nI'll adjust the radius of the corners next. Easy to do.\n I took a screen shot with a one character message from my iPhone 5, and this is the result: ![example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2491290/a69560dc-b1e5-11e3-9e43-189ad5c9426b.PNG)\n\nWith the current code (not yet in the gist) this is what it is rendering as: \n![example](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5335/2491303/13c86f82-b1e6-11e3-9e55-5e1638ddeda1.png)\n\nAre you saying it should be narrower than the real iOS? For simplicity, the SVG masks handle the shape of both the round bubbles and the the ones with \"tails\", that way they match without adjusting margins or padding, etc. If you want it \"rounder\", the min-width can simply be changed to 40px (or removed altogether), but it was set to match Apple's implementation.\n I'll make a PR.  :-)\n I percent encoded it based on [David Bushell's](http://dbushell.com/2013/02/04/a-primer-to-front-end-svg-hacking/) recommendation, but according to him, it \"only works on Safari and Chrome\". Since -webkit-mask-box-image will only work on Webkit-based browsers anyway, it seems like it won't be an issue. I tested it as a background-image on Firefox 28 and it didn't have a problem either. I don't have a copy of IE readily available to test.\n\nI changed the data URI of one of the images to see if I could make it break. I tried uploading the page to a web server configured to serve the file as ISO-2022-JP, and it still displayed correctly. (Granted all of the characters in the content are in the ASCII character set, so it shouldn't be an issue anyway.) Even though it is not to spec ([RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397) and [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)), I think you're right and it should just be used unescaped.\n\nAlso, [dbushell.com](http://dbushell.com/2013/02/04/a-primer-to-front-end-svg-hacking/) says that base64 encoding is always smaller, but he's wrong. When sending the page over the wire, it (should be) sent as gzip. Since the content is text, gzip is able to compress it much more than if it was base64 encoded.\n And I tried validating it without percent encoding on http://validator.w3.org and http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and neither of them had a problem with it.\n I updated the [gist](http://rawgithub.com/ptb/9692359/raw/2cf382192ebea6305b8313d47a3c5d48de5d2577/messages.html).\n Are you opposed (or know more than I do why it might be a bad idea) to [simplify the CSS class naming](https://github.com/ptb/Framework7/blob/0f262df8e926b9e5454bfc209c54032f455176b3/src/less/messages.less) for messages?  I made the proposed changes [here](https://github.com/ptb/Framework7/commit/0f262df8e926b9e5454bfc209c54032f455176b3).  Basically, shorten the class names and use the semantic HTML elements instead of `<div>` as recommended in the [HTML5 working draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/common-idioms.html#conversations)?\n I didn't even think of `<p>` not being appropriate except for inline elements. Good call.\n  In iOS 7.1 beta 2 was added another `viewport` meta tag option: `minimal-ui`. Which slightly minimize Safari UI, thus it can create native app like feel.\n\nYou can observe diff:\n\n_Without `minimal-ui` to the left and with `minimal-ui` to the right._\n\n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/uKrRfoN.png\" target=\"blank_\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uKrRfoN.png\" width=\"200\"></a> <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/NRAHuBQ.png\" target=\"blank_\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NRAHuBQ.png\" width=\"200\"></a>\n Hm, let me check this.\n :) \u042f \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b. \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b. \u042f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e \u0434\u044b\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043f-\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d. \u0422\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e, \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c\u0443, \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043f-\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430. \u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u044c\u044e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e, \u0430 \u0442.\u043a. \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443, \u0442\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0439\u0430\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445, \u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0443 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0434\u044b\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043f-\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0443 :)\n\n\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0438\u043d\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b?\n :+1: \u0411\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u0432 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043c.\n  on ios emulator,i just copy dist code into cordova ios project,and i click the page1 or page2 tab,it does not show the linked page.\nbut on chrome,it worked.\n  Just donwloaded, placed files in project directory and from there ran \"npm install\" and \"grunt build\".

But,  this did not work.\n I figured you had that built in. \nAnd it works.  Thanks...  \nI am loving this so far.. BTW\n You know,  One of the biggest problems with \"auto ajax links\"  is the fact that so much work has to go into changing classes in pre-built applications.  Think in terms of WP or Joomla components.  Do you think that it would be better to scan links for class \"link\" and then when they are found activate the ajax call?  Then the page would act as normal html/php.\n Yes,  or even data attribute links,  for example...\nI run into this problem all the time.   I am going to be merging your work with Joomla and I can assure you that the system you have in place now would work fine for top level nav.  But,  as soon as you load a component that may use its own js framework... things go haywire..  and 99% of CMS use components..\n Just makes sense if you want it to plug and play nice..  plus I think that you will see larger usage.\n One more example for you\nI build a component for Joomla and use your framework.   If I were to do that as it is now.  The component would hijack the entire site templates links.\n What if there's a parameter passed along with a link: `.html?q=3`. In this case `ajaxLinks` option doesn't work for me.\n\nI think there should be another option to handle external links. At least by assigning `external-link` class.\n Ok, now I see it was already solved with [`external` class](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/pages-ajax.html).\n I used have external class to but it's not working in android app. care to elaborate? @iamsudharshan If you're using cordova, you need to whitelist the external site in order to allow navigation, access or intent.  It would be really awesome if one can swipe between tabs. An inspiration would be http://ionicframework.com/tutorials/intro-tutorial/. \n +1 \nI'm guessing that swiper.js is compatible with this framework? It would be nice to have a swipe gallery in the demo\n Haven't had a chance to play with this but it looks great so far and swiper compatibility will be extremely helpful. Do you plan to add multi gesture support (pinch, drag, pull, ect)? \n @nolimits4web I guess they aren't required but my personal usage of this would be for prototyping apps in which case I would love the ability to easily program swipe's, snaps, drags ect \n\nI'm sure you want to keep this very light on the js as it's a mobile plugin, perhaps there could be a heavy version with more app like features such as:\n\nswipe forward/reverse through pages, tabs ect\nswipe galleries \nselect/deslect/drag organize lists \nlight box gallery \nscroll stick scroll lists (like address) \nnav/footer hide/show on scroll up/down\n\nThese are just things that I could see myself trying to figure out how to code into the framework for different projects. As long as the framework accepts other plugins and custom JS i'm sure it will work much better than the other framework's i've tried to use in the past. \n\nAwesome work so far!\nthanks\n @criesner i agree to add swiper.js but, multi gesture seems to be kinda trivial for this framework at this stage of its life\n\nMight want to just use hammerjs for now\n", "text_all_count": 137980,
